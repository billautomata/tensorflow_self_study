ACT I,0
Enter KING HENRY LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER the EARL of WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and others,0
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,0
To be commenced in strands afar remote.,0
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;,0
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs,0
Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven,0
Did lately meet in the intestine shock,0
Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks,0
Against acquaintance kindred and allies:,0
No more shall cut his master. Therefore friends,0
Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross,0
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;,0
To chase these pagans in those holy fields,0
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd,0
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,0
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear,0
What yesternight our council did decree,0
My liege this haste was hot in question,0
But yesternight: when all athwart there came,0
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,0
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,0
A thousand of his people butchered;,0
Such beastly shameless transformation,0
Without much shame retold or spoken of.,0
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.,0
For more uneven and unwelcome news,0
On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,0
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,0
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,0
And shape of likelihood the news was told;,0
And pride of their contention did take horse,0
Here is a dear a true industrious friend,0
Stain'd with the variation of each soil,0
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.,0
Ten thousand bold Scots two and twenty knights,0
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took,0
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,0
And is not this an honourable spoil?,0
In faith,0
Yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin,0
Should be the father to so blest a son,0
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;,0
Whilst I by looking on the praise of him,0
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved,0
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,0
Then would I have his Harry and he mine.,0
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,0
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,0
This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,0
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up,0
But I have sent for him to answer this;,0
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.,0
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:,0
For more is to be said and to be done,0
I will my liege.,0
SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.,0
Now Hal what time of day is it lad?,0
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon,0
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.,0
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes,0
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself,0
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand,0
Indeed you come near me now Hal; for we that take,0
by Phoebus he'that wandering knight so fair.' And,0
save thy grace--majesty I should say for grace,0
What none?,0
prologue to an egg and butter.,0
Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not,0
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's,0
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,0
chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal.,0
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and,0
by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold,0
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with,0
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder,0
By the Lord thou sayest true lad. And is not my,0
As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle. And,0
How now how now mad wag! what in thy quips and,0
buff jerkin?,0
Well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a,0
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?,0
Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch;,0
Yea and so used it that were it not here apparent,0
wag shall there be gallows standing in England when,0
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do,0
No; thou shalt.,0
Thou judgest false already: I mean thou shalt have,0
Well Hal well; and in some sort it jumps with my,0
you.,0
Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman,0
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.,0
Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.,0
Moor-ditch?,0
the most comparative rascalliest sweet young,0
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a,0
lord of the council rated me the other day in the,0
he talked very wisely but I regarded him not; and,0
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the,0
O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able,0
me Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew,0
should speak truly little better than one of the,0
it over: by the Lord and I do not I am a villain:,0
Christendom.,0
Zounds where thou wilt lad; I'll make one; an I,0
I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying,0
Why Hal 'tis my vocation Hal; 'tis no sin for a,0
Enter POINS,0
match. O if men were to be saved by merit what,0
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to,0
Good morrow Ned.,0
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how,0
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira,0
Sir John stands to his word the devil shall have,0
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.,0
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.,0
o'clock early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going,0
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards,0
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke,0
as secure as sleep. If you will go I will stuff,0
at home and be hanged.,0
I'll hang you for going.,0
Hal wilt thou make one?,0
There's neither honesty manhood nor good,0
royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.,0
Why that's well said.,0
By the Lord I'll be a traitor then when thou art king.,0
Sir John I prithee leave the prince and me alone:,0
that he shall go.,0
the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may,0
true prince may for recreation sake prove a false,0
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.,0
Exit Falstaff,0
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot,0
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:,0
have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut,0
How shall we part with them in setting forth?,0
appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at,0
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have,0
Yea but 'tis like that they will know us by our,0
appointment to be ourselves.,0
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we,0
for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments.,0
Well for two of them I know them to be as,0
third if he fight longer than he sees reason I'll,0
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will,0
least he fought with; what wards what blows what,0
lies the jest.,0
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;,0
Farewell my lord.,0
I know you all and will awhile uphold,0
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,0
To smother up his beauty from the world,0
Being wanted he may be more wonder'd at,0
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.,0
To sport would be as tedious as to work;,0
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.,0
And pay the debt I never promised,0
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;,0
My reformation glittering o'er my fault,0
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.,0
Redeeming time when men think least I will.,0
SCENE III. London. The palace.,0
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,0
And you have found me; for accordingly,0
I will from henceforth rather be myself,0
Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down,0
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.,0
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;,0
Have holp to make so portly.,0
Worcester get thee gone; for I do see,0
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory,0
The moody frontier of a servant brow.,0
Your use and counsel we shall send for you.,0
You were about to speak.,0
Yea my good lord.,0
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,0
As is deliver'd to your majesty:,0
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.,0
But I remember when the fight was done,0
Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword,0
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd,0
He was perfumed like a milliner;,0
A pouncet-box which ever and anon,0
Who therewith angry when it next came there,0
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,0
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse,0
With many holiday and lady terms,0
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.,0
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,0
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,0
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,0
Of guns and drums and wounds--God save the mark!--,0
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;,0
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd,0
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd,0
He would himself have been a soldier.,0
I answer'd indirectly as I said;,0
Come current for an accusation,0
The circumstance consider'd good my lord,0
To such a person and in such a place,0
May reasonably die and never rise,0
What then he said so he unsay it now.,0
But with proviso and exception,0
His brother-in-law the foolish Mortimer;,0
The lives of those that he did lead to fight,0
Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March,0
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?,0
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?,0
For I shall never hold that man my friend,0
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.,0
He never did fall off my sovereign liege,0
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,0
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,0
He did confound the best part of an hour,0
Three times they breathed and three times did,0
Upon agreement of swift Severn's flood;,0
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,0
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.,0
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;,0
Receive so many and all willingly:,0
Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him;,0
I tell thee,0
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.,0
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:,0
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me,0
We licence your departure with your son.,0
Exeunt King Henry Blunt and train,0
I will not send them: I will after straight,0
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.,0
Here comes your uncle.,0
Speak of Mortimer!,0
Want mercy if I do not join with him:,0
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,0
As high in the air as this unthankful king,0
Brother the king hath made your nephew mad.,0
He will forsooth have all my prisoners;,0
Of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale,0
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.,0
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?,0
And then it was when the unhappy king,0
Upon his Irish expedition;,0
To be deposed and shortly murdered.,0
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.,0
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer,0
He did; myself did hear it.,0
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.,0
Upon the head of this forgetful man,0
Of murderous subornation shall it be,0
Being the agents or base second means,0
O pardon me that I descend so low,0
Wherein you range under this subtle king;,0
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,0
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,0
To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose,0
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,0
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?,0
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves,0
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt,0
To answer all the debt he owes to you,0
Therefore I say--,0
And now I will unclasp a secret book,0
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,0
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud,0
If he fall in good night! or sink or swim:,0
So honour cross it from the north to south,0
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!,0
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.,0
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,0
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,0
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear,0
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!,0
But not the form of what he should attend.,0
I cry you mercy.,0
That are your prisoners--,0
By God he shall not have a Scot of them;,0
I'll keep them by this hand.,0
And lend no ear unto my purposes.,0
Nay I will; that's flat:,0
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;,0
And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!',0
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak,0
To keep his anger still in motion.,0
All studies here I solemnly defy,0
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,0
And would be glad he met with some mischance,0
Farewell kinsman: I'll talk to you,0
Why what a wasp-stung and impatient fool,0
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!,0
Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear,0
In Richard's time--what do you call the place?--,0
Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,0
Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke--,0
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.,0
You say true:,0
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!,0
And 'gentle Harry Percy' and 'kind cousin;',0
Good uncle tell your tale; I have done.,0
We will stay your leisure.,0
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.,0
And make the Douglas' son your only mean,0
Which I shall send you written be assured,0
To Northumberland,0
Shall secretly into the bosom creep,0
The archbishop.,0
True; who bears hard,0
I speak not this in estimation,0
Is ruminated plotted and set down,0
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.,0
Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.,0
And then the power of Scotland and of York,0
And so they shall.,0
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,0
For bear ourselves as even as we can,0
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,0
And see already how he doth begin,0
He does he does: we'll be revenged on him.,0
Than I by letters shall direct your course.,0
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;,0
As I will fashion it shall happily meet,0
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.,0
Uncle Adieu: O let the hours be short,0
Exeunt,0
SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.,0
Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day I'll be,0
yet our horse not packed. What ostler!,0
I prithee Tom beat Cut's saddle put a few flocks,0
of all cess.,0
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog and that,0
house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.,0
rose; it was the death of him.,0
London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.,0
christen could be better bit than I have been since,0
Why they will allow us ne'er a jordan and then we,0
fleas like a loach.,0
I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,0
God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite,0
never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An,0
on thee I am a very villain. Come and be hanged!,0
Enter GADSHILL,0
I think it be two o'clock.,0
in the stable.,0
I pray thee lend me thine.,0
he? marry I'll see thee hanged first.,0
Time enough to go to bed with a candle I warrant,0
gentleman: they will along with company for they,0
Exeunt carriers,0
[Within]  At hand quoth pick-purse.,0
chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking,0
thou layest the plot how.,0
Good morrow Master Gadshill. It holds current that,0
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with,0
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one,0
They are up already and call for eggs and butter;,0
Sirrah if they meet not with Saint Nicholas',0
No I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the,0
as truly as a man of falsehood may.,0
I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang old,0
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou,0
content to do the profession some grace; that would,0
credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no,0
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;,0
great oneyers such as can hold in such as will,0
drink and drink sooner than pray: and yet zounds,0
commonwealth; or rather not pray to her but prey,0
her their boots.,0
out water in foul way?,0
steal as in a castle cocksure; we have the receipt,0
Nay by my faith I think you are more beholding to,0
Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our,0
Nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief.,0
ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,0
Exeunt,0
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS,0
horse and he frets like a gummed velvet.,0
Enter FALSTAFF,0
Peace ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost,0
Where's Poins Hal?,0
I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the,0
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier,0
not but to die a fair death for all this if I,0
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and,0
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me,0
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!,0
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere,0
leave these rogues I am the veriest varlet that,0
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;,0
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!,0
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse you,0
Peace ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close,0
of travellers.,0
Sblood I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot,0
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?,0
I prithee good Prince Hal help me to my horse,0
Out ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?,0
garters! If I be ta'en I'll peach for this. An I,0
tunes let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest,0
Enter GADSHILL BARDOLPH and PETO,0
So I do against my will.,0
what news?,0
money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going,0
You lie ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.,0
To be hanged.,0
Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape,0
How many be there of them?,0
Zounds will they not rob us?,0
Indeed I am not John of Gaunt your grandfather;,0
Well we leave that to the proof.,0
when thou needest him there thou shalt find him.,0
Now cannot I strike him if I should be hanged.,0
Here hard by: stand close.,0
Now my masters happy man be his dole say I:,0
Enter the Travellers,0
the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs.,0
Jesus bless us!,0
ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they,0
O we are undone both we and ours for ever!,0
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,0
You are Grand-jurors are ye? we'll jure ye 'faith.,0
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS,0
and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London it,0
and a good jest for ever.,0
Enter the Thieves again,0
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two,0
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.,0
Villains!,0
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:,0
So strongly that they dare not meet each other;,0
Away good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,0
Were 't not for laughing I should pity him.,0
Exeunt,0
Enter HOTSPUR solus reading a letter,0
contented to be there in respect of the love I bear,0
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:,0
he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The,0
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to,0
nettle danger we pluck this flower safety. 'The,0
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and,0
great an opposition.' Say you so say you so? I say,0
you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,0
friends true and constant: a good plot good,0
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is,0
general course of action. 'Zounds an I were now by,0
Is there not my father my uncle and myself? lord,0
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all,0
next month? and are they not some of them set,0
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity,0
open all our proceedings. O I could divide myself,0
skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!,0
forward to-night.,0
How now Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.,0
For what offence have I this fortnight been,0
Tell me sweet lord what is't that takes from thee,0
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,0
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;,0
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?,0
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;,0
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd,0
Of palisadoes frontiers parapets,0
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,0
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,0
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,0
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,0
On some great sudden hest. O what portents are these?,0
And I must know it else he loves me not.,0
Enter Servant,0
He is my lord an hour ago.,0
One horse my lord he brought even now.,0
It is my lord.,0
Well I will back him straight: O esperance!,0
Exit Servant,0
What say'st thou my lady?,0
Why my horse my love my horse.,0
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen,0
I'll know your business Harry that I will.,0
About his title and hath sent for you,0
So far afoot I shall be weary love.,0
Directly unto this question that I ask:,0
An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.,0
Away you trifler! Love! I love thee not,0
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:,0
And pass them current too. God's me my horse!,0
have with me?,0
Well do not then; for since you love me not,0
Nay tell me if you speak in jest or no.,0
And when I am on horseback I will swear,0
I must not have you henceforth question me,0
Whither I must I must; and to conclude,0
I know you wise but yet no farther wise,0
But yet a woman: and for secrecy,0
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;,0
How! so far?,0
Whither I go thither shall you go too;,0
Will this content you Kate?,0
Exeunt,0
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS,0
thy hand to laugh a little.,0
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four,0
base-string of humility. Sirrah I am sworn brother,0
their christen names as Tom Dick and Francis.,0
though I be but the prince of Wales yet I am king,0
like Falstaff but a Corinthian a lad of mettle a,0
am king of England I shall command all the good,0
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering they,0
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,0
during my life. I tell thee Ned thou hast lost,0
action. But sweet Ned--to sweeten which name of,0
even now into my hand by an under-skinker one that,0
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome' with,0
of bastard in the Half-Moon' or so. But Ned to,0
do thou stand in some by-room while I question my,0
thou never leave calling 'Francis' that his tale,0
I'll show thee a precedent.,0
Thou art perfect.,0
Exit POINS,0
Anon anon sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet Ralph.,0
My lord?,0
Forsooth five years and as much as to--,0
Anon anon sir.,0
of pewter. But Francis darest thou be so valiant,0
a fair pair of heels and run from it?,0
England I could find in my heart.,0
Anon sir.,0
Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--,0
Anon sir. Pray stay a little my lord.,0
gavest me'twas a pennyworth wast't not?,0
I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me,0
[Within]  Francis!,0
Anon Francis? No Francis; but to-morrow Francis;,0
thou wilt. But Francis!,0
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin crystal-button,0
smooth-tongue Spanish-pouch--,0
Why then your brown bastard is your only drink;,0
will sully: in Barbary sir it cannot come to so much.,0
[Within]  Francis!,0
Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed not knowing which way to go,0
What standest thou still and hearest such a,0
Exit Francis,0
at the door: shall I let them in?,0
Exit Vintner,0
Re-enter POINS,0
Sirrah Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at,0
As merry as crickets my lad. But hark ye; what,0
drawer? come what's the issue?,0
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the,0
Re-enter FRANCIS,0
Anon anon sir.,0
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a,0
upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of,0
Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or,0
hands and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet,0
how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan,0
fourteen' an hour after; 'a trifle a trifle.' I,0
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his,0
Enter FALSTAFF GADSHILL BARDOLPH and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine,0
A plague of all cowards I say and a vengeance too!,0
lead this life long I'll sew nether stocks and mend,0
Give me a cup of sack rogue. Is there no virtue extant?,0
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?,0
of the sun's! if thou didst then behold that compound.,0
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:,0
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways old Jack;,0
not forgot upon the face of the earth then am I a,0
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and,0
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any,0
How now wool-sack! what mutter you?,0
kingdom with a dagger of lath and drive all thy,0
I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!,0
Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?,0
Lord I'll stab thee.,0
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I,0
enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your,0
plague upon such backing! give me them that will,0
drunk to-day.,0

He drinks,0
What's the matter?,0
ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.,0
Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon,0
What a hundred man?,0
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by,0
doublet four through the hose; my buckler cut,0
hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since,0
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or,0
Speak sirs; how was it?,0
Sixteen at least my lord.,0
No no they were not bound.,0
am a Jew else an Ebrew Jew.,0
And unbound the rest and then come in the other.,0
All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought,0
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old,0
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.,0
of them; two I am sure I have paid two rogues,0
thee a lie spit in my face call me horse. Thou,0
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--,0
Four Hal; I told thee four.,0
These four came all a-front and mainly thrust at,0
points in my target thus.,0
In buckram?,0
Seven by these hilts or I am a villain else.,0
Dost thou hear me Hal?,0
Do so for it is worth the listening to. These nine,0
So two more already.,0
Down fell their hose.,0
came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of,0
O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!,0
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive,0
not see thy hand.,0
gross as a mountain open palpable. Why thou,0
whoreson obscene grease tallow-catch--,0
the truth?,0
green when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy,0
Come your reason Jack your reason.,0
strappado or all the racks in the world I would,0
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as,0
compulsion I.,0
coward this bed-presser this horseback-breaker,0
Sblood you starveling you elf-skin you dried,0
for breath to utter what is like thee! you,0
standing-tuck--,0
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,0
Mark Jack.,0
were masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain,0
four; and with a word out-faced you from your,0
the house: and Falstaff you carried your guts,0
for mercy and still run and roared as ever I heard,0
as thou hast done and then say it was in fight!,0
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and,0
Come let's hear Jack; what trick hast thou now?,0
Why hear you my masters: was it for me to kill the,0
why thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but,0
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a,0
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant,0
lads I am glad you have the money. Hostess clap,0
Gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles,0
merry? shall we have a play extempore?,0
Ah no more of that Hal an thou lovest me!,0
O Jesu my lord the prince!,0
me?,0
door would speak with you: he says he comes from,0
Give him as much as will make him a royal man and,0
What manner of man is he?,0
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall,0
Prithee do Jack.,0
Exit FALSTAFF,0
Peto; so did you Bardolph: you are lions too you,0
prince; no fie!,0
Faith tell me now in earnest how came Falstaff's,0
Why he hacked it with his dagger and said he would,0
believe it was done in fight and persuaded us to do the like.,0
make them bleed and then to beslubber our garments,0
did that I did not this seven year before I blushed,0
O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years,0
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and,0
instinct hadst thou for it?,0
these exhalations?,0
What think you they portend?,0
Choler my lord if rightly taken.,0
Re-enter FALSTAFF,0
How now my sweet creature of bombast!,0
My own knee! when I was about thy years Hal I was,0
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of,0
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was,0
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the,0
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the,0
hook--what a plague call you him?,0
Owen Owen the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,0
Scots Douglas that runs o' horseback up a hill,0
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol,0
You have hit it.,0
Well that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.,0
for running!,0
Yes Jack upon instinct.,0
and one Mordake and a thousand blue-caps more:,0
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy,0
Why then it is like if there come a hot June and,0
as they buy hob-nails by the hundreds.,0
shall have good trading that way. But tell me Hal,0
heir-apparent could the world pick thee out three,0
spirit Percy and that devil Glendower? Art thou,0
it?,0
Well thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou,0
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the,0
Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,0
Thy state is taken for a joined-stool thy golden,0
crown for a pitiful bald crown!,0
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to,0
wept; for I must speak in passion and I will do it,0
Well here is my leg.,0
O Jesu this is excellent sport i' faith!,0
O the father how he holds his countenance!,0
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.,0
players as ever I see!,0
Harry I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy,0
the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster,0
sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have,0
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a,0
me. If then thou be son to me here lies the point;,0
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat,0
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a,0
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to,0
as ancient writers do report doth defile; so doth,0
speak to thee in drink but in tears not in,0
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I,0
What manner of man an it like your majesty?,0
cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble,0
by'r lady inclining to three score; and now I,0
should be lewdly given he deceiveth me; for Harry,0
known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then,0
Falstaff: him keep with the rest banish. And tell,0
thou been this month?,0
and I'll play my father.,0
majestically both in word and matter hang me up by,0
Well here I am set.,0
Now Harry whence come you?,0
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.,0
ye for a young prince i' faith.,0
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:,0
old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why,0
bolting-hutch of beastliness that swollen parcel,0
cloak-bag of guts that roasted Manningtree ox with,0
grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in,0
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a,0
wherein crafty but in villany? wherein villanous,0
I would your grace would take me with you: whom,0
That villanous abominable misleader of youth,0
My lord the man I know.,0
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,0
more the pity his white hairs do witness it; but,0
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,0
sin then many an old host that I know is damned: if,0
are to be loved. No my good lord; banish Peto,0
Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff,0
being as he is old Jack Falstaff banish not him,0
company: banish plump Jack and banish all the world.,0
A knocking heard,0
Re-enter BARDOLPH running,0
monstrous watch is at the door.,0
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.,0
O Jesu my lord my lord!,0
what's the matter?,0
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?,0
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,0
And thou a natural coward without instinct.,0
so; if not let him enter: if I become not a cart,0
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.,0
above. Now my masters for a true face and good,0
Both which I have had: but their date is out and,0
Call in the sheriff.,0
Enter Sheriff and the Carrier,0
First pardon me my lord. A hue and cry,0
What men?,0
A gross fat man.,0
The man I do assure you is not here;,0
And sheriff I will engage my word to thee,0
Send him to answer thee or any man,0
And so let me entreat you leave the house.,0
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.,0
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.,0
I think it is good morrow is it not?,0
Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier,0
call him forth.,0
snorting like a horse.,0
He searcheth his pockets and findeth certain papers,0
Nothing but papers my lord.,0
[Reads]  Item A capon. . 2s. 2d.,0
Item Sack two gallons 5s. 8d.,0
Item Bread        ob.,0
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,0
let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the,0
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a,0
march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid,0
the morning; and so good morrow Peto.,0
Good morrow good my lord.,0
SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.,0
These promises are fair the parties sure,0
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,0
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!,0
No here it is.,0
For by that name as oft as Lancaster,0
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.,0
I cannot blame him: at my nativity,0
Of burning cressets; and at my birth,0
Shaked like a coward.,0
your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself,0
I say the earth did shake when I was born.,0
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.,0
O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,0
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth,0
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd,0
Within her womb; which for enlargement striving,0
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth,0
In passion shook.,0
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave,0
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,0
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.,0
And all the courses of my life do show,0
Where is he living clipp'd in with the sea,0
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?,0
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,0
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.,0
Peace cousin Percy; you will make him mad.,0
Why so can I or so can any man;,0
Why I can teach you cousin to command,0
And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil,0
If thou have power to raise him bring him hither,0
O while you live tell truth and shame the devil!,0
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head,0
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him,0
Home without boots and in foul weather too!,0
Come here's the map: shall we divide our right,0
The archdeacon hath divided it,0
England from Trent and Severn hitherto,0
All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore,0
To Owen Glendower: and dear coz to you,0
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;,0
A business that this night may execute,0
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth,0
As is appointed us at Shrewsbury.,0
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.,0
Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen.,0
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;,0
For there will be a world of water shed,0
Methinks my moiety north from Burton here,0
See how this river comes me cranking in,0
A huge half-moon a monstrous cantle out.,0
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run,0
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,0
Not wind? it shall it must; you see it doth.,0
Mark how he bears his course and runs me up,0
Gelding the opposed continent as much,0
Yea but a little charge will trench him here,0
And then he runs straight and even.,0
I'll not have it alter'd.,0
No nor you shall not.,0
Why that will I.,0
I can speak English lord as well as you;,0
Where being but young I framed to the harp,0
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,0
Marry,0
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew,0
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,0
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,0
Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.,0
I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land,0
But in the way of bargain mark ye me,0
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?,0
I'll haste the writer and withal,0
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,0
Exit GLENDOWER,0
I cannot choose: sometime he angers me,0
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,0
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,0
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff,0
He held me last night at least nine hours,0
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum' and 'well go to',0
As a tired horse a railing wife;,0
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far,0
In any summer-house in Christendom.,0
Exceedingly well read and profited,0
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful,0
He holds your temper in a high respect,0
When you come 'cross his humour; faith he does:,0
Might so have tempted him as you have done,0
But do not use it oft let me entreat you.,0
And since your coming hither have done enough,0
You must needs learn lord to amend this fault:,0
And that's the dearest grace it renders you--,0
Defect of manners want of government,0
The least of which haunting a nobleman,0
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,0
Well I am school'd: good manners be your speed!,0
Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies,0
My wife can speak no English I no Welsh.,0
She'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars.,0
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.,0
She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,0
The lady speaks in Welsh,0
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens,0
In such a parley should I answer thee.,0
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,0
But I will never be a truant love,0
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,0
With ravishing division to her lute.,0
The lady speaks again in Welsh,0
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down,0
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you,0
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,0
As is the difference betwixt day and night,0
Begins his golden progress in the east.,0
By that time will our book I think be drawn,0
And those musicians that shall play to you,0
And straight they shall be here: sit and attend.,0
quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap.,0
The music plays,0
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.,0
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are,0
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.,0
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?,0
Then be still.,0
Now God help thee!,0
What's that?,0
Here the lady sings a Welsh song,0
Not mine in good sooth.,0
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you in good sooth' and,0
as sure as day',0
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.,0
A good mouth-filling oath and leave 'in sooth',0
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.,0
I will not sing.,0
teacher. An the indentures be drawn I'll away,0
Exit,0
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.,0
And then to horse immediately.,0
Exeunt,0
Enter KING HENRY IV PRINCE HENRY and others,0
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,0
Exeunt Lords,0
For some displeasing service I have done,0
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;,0
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd,0
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,0
Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts,0
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,0
And hold their level with thy princely heart?,0
Quit all offences with as clear excuse,0
Myself of many I am charged withal:,0
As in reproof of many tales devised,0
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,0
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,0
God pardon thee! yet let me wonder Harry,0
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.,0
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,0
Of all the court and princes of my blood:,0
Is ruin'd and the soul of every man,0
Had I so lavish of my presence been,0
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,0
Had still kept loyal to possession,0
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.,0
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;,0
Others would say 'Where which is Bolingbroke?',0
And dress'd myself in such humility,0
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,0
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;,0
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,0
And won by rareness such solemnity.,0
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,0
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,0
And gave his countenance against his name,0
Of every beardless vain comparative,0
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;,0
They surfeited with honey and began,0
More than a little is by much too much.,0
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,0
As sick and blunted with community,0
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty,0
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,0
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,0
And in that very line Harry standest thou;,0
With vile participation: not an eye,0
Save mine which hath desired to see thee more;,0
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.,0
Be more myself.,0
As thou art to this hour was Richard then,0
And even as I was then is Percy now.,0
He hath more worthy interest to the state,0
For of no right nor colour like to right,0
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,0
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on,0
What never-dying honour hath he got,0
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,0
And military title capital,0
Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes,0
Discomfited great Douglas ta'en him once,0
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,0
And what say you to this? Percy Northumberland,0
Capitulate against us and are up.,0
Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes,0
Thou that art like enough through vassal fear,0
To fight against me under Percy's pay,0
To show how much thou art degenerate.,0
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd,0
I will redeem all this on Percy's head,0
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;,0
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,0
And that shall be the day whene'er it lights,0
This gallant Hotspur this all-praised knight,0
For every honour sitting on his helm,0
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,0
His glorious deeds for my indignities.,0
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;,0
That he shall render every glory up,0
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.,0
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,0
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:,0
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths,0
A hundred thousand rebels die in this:,0
Enter BLUNT,0
So hath the business that I come to speak of.,0
That Douglas and the English rebels met,0
A mighty and a fearful head they are,0
As ever offer'd foul play in the state.,0
With him my son Lord John of Lancaster;,0
On Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward;,0
Is Bridgenorth: and Harry you shall march,0
Our business valued some twelve days hence,0
Our hands are full of business: let's away;,0
Exeunt,0
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH,0
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my,0
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,0
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly and then I,0
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of I,0
church! Company villanous company hath been the,0
Sir John you are so fretful you cannot live long.,0
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman,0
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once,0
borrowed three of four times; lived well and in,0
of all compass.,0
be out of all compass out of all reasonable,0
Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life:,0
the poop but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the,0
Why Sir John my face does you no harm.,0
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I,0
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his,0
given to virtue I would swear by thy face; my oath,0
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed but,0
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the,0
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,0
perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfire-light!,0
torches walking with thee in the night betwixt,0
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap,0
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any,0
it!,0
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.,0
How now Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired,0
Why Sir John what do you think Sir John? do you,0
I have inquired so has my husband man by man boy,0
was never lost in my house before.,0
a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go,0
Who I? no; I defy thee: God's light I was never,0
Go to I know you well enough.,0
you Sir John: you owe me money Sir John; and now,0
you a dozen of shirts to your back.,0
bakers' wives and they have made bolters of them.,0
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides Sir,0
you four and twenty pound.,0
He? alas he is poor; he hath nothing.,0
let them coin his nose let them coin his cheeks:,0
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I,0
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.,0
how oft that ring was copper!,0
he were here I would cudgel him like a dog if he,0
Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO marching and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life,0
must we all march?,0
My lord I pray you hear me.,0
husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.,0
Prithee let her alone and list to me.,0
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras,0
bawdy-house; they pick pockets.,0
Wilt thou believe me Hal? three or four bonds of,0
grandfather's.,0
So I told him my lord; and I said I heard your,0
of you like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said,0
What! he did not?,0
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed,0
fox; and for womanhood Maid Marian may be the,0
go,0
What thing! why a thing to thank God on.,0
shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,0
call me so.,0
otherwise.,0
What beast! why an otter.,0
Why she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not,0
Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any,0
Thou sayest true hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.,0
ought him a thousand pound.,0
A thousand pound Ha! a million: thy love is worth,0
Nay my lord he called you Jack and said he would,0
Did I Bardolph?,0
Yea if he said my ring was copper.,0
Why Hal thou knowest as thou art but man I dare:,0
roaring of a lion's whelp.,0
The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou,0
I do I pray God my girdle break.,0
knees! But sirrah there's no room for faith,0
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest,0
impudent embossed rascal if there were anything in,0
bawdy-houses and one poor penny-worth of,0
were enriched with any other injuries but these I,0
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?,0
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack,0
have more flesh than another man and therefore more,0
It appears so by the story.,0
love thy husband look to thy servants cherish thy,0
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,0
Exit Hostess,0
lad how is that answered?,0
thee: the money is paid back again.,0
I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.,0
do it with unwashed hands too.,0
I have procured thee Jack a charge of foot.,0
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief of the,0
heinously unprovided. Well God be thanked for,0
laud them I praise them.,0
My lord?,0
brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.,0
Go Peto to horse to horse; for thou and I have,0
Exit Peto,0
o'clock in the afternoon.,0
Money and order for their furniture.,0
And either we or they must lower lie.,0
Rare words! brave world! Hostess my breakfast come!,0
Exit,0
SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.,0
Well said my noble Scot: if speaking truth,0
Such attribution should the Douglas have,0
Should go so general current through the world.,0
The tongues of soothers; but a braver place,0
Nay task me to my word; approve me lord.,0
No man so potent breathes upon the ground,0
Do so and 'tis well.,0
What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.,0
Letters from him! why comes he not himself?,0
Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick,0
Under whose government come they along?,0
I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed?,0
And at the time of my departure thence,0
I would the state of time had first been whole,0
His health was never better worth than now.,0
The very life-blood of our enterprise;,0
He writes me here that inward sickness--,0
So soon be drawn nor did he think it meet,0
On any soul removed but on his own.,0
That with our small conjunction we should on,0
For as he writes there is no quailing now.,0
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?,0
A perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off:,0
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good,0
All at one cast? to set so rich a main,0
It were not good; for therein should we read,0
The very list the very utmost bound,0
Faith and so we should;,0
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what,0
A comfort of retirement lives in this.,0
If that the devil and mischance look big,0
But yet I would your father had been here.,0
Brooks no division: it will be thought,0
That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike,0
And think how such an apprehension,0
And breed a kind of question in our cause;,0
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,0
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:,0
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear,0
You strain too far.,0
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,0
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,0
To push against a kingdom with his help,0
Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole.,0
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.,0
My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul.,0
The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong,0
No harm: what more?,0
The king himself in person is set forth,0
With strong and mighty preparation.,0
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,0
And bid it pass?,0
All plumed like estridges that with the wind,0
Glittering in golden coats like images;,0
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;,0
I saw young Harry with his beaver on,0
Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,0
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,0
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.,0
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:,0
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war,0
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit,0
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,0
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt,0
Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse,0
O that Glendower were come!,0
I learn'd in Worcester as I rode along,0
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.,0
What may the king's whole battle reach unto?,0
Forty let it be:,0
The powers of us may serve so great a day,0
Doomsday is near; die all die merrily.,0
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.,0
SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.,0
Bardolph get thee before to Coventry; fill me a,0
we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.,0
Lay out lay out.,0
An if it do take it for thy labour; and if it make,0
my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.,0
Exit,0
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.,0
soldiers three hundred and odd pounds. I press me,0
me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked,0
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as,0
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such,0
bigger than pins' heads and they have bought out,0
ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of,0
painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his,0
discarded unjust serving-men younger sons to,0
trade-fallen the cankers of a calm world and a,0
an old faced ancient: and such have I to fill up,0
services that you would think that I had a hundred,0
swine-keeping from eating draff and husks. A mad,0
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye,0
Coventry with them that's flat: nay and the,0
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of,0
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked,0
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt to say,0
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all,0
Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND,0
What Hal! how now mad wag! what a devil dost thou,0
cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been,0
Faith Sir John'tis more than time that I were,0
The king I can tell you looks for us all: we must,0
Tut never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to,0
I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath,0
fellows are these that come after?,0
I did never see such pitiful rascals.,0
for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:,0
Ay but Sir John methinks they are exceeding poor,0
Faith for their poverty I know not where they had,0
learned that of me.,0
the ribs bare. But sirrah make haste: Percy is,0
What is the king encamped?,0
Well,0
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.,0
SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.,0
We'll fight with him to-night.,0
You give him then the advantage.,0
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?,0
His is certain ours is doubtful.,0
Do not my lord.,0
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.,0
And I dare well maintain it with my life,0
I hold as little counsel with weak fear,0
Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle,0
Yea or to-night.,0
To-night say I.,0
Being men of such great leading as you are,0
Drag back our expedition: certain horse,0
Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;,0
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,0
So are the horses of the enemy,0
The better part of ours are full of rest.,0
For God's sake. cousin stay till all come in.,0
Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT,0
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.,0
You were of our determination!,0
Envy your great deservings and good name,0
But stand against us like an enemy.,0
So long as out of limit and true rule,0
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know,0
You conjure from the breast of civil peace,0
Audacious cruelty. If that the king,0
Which he confesseth to be manifold,0
You shall have your desires with interest,0
Herein misled by your suggestion.,0
Knows at what time to promise when to pay.,0
Did give him that same royalty he wears;,0
Sick in the world's regard wretched and low,0
My father gave him welcome to the shore;,0
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,0
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,0
Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.,0
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,0
Met him in boroughs cities villages,0
Laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths,0
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.,0
Steps me a little higher than his vow,0
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;,0
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees,0
Cries out upon abuses seems to weep,0
This seeming brow of justice did he win,0
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads,0
In deputation left behind him here,0
Tut I came not to hear this.,0
In short time after he deposed the king;,0
And in the neck of that task'd the whole state:,0
Who is if every owner were well placed,0
There without ransom to lie forfeited;,0
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;,0
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;,0
And in conclusion drove us to seek out,0
Into his title the which we find,0
Shall I return this answer to the king?,0
Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd,0
And in the morning early shall my uncle,0
I would you would accept of grace and love.,0
Pray God you do.,0
SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.,0
Hie good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief,0
This to my cousin Scroop and all the rest,0
How much they do to import you would make haste.,0
I guess their tenor.,0
To-morrow good Sir Michael is a day,0
Must bide the touch; for sir at Shrewsbury,0
The king with mighty and quick-raised power,0
What with the sickness of Northumberland,0
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,0
And comes not in o'er-ruled by prophecies,0
To wage an instant trial with the king.,0
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.,0
But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy,0
Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen.,0
The special head of all the land together:,0
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;,0
Of estimation and command in arms.,0
I hope no less yet needful 'tis to fear;,0
For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the king,0
For he hath heard of our confederacy,0
Therefore make haste. I must go write again,0
Exeunt,0
SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.,0
How bloodily the sun begins to peer,0
At his distemperature.,0
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,0
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.,0
For nothing can seem foul to those that win.,0
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON,0
That you and I should meet upon such terms,0
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,0
This is not well my lord this is not well.,0
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?,0
Where you did give a fair and natural light,0
A prodigy of fear and a portent,0
Hear me my liege:,0
To entertain the lag-end of my life,0
I have not sought the day of this dislike.,0
Rebellion lay in his way and he found it.,0
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks,0
And yet I must remember you my lord,0
For you my staff of office did I break,0
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand,0
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.,0
That brought you home and boldly did outdare,0
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,0
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,0
To this we swore our aid. But in short space,0
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,0
What with the injuries of a wanton time,0
And the contrarious winds that held the king,0
That all in England did repute him dead:,0
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd,0
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;,0
As that ungentle hull the cuckoo's bird,0
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk,0
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing,0
Out of sight and raise this present head;,0
As you yourself have forged against yourself,0
And violation of all faith and troth,0
These things indeed you have articulate,0
To face the garment of rebellion,0
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,0
Of hurlyburly innovation:,0
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;,0
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.,0
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,0
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world,0
This present enterprise set off his head,0
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,0
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.,0
I have a truant been to chivalry;,0
Yet this before my father's majesty--,0
Of his great name and estimation,0
Try fortune with him in a single fight.,0
Albeit considerations infinite,0
We love our people well; even those we love,0
And will they take the offer of our grace,0
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:,0
What he will do: but if he will not yield,0
And they shall do their office. So be gone;,0
We offer fair; take it advisedly.,0
It will not be accepted on my life:,0
Are confident against the world in arms.,0
For on their answer will we set on them:,0
Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF,0
me so; 'tis a point of friendship.,0
Say thy prayers and farewell.,0
Why thou owest God a death.,0
Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before,0
calls not on me? Well 'tis no matter; honour pricks,0
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or,0
Honour hath no skill in surgery then? no. What is,0
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?,0
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible then. Yea,0
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore,0
ends my catechism.,0
SCENE II. The rebel camp.,0
O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard,0
Twere best he did.,0
It is not possible it cannot be,0
He will suspect us still and find a time,0
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;,0
Who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up,0
Look how we can or sad or merrily,0
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,0
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;,0
And an adopted name of privilege,0
All his offences live upon my head,0
And his corruption being ta'en from us,0
Therefore good cousin let not Harry know,0
Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.,0
Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS,0
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.,0
The king will bid you battle presently.,0
Lord Douglas go you and tell him so.,0
Exit,0
Did you beg any? God forbid!,0
Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,0
He calls us rebels traitors; and will scourge,0
Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS,0
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,0
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.,0
And nephew challenged you to single fight.,0
And that no man might draw short breath today,0
How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?,0
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,0
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.,0
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,0
Making you ever better than his praise,0
And which became him like a prince indeed,0
And chid his truant youth with such a grace,0
Of teaching and of learning instantly.,0
If he outlive the envy of this day,0
So much misconstrued in his wantonness.,0
On his follies: never did I hear,0
But be he as he will yet once ere night,0
That he shall shrink under my courtesy.,0
Better consider what you have to do,0
Can lift your blood up with persuasion.,0
My lord here are letters for you.,0
O gentlemen the time of life is short!,0
If life did ride upon a dial's point,0
An if we live we live to tread on kings;,0
Now for our consciences the arms are fair,0
Enter another Messenger,0
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,0
Let each man do his best: and here draw I,0
With the best blood that I can meet withal,0
Now Esperance! Percy! and set on.,0
And by that music let us all embrace;,0
A second time do such a courtesy.,0
SCENE III. Plain between the camps.,0
What is thy name that in the battle thus,0
Upon my head?,0
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus,0
They tell thee true.,0
Thy likeness for instead of thee King Harry,0
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.,0
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge,0
They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR,0
never had triumph'd upon a Scot.,0
Where?,0
This Douglas? no: I know this face full well:,0
Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.,0
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:,0
The king hath many marching in his coats.,0
I'll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece,0
Up and away!,0
Exeunt,0
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London I fear,0
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour,0
lead and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I,0
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's,0
they are for the town's end to beg during life.,0
Enter PRINCE HENRY,0
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff,0
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,0
O Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile.,0
done this day. I have paid Percy I have made him sure.,0
lend me thy sword.,0
not my sword; but take my pistol if thou wilt.,0
Ay Hal; 'tis hot 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.,0
What is it a time to jest and dally now?,0
Well if Percy be alive I'll pierce him. If he do,0
willingly let him make a carbonado of me. I like,0
life: which if I can save so; if not honour comes,0
Exit FALSTAFF,0
Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER and EARL OF WESTMORELAND,0
Harry withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.,0
Not I my lord unless I did bleed too.,0
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.,0
My Lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tent.,0
Lead me my lord? I do not need your help:,0
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,0
and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!,0
Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.,0
By God thou hast deceived me Lancaster;,0
Before I loved thee as a brother John;,0
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point,0
Of such an ungrown warrior.,0
Lends mettle to us all!,0
Enter DOUGLAS,0
I am the Douglas fatal to all those,0
That counterfeit'st the person of a king?,0
So many of his shadows thou hast met,0
Seek Percy and thyself about the field:,0
I will assay thee: so defend thyself.,0
And yet in faith thou bear'st thee like a king:,0
And thus I win thee.,0
Hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like,0
Of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms:,0
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.,0
Cheerly my lord how fares your grace?,0
And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.,0
Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,0
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.,0
That ever said I hearken'd for your death.,0
The insulting hand of Douglas over you,0
As all the poisonous potions in the world,0
Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.,0
Enter HOTSPUR,0
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.,0
Why then I see,0
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not Percy,0
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;,0
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.,0
To end the one of us; and would to God,0
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;,0
I'll crop to make a garland for my head.,0
They fight,0
Well said Hal! to it Hal! Nay you shall find no,0
Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF  who falls down as if he were dead and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded and falls,0
I better brook the loss of brittle life,0
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:,0
And time that takes survey of all the world,0
But that the earthy and cold hand of death,0
And food for--,0
For worms brave Percy: fare thee well great heart!,0
When that this body did contain a spirit,0
But now two paces of the vilest earth,0
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.,0
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:,0
And even in thy behalf I'll thank myself,0
Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven!,0
But not remember'd in thy epitaph!,0
What old acquaintance! could not all this flesh,0
I could have better spared a better man:,0
If I were much in love with vanity!,0
Though many dearer in this bloody fray.,0
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.,0
[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,0
to-morrow. 'Sblood'twas time to counterfeit or,0
Counterfeit? I lie I am no counterfeit: to die,0
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:,0
liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and,0
valour is discretion; in the which better part I,0
gunpowder Percy though he be dead: how if he,0
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.,0
killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?,0
Therefore sirrah,0
with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me.,0
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER,0
Thy maiden sword.,0
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?,0
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art,0
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?,0
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.,0
be not Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack. There is Percy:,0
if your father will do me any honour so; if not let,0
earl or duke I can assure you.,0
Didst thou? Lord Lord how this world is given to,0
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and,0
believed so; if not let them that should reward,0
it upon my death I gave him this wound in the,0
zounds I would make him eat a piece of my sword.,0
This is the strangest fellow brother John.,0
For my part if a lie may do thee grace,0
A retreat is sounded,0
Come brother let us to the highest of the field,0
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER,0
rewards me God reward him! If I do grow great,0
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.,0
SCENE V. Another part of the field.,0
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.,0
Pardon and terms of love to all of you?,0
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?,0
A noble earl and many a creature else,0
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne,0
What I have done my safety urged me to;,0
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.,0
Other offenders we will pause upon.,0
How goes the field?,0
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,0
Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest;,0
That the pursuers took him. At my tent,0
I may dispose of him.,0
Then brother John of Lancaster to you,0
Go to the Douglas and deliver him,0
His valour shown upon our crests to-day,0
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.,0
Which I shall give away immediately.,0
You son John and my cousin Westmoreland,0
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,0
Myself and you son Harry will towards Wales,0
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,0
And since this business so fair is done,0
Exeunt,0
SCENE I. Westminster Abbey.,1
Hung be the heavens with black yield day to night!,1
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,1
That have consented unto Henry's death!,1
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.,1
Virtue he had deserving to command:,1
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;,1
More dazzled and drove back his enemies,1
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:,1
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?,1
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,1
We with our stately presence glorify,1
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap,1
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French,1
By magic verses have contrived his end?,1
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.,1
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.,1
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.,1
His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:,1
Whom like a school-boy you may over-awe.,1
Gloucester whate'er we like thou art protector,1
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,1
Name not religion for thou lovest the flesh,1
Except it be to pray against thy foes.,1
Let's to the altar: heralds wait on us:,1
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.,1
When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,1
And none but women left to wail the dead.,1
Prosper this realm keep it from civil broils,1
A far more glorious star thy soul will make,1
Enter a Messenger,1
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,1
Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans,1
What say'st thou man before dead Henry's corse?,1
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.,1
If Henry were recall'd to life again,1
How were they lost? what treachery was used?,1
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,1
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,1
One would have lingering wars with little cost;,1
A third thinks without expense at all,1
Awake awake English nobility!,1
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;,1
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,1
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.,1
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!,1
To weep their intermissive miseries.,1
Lords view these letters full of bad mischance.,1
Except some petty towns of no import:,1
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;,1
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.,1
O whither shall we fly from this reproach?,1
Bedford if thou be slack I'll fight it out.,1
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,1
Enter another Messenger,1
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,1
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.,1
What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?,1
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.,1
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,1
By three and twenty thousand of the French,1
No leisure had he to enrank his men;,1
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges,1
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.,1
Where valiant Talbot above human thought,1
Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him;,1
The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;,1
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit,1
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.,1
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:,1
With purpose to relieve and follow them,1
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;,1
A base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace,1
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength,1
Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,1
Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid,1
O no he lives; but is took prisoner,1
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.,1
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:,1
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.,1
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,1
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,1
So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;,1
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,1
Since they so few watch such a multitude.,1
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,1
I do remember it; and here take my leave,1
Exit,1
To view the artillery and munition;,1
Exit,1
Being ordain'd his special governor,1
Exit,1
Each hath his place and function to attend:,1
But long I will not be Jack out of office:,1
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.,1
SCENE II. France. Before Orleans.,1
Mars his true moving even as in the heavens,1
Late did he shine upon the English side;,1
What towns of any moment but we have?,1
Otherwhiles the famish'd English like pale ghosts,1
They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:,1
And have their provender tied to their mouths,1
Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?,1
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;,1
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.,1
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!,1
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.,1
Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES ALENCON and REIGNIER,1
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,1
Salisbury is a desperate homicide;,1
The other lords like lions wanting food,1
Froissart a countryman of ours records,1
During the time Edward the Third did reign.,1
For none but Samsons and Goliases,1
Lean raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose,1
Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,1
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth,1
I think by some odd gimmors or device,1
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.,1
Be it so.,1
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.,1
Methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd:,1
Be not dismay'd for succor is at hand:,1
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven,1
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.,1
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:,1
Speak shall I call her in? Believe my words,1
Go call her in.,1
But first to try her skill,1
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:,1
Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with JOAN LA PUCELLE,1
Reignier is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?,1
I know thee well though never seen before.,1
In private will I talk with thee apart.,1
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.,1
My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.,1
To shine on my contemptible estate:,1
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,1
And in a vision full of majesty,1
And free my country from calamity:,1
In complete glory she reveal'd herself;,1
With those clear rays which she infused on me,1
Ask me what question thou canst possible,1
My courage try by combat if thou darest,1
Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate,1
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:,1
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,1
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.,1
Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;,1
churchyard,1
Then come o' God's name; I fear no woman.,1
Here they fight and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes,1
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.,1
Whoe'er helps thee 'tis thou that must help me:,1
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.,1
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:,1
I must not yield to any rites of love,1
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,1
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.,1
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;,1
Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean?,1
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.,1
Shall we give over Orleans or no?,1
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.,1
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.,1
Expect Saint Martin's summer halcyon days,1
Glory is like a circle in the water,1
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.,1
Dispersed are the glories it included.,1
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.,1
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.,1
Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee.,1
How may I reverently worship thee enough?,1
Woman do what thou canst to save our honours;,1
Presently we'll try: come let's away about it:,1
Exeunt,1
Enter GLOUCESTER with his Serving-men in blue coats,1
Since Henry's death I fear there is conveyance.,1
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.,1
First Serving-Man It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.,1
First Serving-Man Villains answer you so the lord protector?,1
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.,1
There's none protector of the realm but I.,1
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?,1
What noise is this? what traitors have we here?,1
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.,1
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:,1
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.,1
Arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate,1
Thou art no friend to God or to the king:,1
Serving-Men Open the gates unto the lord protector,1
Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats,1
How now ambitious Humphry! what means this?,1
BISHOP,1
And not protector of the king or realm.,1
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;,1
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,1
BISHOP,1
This be Damascus be thou cursed Cain,1
I will not slay thee but I'll drive thee back:,1
I'll use to carry thee out of this place.,1
Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.,1
Draw men for all this privileged place;,1
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:,1
In spite of pope or dignities of church,1
BISHOP,1
Winchester goose I cry a rope! a rope!,1
Thee I'll chase hence thou wolf in sheep's array.,1
Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER's men and enter in the hurly- burly the Mayor of London and his Officers,1
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!,1
Here's Beaufort that regards nor God nor king,1
BISHOP,1
One that still motions war and never peace,1
That seeks to overthrow religion,1
And would have armour here out of the Tower,1
I will not answer thee with words but blows.,1
Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife,1
Come officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,1
All manner of men assembled here in arms this day,1
command you in his highness' name to repair to,1
handle or use any sword weapon or dagger,1
Cardinal I'll be no breaker of the law:,1
BISHOP,1
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.,1
This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.,1
BISHOP,1
For I intend to have it ere long.,1
See the coast clear'd and then we will depart.,1
I myself fight not once in forty year.,1
SCENE IV. Orleans.,1
Master-Gunner Sirrah thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,1
Father I know; and oft have shot at them,1
Master-Gunner But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:,1
Something I must do to procure me grace.,1
How the English in the suburbs close intrench'd,1
In yonder tower to overpeer the city,1
They may vex us with shot or with assault.,1
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;,1
If I could see them.,1
If thou spy'st any run and bring me word;,1
Exit,1
I'll never trouble you if I may spy them.,1
Enter on the turrets SALISBURY and TALBOT GLANSDALE GARGRAVE and others,1
How wert thou handled being prisoner?,1
Discourse I prithee on this turret's top.,1
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;,1
But with a baser man of arms by far,1
Which I disdaining scorn'd; and craved death,1
In fine redeem'd I was as I desired.,1
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,1
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.,1
In open market-place produced they me,1
Here said they is the terror of the French,1
Then broke I from the officers that led me,1
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:,1
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.,1
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,1
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:,1
That walked about me every minute-while;,1
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.,1
I grieve to hear what torments you endured,1
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:,1
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:,1
Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale,1
Where is best place to make our battery next.,1
And I here at the bulwark of the bridge.,1
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.,1
O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners!,1
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?,1
How farest thou mirror of all martial men?,1
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand,1
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;,1
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,1
Yet livest thou Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,1
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.,1
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!,1
Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life?,1
Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort;,1
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.,1
Remember to avenge me on the French.',1
Play on the lute beholding the towns burn:,1
Here an alarum and it thunders and lightens,1
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?,1
My lord my lord the French have gathered head:,1
A holy prophetess new risen up,1
Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans,1
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.,1
Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish,1
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.,1
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.,1
SCENE V. The same.,1
Where is my strength my valour and my force?,1
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.,1
Here here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;,1
Blood will I draw on thee thou art a witch,1
Come come 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.,1
Heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail?,1
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.,1
They fight again,1
I must go victual Orleans forthwith.,1
O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.,1
Help Salisbury to make his testament:,1
Exit,1
I know not where I am nor what I do;,1
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:,1
Are from their hives and houses driven away.,1
Now like to whelps we crying run away.,1
Hark countrymen! either renew the fight,1
Renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead:,1
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,1
Alarum. Here another skirmish,1
You all consented unto Salisbury's death,1
Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,1
O would I were to die with Salisbury!,1
Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat; flourish,1
Enter on the walls JOAN LA PUCELLE CHARLES REIGNIER ALENCON and Soldiers,1
Rescued is Orleans from the English,1
Divinest creature Astraea's daughter,1
Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens,1
France triumph in thy glorious prophetess!,1
More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.,1
Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires,1
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.,1
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.,1
For which I will divide my crown with her,1
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.,1
Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:,1
Her ashes in an urn more precious,1
Transported shall be at high festivals,1
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,1
Come in and let us banquet royally,1
Flourish. Exeunt,1
SCENE I. Before Orleans.,1
Sirs take your places and be vigilant:,1
Near to the walls by some apparent sign,1
Sergeant you shall.,1
Thus are poor servitors,1
Constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and cold.,1
Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy,1
Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,1
Having all day caroused and banqueted:,1
As fitting best to quittance their deceit,1
Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,1
To join with witches and the help of hell!,1
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?,1
A maid! and be so martial!,1
If underneath the standard of the French,1
Well let them practise and converse with spirits:,1
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.,1
Not all together: better far I guess,1
That if it chance the one of us do fail,1
Agreed: I'll to yond corner.,1
And here will Talbot mount or make his grave.,1
Of English Henry shall this night appear,1
Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!,1
The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter several ways the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON and REIGNIER half ready and half unready,1
Unready! ay and glad we 'scaped so well.,1
Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.,1
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise,1
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.,1
Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.,1
Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE,1
Didst thou at first to flatter us withal,1
That now our loss might be ten times so much?,1
At all times will you have my power alike?,1
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?,1
This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.,1
That being captain of the watch to-night,1
Had all your quarters been as safely kept,1
We had not been thus shamefully surprised.,1
And so was mine my lord.,1
Within her quarter and mine own precinct,1
About relieving of the sentinels:,1
Question my lords no further of the case,1
But weakly guarded where the breach was made.,1
To gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispersed,1
Alarum. Enter an English Soldier crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly leaving their clothes behind,1
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;,1
Using no other weapon but his name.,1
SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.,1
The day begins to break and night is fled,1
Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit.,1
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,1
The middle centre of this cursed town.,1
For every drop of blood was drawn from him,1
And that hereafter ages may behold,1
Within their chiefest temple I'll erect,1
Upon the which that every one may read,1
The treacherous manner of his mournful death,1
But lords in all our bloody massacre,1
His new-come champion virtuous Joan of Arc,1
Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began,1
They did amongst the troops of armed men,1
Myself as far as I could well discern,1
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,1
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves,1
After that things are set in order here,1
Enter a Messenger,1
Call ye the warlike Talbot for his acts,1
Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?,1
With modesty admiring thy renown,1
To visit her poor castle where she lies,1
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.,1
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,1
You may not my lord despise her gentle suit.,1
Could not prevail with all their oratory,1
And therefore tell her I return great thanks,1
Will not your honours bear me company?,1
And I have heard it said unbidden guests,1
Well then alone since there's no remedy,1
Come hither captain.,1
You perceive my mind?,1
Exeunt,1
Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter,1
Porter remember what I gave in charge;,1
Madam I will.,1
COUNTESS,1
I shall as famous be by this exploit,1
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,1
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,1
Enter Messenger and TALBOT,1
According as your ladyship desired,1
COUNTESS,1
Madam it is.,1
Is this the scourge of France?,1
That with his name the mothers still their babes?,1
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,1
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.,1
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp,1
Madam I have been bold to trouble you;,1
I'll sort some other time to visit you.,1
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.,1
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.,1
I go to certify her Talbot's here.,1
COUNTESS,1
Prisoner! to whom?,1
To me blood-thirsty lord;,1
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,1
But now the substance shall endure the like,1
That hast by tyranny these many years,1
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.,1
COUNTESS,1
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond,1
Whereon to practise your severity.,1
Why art not thou the man?,1
COUNTESS,1
No no I am but shadow of myself:,1
For what you see is but the smallest part,1
I tell you madam were the whole frame here,1
Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.,1
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;,1
How can these contrarieties agree?,1
Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers,1
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?,1
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,1
And in a moment makes them desolate.,1
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:,1
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.,1
For I am sorry that with reverence,1
Be not dismay'd fair lady; nor misconstrue,1
The outward composition of his body.,1
Nor other satisfaction do I crave,1
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;,1
COUNTESS,1
To feast so great a warrior in my house.,1
SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden.,1
RICHARD,1
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?,1
The garden here is more convenient.,1
Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;,1
Faith I have been a truant in the law,1
And therefore frame the law unto my will.,1
Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch;,1
Between two blades which bears the better temper:,1
Between two girls which hath the merriest eye;,1
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,1
RICHARD,1
The truth appears so naked on my side,1
And on my side it is so well apparell'd,1
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.,1
Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,1
Let him that is a true-born gentleman,1
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,1
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,1
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.,1
Of base insinuating flattery,1
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,1
Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more,1
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree,1
Good Master Vernon it is well objected:,1
RICHARD,1
Then for the truth and plainness of the case.,1
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.,1
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red,1
If I my lord for my opinion bleed,1
And keep me on the side where still I am.,1
Unless my study and my books be false,1
To SOMERSET,1
RICHARD,1
Here in my scabbard meditating that,1
RICHARD,1
For pale they look with fear as witnessing,1
No Plantagenet,1
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,1
RICHARD,1
Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet?,1
Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth;,1
Well I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,1
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.,1
Now by this maiden blossom in my hand,1
Turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet.,1
Proud Pole I will and scorn both him and thee.,1
Away away good William de la Pole!,1
Now by God's will thou wrong'st him Somerset;,1
Third son to the third Edward King of England:,1
RICHARD,1
Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.,1
On any plot of ground in Christendom.,1
For treason executed in our late king's days?,1
Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry?,1
And till thou be restored thou art a yeoman.,1
My father was attached not attainted,1
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,1
For your partaker Pole and you yourself,1
To scourge you for this apprehension:,1
Ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still;,1
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.,1
And by my soul this pale and angry rose,1
Will I for ever and my faction wear,1
Or flourish to the height of my degree.,1
And so farewell until I meet thee next.,1
Have with thee Pole. Farewell ambitious Richard.,1
RICHARD,1
This blot that they object against your house,1
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;,1
I will not live to be accounted Warwick.,1
Against proud Somerset and William Pole,1
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,1
Shall send between the red rose and the white,1
RICHARD,1
That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.,1
And so will I.,1
Thanks gentle sir.,1
This quarrel will drink blood another day.,1
SCENE V. The Tower of London.,1
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,1
Even like a man new haled from the rack,1
And these grey locks the pursuivants of death,1
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.,1
Wax dim as drawing to their exigent;,1
And pithless arms like to a wither'd vine,1
Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb,1
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,1
But tell me keeper will my nephew come?,1
We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber;,1
Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.,1
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,1
This loathsome sequestration have I had:,1
Deprived of honour and inheritance.,1
Just death kind umpire of men's miseries,1
I would his troubles likewise were expired,1
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET,1
Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come?,1
Ay noble uncle thus ignobly used,1
Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,1
O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,1
And now declare sweet stem from York's great stock,1
RICHARD,1
And in that ease I'll tell thee my disease.,1
Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;,1
And did upbraid me with my father's death:,1
Else with the like I had requited him.,1
In honour of a true Plantagenet,1
My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head.,1
And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth,1
Was cursed instrument of his decease.,1
Discover more at large what cause that was,1
I will if that my fading breath permit,1
Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king,1
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,1
During whose reign the Percies of the north,1
Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:,1
Was for that--young King Richard thus removed,1
I was the next by birth and parentage;,1
From Lionel Duke of Clarence the third son,1
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,1
But mark: as in this haughty attempt,1
I lost my liberty and they their lives.,1
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign,1
From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York,1
Again in pity of my hard distress,1
And have install'd me in the diadem:,1
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,1
RICHARD,1
True; and thou seest that I no issue have,1
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:,1
RICHARD,1
But yet methinks my father's execution,1
With silence nephew be thou politic:,1
And like a mountain not to be removed.,1
As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd,1
RICHARD,1
Might but redeem the passage of your age!,1
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.,1
Only give order for my funeral:,1
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!,1
RICHARD,1
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,1
Well I will lock his counsel in my breast;,1
Keepers convey him hence and I myself,1
Exeunt Gaolers bearing out the body of MORTIMER,1
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:,1
Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:,1
And therefore haste I to the parliament,1
Or make my ill the advantage of my good.,1
ACT III,1
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI EXETER GLOUCESTER  WARWICK SOMERSET and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER RICHARD PLANTAGENET and others.  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it and tears it,1
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,1
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,1
Do it without invention suddenly;,1
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.,1
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.,1
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,1
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:,1
Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks,1
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,1
Lascivious wanton more than well beseems,1
And for thy treachery what's more manifest?,1
As well at London bridge as at the Tower.,1
The king thy sovereign is not quite exempt,1
BISHOP,1
To give me hearing what I shall reply.,1
As he will have me how am I so poor?,1
Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling?,1
More than I do?--except I be provoked.,1
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:,1
No one but he should be about the king;,1
And makes him roar these accusations forth.,1
As good!,1
BISHOP,1
But one imperious in another's throne?,1
BISHOP,1
Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps,1
BISHOP,1
Thou art reverent,1
BISHOP,1
Roam thither then.,1
Ay see the bishop be not overborne.,1
And know the office that belongs to such.,1
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.,1
State holy or unhallow'd what of that?,1
RICHARD,1
Lest it be said 'Speak sirrah when you should;,1
Else would I have a fling at Winchester.,1
The special watchmen of our English weal,1
To join your hearts in love and amity.,1
That two such noble peers as ye should jar!,1
Civil dissension is a viperous worm,1
A noise within 'Down with the tawny-coats!',1
An uproar I dare warrant,1
A noise again 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor,1
Pity the city of London pity us!,1
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,1
And banding themselves in contrary parts,1
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:,1
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.,1
We charge you on allegiance to ourself,1
Pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife.,1
We'll fall to it with our teeth.,1
Skirmish again,1
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.,1
Just and upright; and for your royal birth,1
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,1
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,1
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.,1
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.,1
Stay stay I say!,1
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.,1
Can you my Lord of Winchester behold,1
Who should be pitiful if you be not?,1
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?,1
Except you mean with obstinate repulse,1
You see what mischief and what murder too,1
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.,1
He shall submit or I will never yield.,1
Or I would see his heart out ere the priest,1
Behold my Lord of Winchester the duke,1
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:,1
Here Winchester I offer thee my hand.,1
That malice was a great and grievous sin;,1
But prove a chief offender in the same?,1
For shame my lord of Winchester relent!,1
BISHOP,1
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.,1
See here my friends and loving countrymen,1
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:,1
BISHOP,1
O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester,1
Away my masters! trouble us no more;,1
First Serving-man Content: I'll to the surgeon's.,1
Third Serving-man And I will see what physic the tavern affords.,1
Accept this scroll most gracious sovereign,1
We do exhibit to your majesty.,1
And if your grace mark every circumstance,1
Especially for those occasions,1
And those occasions uncle were of force:,1
That Richard be restored to his blood.,1
So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.,1
As will the rest so willeth Winchester.,1
But all the whole inheritance I give,1
From whence you spring by lineal descent.,1
Thy humble servant vows obedience,1
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;,1
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:,1
And rise created princely Duke of York.,1
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!,1
That grudge one thought against your majesty!,1
[Aside]  Perish base prince ignoble Duke of York!,1
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:,1
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,1
When Gloucester says the word King Henry goes;,1
Your ships already are in readiness.,1
Ay we may march in England or in France,1
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers,1
And will at last break out into a flame:,1
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,1
And now I fear that fatal prophecy,1
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;,1
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:,1
His days may finish ere that hapless time.,1
SCENE II. France. Before Rouen.,1
These are the city gates the gates of Rouen,1
Take heed be wary how you place your words;,1
That come to gather money for their corn.,1
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,1
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.,1
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;,1
Knocks,1
Paysans pauvres gens de France;,1
Enter go in; the market bell is rung.,1
Exeunt,1
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!,1
Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;,1
Where is the best and safest passage in?,1
Which once discern'd shows that her meaning is,1
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top thrusting out a torch burning,1
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,1
Exit,1
The burning torch in yonder turret stands.,1
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!,1
Enter and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,1
Alarum. Exeunt,1
France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,1
Pucelle that witch that damned sorceress,1
That hardly we escaped the pride of France.,1
An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD brought in sick  in a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:  within JOAN LA PUCELLE CHARLES BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON and REIGNIER on the walls,1
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast,1
Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?,1
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,1
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.,1
What will you do good grey-beard? break a lance,1
Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,1
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age,1
Damsel I'll have a bout with you again,1
Are ye so hot sir? yet Pucelle hold thy peace;,1
The English whisper together in council,1
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?,1
To try if that our own be ours or no.,1
But unto thee Alencon and the rest;,1
Signior no.,1
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls,1
Away captains! let's get us from the walls;,1
God be wi' you my lord! we came but to tell you,1
Exeunt from the walls,1
Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!,1
Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,1
And I as sure as English Henry lives,1
As sure as in this late-betrayed town,1
So sure I swear to get the town or die.,1
But ere we go regard this dying prince,1
We will bestow you in some better place,1
Lord Talbot do not so dishonour me:,1
And will be partner of your weal or woe.,1
Not to be gone from hence; for once I read,1
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:,1
Because I ever found them as myself.,1
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!,1
But gather we our forces out of hand,1
Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants,1
Whither away Sir John Fastolfe in such haste?,1
We are like to have the overthrow again.,1
Ay,1
Exit,1
Exit,1
Now quiet soul depart when heaven please,1
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?,1
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.,1
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT BURGUNDY and the rest,1
This is a double honour Burgundy:,1
Warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy,1
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.,1
I think her old familiar is asleep:,1
What all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief,1
Now will we take some order in the town,1
And then depart to Paris to the king,1
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.,1
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,1
A braver soldier never couched lance,1
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,1
Exeunt,1
Enter CHARLES the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON JOAN LA PUCELLE and forces,1
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:,1
For things that are not to be remedied.,1
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;,1
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.,1
And of thy cunning had no diffidence:,1
Search out thy wit for secret policies,1
We'll set thy statue in some holy place,1
Employ thee then sweet virgin for our good.,1
By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words,1
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.,1
France were no place for Henry's warriors;,1
But be extirped from our provinces.,1
And not have title of an earldom here.,1
To bring this matter to the wished end.,1
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive,1
Here sound an English march. Enter and pass over at a distance TALBOT and his forces,1
And all the troops of English after him.,1
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:,1
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.,1
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!,1
The princely Charles of France thy countryman.,1
Speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words.,1
Stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.,1
Look on thy country look on fertile France,1
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.,1
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,1
Behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds,1
O turn thy edged sword another way;,1
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom,1
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,1
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,1
Besides all French and France exclaims on thee,1
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation,1
When Talbot hath set footing once in France,1
Who then but English Henry will be lord,1
Call we to mind and mark but this for proof,1
And was he not in England prisoner?,1
They set him free without his ransom paid,1
See then thou fight'st against thy countrymen,1
Come come return; return thou wandering lord:,1
I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers,1
And made me almost yield upon my knees.,1
And lords accept this hearty kind embrace:,1
So farewell Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.,1
Welcome brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.,1
Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,1
Now let us on my lords and join our powers,1
Exeunt,1
Enter KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER YORK SUFFOLK SOMERSET WARWICK  EXETER VERNON BASSET and others. To them with his Soldiers TALBOT,1
Hearing of your arrival in this realm,1
To do my duty to my sovereign:,1
To your obedience fifty fortresses,1
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,1
And with submissive loyalty of heart,1
First to my God and next unto your grace.,1
Is this the Lord Talbot uncle Gloucester,1
Yes if it please your majesty my liege.,1
When I was young as yet I am not old,1
A stouter champion never handled sword.,1
Your faithful service and your toil in war;,1
Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,1
Therefore stand up; and for these good deserts,1
And in our coronation take your place.,1
Now sir to you that were so hot at sea,1
In honour of my noble Lord of York:,1
Yes sir; as well as you dare patronage,1
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.,1
Why what is he? as good a man as York.,1
Strikes him,1
That whoso draws a sword 'tis present death,1
But I'll unto his majesty and crave,1
When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.,1
And after meet you sooner than you would.,1
ACT IV,1
Enter KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER YORK SUFFOLK SOMERSET WARWICK TALBOT EXETER the Governor of Paris and others,1
BISHOP,1
Now governor of Paris take your oath,1
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,1
Malicious practises against his state:,1
Enter FASTOLFE,1
To haste unto your coronation,1
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.,1
I vow'd base knight when I did meet thee next,1
Plucking it off,1
Thou wast installed in that high degree.,1
This dastard at the battle of Patay,1
And that the French were almost ten to one,1
Like to a trusty squire did run away:,1
Myself and divers gentlemen beside,1
Then judge great lords if I have done amiss;,1
This ornament of knighthood yea or no.,1
And ill beseeming any common man,1
When first this order was ordain'd my lords,1
Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage,1
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,1
He then that is not furnish'd in this sort,1
Profaning this most honourable order,1
Be quite degraded like a hedge-born swain,1
Stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom!,1
Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.,1
And now my lord protector view the letter,1
What means his grace that he hath changed his style?,1
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?,1
Pretend some alteration in good will?,1
Reads,1
Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,1
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,1
And join'd with Charles the rightful King of France.',1
That in alliance amity and oaths,1
What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?,1
Is that the worst this letter doth contain?,1
Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him,1
How say you my lord? are you not content?,1
I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.,1
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason,1
I go my lord in heart desiring still,1
Exit,1
Grant me the combat gracious sovereign.,1
This is my servant: hear him noble prince.,1
Be patient lords; and give them leave to speak.,1
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?,1
And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.,1
First let me know and then I'll answer you.,1
This fellow here with envious carping tongue,1
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves,1
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth,1
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;,1
In confutation of which rude reproach,1
I crave the benefit of law of arms.,1
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit,1
Yet know my lord I was provoked by him;,1
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower,1
Will not this malice Somerset be left?,1
Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.,1
When for so slight and frivolous a cause,1
Good cousins both of York and Somerset,1
Let this dissension first be tried by fight,1
The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;,1
There is my pledge; accept it Somerset.,1
Confirm it so mine honourable lord.,1
And perish ye with your audacious prate!,1
With this immodest clamorous outrage,1
And you my lords methinks you do not well,1
Much less to take occasion from their mouths,1
Let me persuade you take a better course.,1
Come hither you that would be combatants:,1
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.,1
In France amongst a fickle wavering nation:,1
And that within ourselves we disagree,1
To wilful disobedience and rebel!,1
When foreign princes shall be certified,1
King Henry's peers and chief nobility,1
O think upon the conquest of my father,1
That for a trifle that was bought with blood,1
I see no reason if I wear this rose,1
That any one should therefore be suspicious,1
Both are my kinsmen and I love them both:,1
Because forsooth the king of Scots is crown'd.,1
Than I am able to instruct or teach:,1
So let us still continue peace and love.,1
To be our regent in these parts of France:,1
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;,1
Go cheerfully together and digest.,1
Ourself my lord protector and the rest,1
From thence to England; where I hope ere long,1
With Charles Alencon and that traitorous rout.,1
My Lord of York I promise you the king,1
And so he did; but yet I like it not,1
Tush that was but his fancy blame him not;,1
An if I wist he did--but let it rest;,1
Exeunt all but EXETER,1
For had the passions of thy heart burst out,1
More rancorous spite more furious raging broils,1
But howsoe'er no simple man that sees,1
This shouldering of each other in the court,1
But that it doth presage some ill event.,1
But more when envy breeds unkind division;,1
Exit,1
Enter TALBOT with trump and drum,1
Summon their general unto the wall.,1
English John Talbot captains calls you forth,1
And thus he would: Open your city gates;,1
And do him homage as obedient subjects;,1
But if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,1
Lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire;,1
Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,1
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,1
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.,1
For I protest we are well fortified,1
If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed,1
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,1
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,1
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.,1
To rive their dangerous artillery,1
Lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man,1
This is the latest glory of thy praise,1
For ere the glass that now begins to run,1
These eyes that see thee now well coloured,1
Drum afar off,1
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;,1
Exeunt General  and c,1
Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings.,1
How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,1
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!,1
Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch,1
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel,1
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,1
God and Saint George Talbot and England's right,1
Exeunt,1
Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers,1
That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?,1
That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,1
By your espials were discovered,1
Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.,1
That thus delays my promised supply,1
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,1
And cannot help the noble chevalier:,1
If he miscarry farewell wars in France.,1
Thou princely leader of our English strength,1
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,1
And hemm'd about with grim destruction:,1
Else farewell Talbot France and England's honour.,1
Doth stop my cornets were in Talbot's place!,1
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.,1
That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep.,1
He dies we lose; I break my warlike word;,1
All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.,1
And on his son young John who two hours since,1
This seven years did not Talbot see his son;,1
Alas what joy shall noble Talbot have,1
Away! vexation almost stops my breath,1
Lucy farewell; no more my fortune can,1
Maine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won away,1
Exit with his soldiers,1
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,1
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,1
Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,1
Exit,1
Enter SOMERSET with his army; a Captain of TALBOT's with him,1
This expedition was by York and Talbot,1
Might with a sally of the very town,1
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour,1
York set him on to fight and die in shame,1
Here is Sir William Lucy who with me,1
Enter Sir William LUCY,1
Whither my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;,1
Cries out for noble York and Somerset,1
And whiles the honourable captain there,1
And in advantage lingering looks for rescue,1
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.,1
The levied succors that should lend him aid,1
Yields up his life unto a world of odds:,1
Alencon Reignier compass him about,1
York set him on; York should have sent him aid.,1
Swearing that you withhold his levied host,1
York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;,1
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.,1
Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:,1
But dies betray'd to fortune by your strife.,1
Within six hours they will be at his aid.,1
For fly he could not if he would have fled;,1
If he be dead brave Talbot then adieu!,1
Exeunt,1
Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son,1
To tutor thee in stratagems of war,1
When sapless age and weak unable limbs,1
But O malignant and ill-boding stars!,1
A terrible and unavoided danger:,1
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape,1
Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?,1
Dishonour not her honourable name,1
The world will say he is not Talbot's blood,1
Fly to revenge my death if I be slain.,1
If we both stay we both are sure to die.,1
Your loss is great so your regard should be;,1
Upon my death the French can little boast;,1
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;,1
You fled for vantage everyone will swear;,1
There is no hope that ever I will stay,1
Here on my knee I beg mortality,1
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?,1
Upon my blessing I command thee go.,1
Part of thy father may be saved in thee.,1
Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it.,1
Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.,1
If death be so apparent then both fly.,1
My age was never tainted with such shame.,1
No more can I be sever'd from your side,1
Stay go do what you will the like do I;,1
Then here I take my leave of thee fair son,1
Come side by side together live and die.,1
Exeunt,1
Alarum: excursions wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about and TALBOT rescues him,1
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word,1
Where is John Talbot? Pause and take thy breath;,1
O twice my father twice am I thy son!,1
Till with thy warlike sword despite of late,1
When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,1
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,1
Beat down Alencon Orleans Burgundy,1
The ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood,1
Of thy first fight I soon encountered,1
Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace,1
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,1
Which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy:',1
Came in strong rescue. Speak thy father's care,1
Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly,1
Fly to revenge my death when I am dead:,1
O too much folly is it well I wot,1
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,1
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;,1
In thee thy mother dies our household's name,1
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;,1
The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;,1
On that advantage bought with such a shame,1
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,1
And like me to the peasant boys of France,1
Surely by all the glory you have won,1
Then talk no more of flight it is no boot;,1
Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,1
If thou wilt fight fight by thy father's side;,1
Exeunt,1
Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant,1
O where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?,1
Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:,1
His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,1
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;,1
Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,1
Suddenly made him from my side to start,1
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench,1
My Icarus my blossom in his pride.,1
Enter Soldiers with the body of JOHN TALBOT,1
Anon from thy insulting tyranny,1
Two Talbots winged through the lither sky,1
O thou whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,1
Brave death by speaking whether he will or no;,1
Poor boy! he smiles methinks as who should say,1
Come come and lay him in his father's arms:,1
Soldiers adieu! I have what I would have,1
Dies,1
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,1
How the young whelp of Talbot's raging-wood,1
Once I encounter'd him and thus I said:,1
But with a proud majestical high scorn,1
To be the pillage of a giglot wench:',1
He left me proudly as unworthy fight.,1
See where he lies inhearsed in the arms,1
Hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder,1
O no forbear! for that which we have fled,1
Enter Sir William LUCY attended; Herald of the French preceding,1
To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.,1
Submission Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;,1
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en,1
For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.,1
But where's the great Alcides of the field,1
Created for his rare success in arms,1
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,1
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield,1
Knight of the noble order of Saint George,1
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth,1
Here is a silly stately style indeed!,1
Writes not so tedious a style as this.,1
Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.,1
Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?,1
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!,1
It were enough to fright the realm of France:,1
It would amaze the proudest of you all.,1
And give them burial as beseems their worth.,1
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.,1
They would but stink and putrefy the air.,1
I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd,1
So we be rid of them do with 'em what thou wilt.,1
All will be ours now bloody Talbot's slain.,1
ACT V,1
Sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER and EXETER,1
The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?,1
They humbly sue unto your excellence,1
Between the realms of England and of France.,1
Well my good lord; and as the only means,1
And 'stablish quietness on every side.,1
It was both impious and unnatural,1
Should reign among professors of one faith.,1
And surer bind this knot of amity,1
A man of great authority in France,1
In marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry.,1
And fitter is my study and my books,1
Yet call the ambassador; and as you please,1
I shall be well content with any choice,1
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit a Legate and two Ambassadors,1
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?,1
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,1
He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.',1
Have been consider'd and debated on.,1
To draw conditions of a friendly peace;,1
Shall be transported presently to France.,1
I have inform'd his highness so at large,1
Her beauty and the value of her dower,1
In argument and proof of which contract,1
And so my lord protector see them guarded,1
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.,1
CARDINAL,1
The sum of money which I promised,1
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.,1
CARDINAL,1
Or be inferior to the proudest peer.,1
That neither in birth or for authority,1
I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,1
Exeunt,1
Enter CHARLES BURGUNDY ALENCON BASTARD OF ORLEANS REIGNIER JOAN LA PUCELLE and forces,1
Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt,1
Then march to Paris royal Charles of France,1
Peace be amongst them if they turn to us;,1
Enter Scout,1
And happiness to his accomplices!,1
The English army that divided was,1
And means to give you battle presently.,1
But we will presently provide for them.,1
Now he is gone my lord you need not fear.,1
Command the conquest Charles it shall be thine,1
Then on my lords; and France be fortunate!,1
SCENE III. Before Angiers.,1
The regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly.,1
And ye choice spirits that admonish me,1
Thunder,1
Under the lordly monarch of the north,1
Enter Fiends,1
Of your accustom'd diligence to me.,1
Out of the powerful regions under earth,1
They walk and speak not,1
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,1
In earnest of further benefit,1
They hang their heads,1
Pay recompense if you will grant my suit.,1
Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice,1
Then take my soul my body soul and all,1
They depart,1
That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest,1
My ancient incantations are too weak,1
Now France thy glory droopeth to the dust.,1
Excursions. Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE fighting hand  to hand with YORK. JOAN LA PUCELLE is taken. The French fly.,1
Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms,1
A goodly prize fit for the devil's grace!,1
As if with Circe she would change my shape!,1
O Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;,1
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!,1
By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds!,1
I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.,1
Exeunt,1
Be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner.,1
O fairest beauty do not fear nor fly!,1
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,1
Who art thou? say that I may honour thee.,1
The King of Naples whosoe'er thou art.,1
Be not offended nature's miracle,1
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,1
Yet if this servile usage once offend.,1
She is going,1
My hand would free her but my heart says no,1
Twinkling another counterfeited beam,1
Fain would I woo her yet I dare not speak:,1
Fie de la Pole! disable not thyself;,1
Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?,1
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.,1
What ransom must I pay before I pass?,1
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,1
Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?,1
She is a woman therefore to be won.,1
Fond man remember that thou hast a wife;,1
I were best to leave him for he will not hear.,1
He talks at random; sure the man is mad.,1
And yet I would that you would answer me.,1
Why for my king: tush that's a wooden thing!,1
Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,1
But there remains a scruple in that too;,1
Duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor,1
Hear ye captain are you not at leisure?,1
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.,1
What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,1
Lady vouchsafe to listen what I say.,1
And then I need not crave his courtesy.,1
Tush women have been captivate ere now.,1
I cry you mercy 'tis but Quid for Quo.,1
Your bondage happy to be made a queen?,1
Than is a slave in base servility;,1
And so shall you,1
Why what concerns his freedom unto me?,1
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand,1
If thou wilt condescend to be my--,1
His love.,1
No gentle madam; I unworthy am,1
And have no portion in the choice myself.,1
An if my father please I am content.,1
And madam at your father's castle walls,1
A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls,1
To whom?,1
Suffolk what remedy?,1
Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.,1
Consent and for thy honour give consent,1
Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;,1
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.,1
Fair Margaret knows,1
Upon thy princely warrant I descend,1
Exit from the walls,1
Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER below,1
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.,1
Fit to be made companion with a king:,1
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth,1
Upon condition I may quietly,1
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,1
That is her ransom; I deliver her;,1
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.,1
As deputy unto that gracious king,1
Reignier of France I give thee kingly thanks,1
Aside,1
To be mine own attorney in this case.,1
And make this marriage to be solemnized.,1
In golden palaces as it becomes.,1
The Christian prince King Henry were he here.,1
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.,1
Farewell sweet madam: but hark you Margaret;,1
Such commendations as becomes a maid,1
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.,1
No loving token to his majesty?,1
Never yet taint with love I send the king.,1
Kisses her,1
To send such peevish tokens to a king.,1
O wert thou for myself! But Suffolk stay;,1
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.,1
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,1
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,1
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.,1
SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.,1
Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.,1
Ah Joan this kills thy father's heart outright!,1
And now it is my chance to find thee out,1
Ah Joan sweet daughter Joan I'll die with thee!,1
I am descended of a gentler blood:,1
Out out! My lords an please you 'tis not so;,1
Her mother liveth yet can testify,1
Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?,1
Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.,1
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;,1
Deny me not I prithee gentle Joan.,1
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.,1
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.,1
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time,1
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,1
Or else when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,1
Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab?,1
Exit,1
To fill the world with vicious qualities.,1
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,1
Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,1
To work exceeding miracles on earth.,1
But you that are polluted with your lusts,1
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,1
You judge it straight a thing impossible,1
No misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been,1
Chaste and immaculate in very thought;,1
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.,1
And hark ye sirs; because she is a maid,1
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,1
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?,1
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.,1
Murder not then the fruit within my womb,1
Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!,1
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?,1
I did imagine what would be her refuge.,1
Especially since Charles must father it.,1
It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.,1
It dies an if it had a thousand lives.,1
Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,1
A married man! that's most intolerable.,1
There were so many whom she may accuse.,1
And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure.,1
Use no entreaty for it is in vain.,1
May never glorious sun reflex his beams,1
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death,1
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!,1
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,1
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER attended,1
Lord regent I do greet your excellence,1
For know my lords the states of Christendom,1
Have earnestly implored a general peace,1
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train,1
Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?,1
So many captains gentlemen and soldiers,1
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,1
Have we not lost most part of all the towns,1
Our great progenitors had conquered?,1
The utter loss of all the realm of France.,1
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants,1
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BASTARD OF ORLEANS REIGNIER and others,1
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,1
What the conditions of that league must be.,1
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,1
CARDINAL,1
That in regard King Henry gives consent,1
To ease your country of distressful war,1
You shall become true liegemen to his crown:,1
To pay him tribute submit thyself,1
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.,1
Adorn his temples with a coronet,1
Retain but privilege of a private man?,1
Tis known already that I am possess'd,1
And therein reverenced for their lawful king:,1
Detract so much from that prerogative,1
No lord ambassador I'll rather keep,1
Be cast from possibility of all.,1
Used intercession to obtain a league,1
Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?,1
Of benefit proceeding from our king,1
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.,1
To cavil in the course of this contract:,1
We shall not find like opportunity.,1
To save your subjects from such massacre,1
By our proceeding in hostility;,1
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.,1
It shall;,1
In any of our towns of garrison.,1
As thou art knight never to disobey,1
Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England.,1
Hang up your ensign let your drums be still,1
Exeunt,1
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER and EXETER,1
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:,1
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:,1
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,1
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive,1
Tush my good lord this superficial tale,1
The chief perfections of that lovely dame,1
Would make a volume of enticing lines,1
And which is more she is not so divine,1
But with as humble lowliness of mind,1
Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents,1
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.,1
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.,1
You know my lord your highness is betroth'd,1
How shall we then dispense with that contract,1
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;,1
To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists,1
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,1
Why what I pray is Margaret more than that?,1
Although in glorious titles he excel.,1
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;,1
As his alliance will confirm our peace,1
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,1
Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,1
A dower my lords! disgrace not so your king,1
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.,1
And not seek a queen to make him rich:,1
As market-men for oxen sheep or horse.,1
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;,1
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:,1
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,1
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,1
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,1
Whom should we match with Henry being a king,1
Her peerless feature joined with her birth,1
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,1
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;,1
Is likely to beget more conquerors,1
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.,1
That Margaret shall be queen and none but she.,1
My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that,1
With any passion of inflaming love,1
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,1
As I am sick with working of my thoughts.,1
Agree to any covenants and procure,1
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd,1
For your expenses and sufficient charge,1
Be gone I say; for till you do return,1
And you good uncle banish all offence:,1
Not what you are I know it will excuse,1
And so conduct me where from company,1
Exit,1
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER,1
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,1
But prosper better than the Trojan did.,1
But I will rule both her the king and realm.,1
ACT I,2
Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING  HENRY VI GLOUCESTER SALISBURY WARWICK and  CARDINAL on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET SUFFOLK YORK SOMERSET and BUCKINGHAM on the other,2
I had in charge at my depart for France,2
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,2
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,2
Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,2
And humbly now upon my bended knee,2
Deliver up my title in the queen,2
Of that great shadow I did represent;,2
The fairest queen that ever king received.,2
I can express no kinder sign of love,2
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!,2
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,2
Great King of England and my gracious lord,2
By day by night waking and in my dreams,2
With you mine alder-liefest sovereign,2
With ruder terms such as my wit affords,2
Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,2
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;,2
Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love.,2
happiness!,2
Flourish,2
Here are the articles of contracted peace,2
For eighteen months concluded by consent.,2
king Charles and William de la Pole Marquess of,2
the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,2
Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England ere the,2
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released,2
Lets the paper fall,2
Pardon me gracious lord;,2
And dimm'd mine eyes that I can read no further.,2
[Reads]  'Item It is further agreed between them,2
released and delivered over to the king her father,2
proper cost and charges without having any dowry.',2
We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,2
We here discharge your grace from being regent,2
Be full expired. Thanks uncle Winchester,2
Salisbury and Warwick;,2
In entertainment to my princely queen.,2
To see her coronation be perform'd.,2
Brave peers of England pillars of the state,2
Your grief the common grief of all the land.,2
His valour coin and people in the wars?,2
In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,2
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,2
Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham,2
Received deep scars in France and Normandy?,2
With all the learned council of the realm,2
Early and late debating to and fro,2
And had his highness in his infancy,2
And shall these labours and these honours die?,2
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?,2
Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame,2
Razing the characters of your renown,2
Undoing all as all had never been!,2
This peroration with such circumstance?,2
Ay uncle we will keep it if we can;,2
Suffolk the new-made duke that rules the roast,2
Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style,2
Now by the death of Him that died for all,2
But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son?,2
For were there hope to conquer them again,2
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;,2
And are the cities that I got with wounds,2
Mort Dieu!,2
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!,2
Before I would have yielded to this league.,2
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:,2
To match with her that brings no vantages.,2
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth,2
She should have stayed in France and starved,2
My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot:,2
My Lord of Winchester I know your mind;,2
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.,2
I see thy fury: if I longer stay,2
Lordings farewell; and say when I am gone,2
Exit,2
Tis known to you he is mine enemy,2
And no great friend I fear me to the king.,2
And heir apparent to the English crown:,2
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,2
Look to it lords! let not his smoothing words,2
What though the common people favour him,2
Gloucester',2
Jesu maintain your royal excellence!',2
I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss,2
Why should he then protect our sovereign,2
Cousin of Somerset join you with me,2
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.,2
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.,2
Cousin of Buckingham though Humphrey's pride,2
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:,2
Than all the princes in the land beside:,2
Or thou or I Somerset will be protector,2
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET,2
While these do labour for their own preferment,2
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester,2
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,2
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,2
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.,2
Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping,2
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:,2
In bringing them to civil discipline,2
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,2
Join we together for the public good,2
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,2
And as we may cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,2
So God help Warwick as he loves the land,2
[Aside]  And so says York for he hath greatest cause.,2
Unto the main! O father Maine is lost;,2
And would have kept so long as breath did last!,2
Which I will win from France or else be slain,2
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;,2
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone:,2
The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased,2
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?,2
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,2
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;,2
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands,2
While all is shared and all is borne away,2
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,2
Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland,2
As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd,2
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!,2
Even as I have of fertile England's soil.,2
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts,2
And when I spy advantage claim the crown,2
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,2
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,2
Then York be still awhile till time do serve:,2
To pry into the secrets of the state;,2
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,2
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,2
And in my standard bear the arms of York,2
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown,2
Exit,2
Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS,2
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?,2
As frowning at the favours of the world?,2
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?,2
Enchased with all the honours of the world?,2
Until thy head be circled with the same.,2
What is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:,2
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,2
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.,2
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.,2
Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry,2
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.,2
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.,2
Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,2
And on the pieces of the broken wand,2
And William de la Pole first duke of Suffolk.,2
Tut this was nothing but an argument,2
Shall lose his head for his presumption.,2
Methought I sat in seat of majesty,2
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;,2
And on my head did set the diadem.,2
Presumptuous dame ill-nurtured Eleanor,2
And the protector's wife beloved of him?,2
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?,2
To tumble down thy husband and thyself,2
Away from me and let me hear no more!,2
With Eleanor for telling but her dream?,2
And not be cheque'd.,2
Enter Messenger,2
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,2
I go. Come Nell thou wilt ride with us?,2
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger,2
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.,2
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks,2
And being a woman I will not be slack,2
Where are you there? Sir John! nay fear not man,2
Enter HUME,2
What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.,2
Your grace's title shall be multiplied.,2
With Margery Jourdain the cunning witch,2
And will they undertake to do me good?,2
A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,2
As by your grace shall be propounded him.,2
When from St. Alban's we do make return,2
Here Hume take this reward; make merry man,2
Exit,2
Marry and shall. But how now Sir John Hume!,2
The business asketh silent secrecy.,2
Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil.,2
I dare not say from the rich cardinal,2
Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,2
Have hired me to undermine the duchess,2
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;',2
Hume if you take not heed you shall go near,2
Well so it stands; and thus I fear at last,2
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:,2
Exit,2
Enter three or four Petitioners PETER the Armourer's man being one,2
will come this way by and by and then we may deliver,2
Marry the Lord protect him for he's a good man!,2
Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET,2
I'll be the first sure.,2
not my lord protector.,2
I pray my lord pardon me; I took ye for my lord,2
[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your,2
what is thine?,2
Goodman my lord cardinal's man for keeping my,2
Thy wife too! that's some wrong indeed. What's,2
Reads,2
commons of Melford.' How now sir knave!,2
[Giving his petition]  Against my master Thomas,2
heir to the crown.,2
rightful heir to the crown?,2
that he was and that the king was an usurper.,2
Enter Servant,2
his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear,2
Exit Servant with PETER,2
Under the wings of our protector's grace,2
Tears the supplication,2
Come let's be gone.,2
My Lord of Suffolk say is this the guise,2
Is this the government of Britain's isle,2
What shall King Henry be a pupil still,2
Am I a queen in title and in style,2
I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours,2
And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,2
In courage courtship and proportion:,2
To number Ave-Maries on his beads;,2
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,2
Are brazen images of canonized saints.,2
Would choose him pope and carry him to Rome,2
That were a state fit for his holiness.,2
Your highness came to England so will I,2
Beside the haughty protector have we Beaufort,2
And grumbling York: and not the least of these,2
And he of these that can do most of all,2
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.,2
As that proud dame the lord protector's wife.,2
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:,2
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,2
Shall I not live to be avenged on her?,2
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,2
Was better worth than all my father's lands,2
Madam myself have limed a bush for her,2
That she will light to listen to the lays,2
So let her rest: and madam list to me;,2
Although we fancy not the cardinal,2
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.,2
Will make but little for his benefit.,2
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.,2
For my part noble lords I care not which;,2
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,2
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,2
Whether your grace be worthy yea or no,2
Ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak.,2
All in this presence are thy betters Warwick.,2
Peace son! and show some reason Buckingham,2
Because the king forsooth will have it so.,2
To give his censure: these are no women's matters.,2
To be protector of his excellence?,2
And at his pleasure will resign my place.,2
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--,2
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;,2
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.,2
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.,2
Have cost a mass of public treasury.,2
Upon offenders hath exceeded law,2
They sale of offices and towns in France,2
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.,2
Give me my fan: what minion! can ye not?,2
I cry you mercy madam; was it you?,2
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,2
Sweet aunt be quiet; 'twas against her will.,2
She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby:,2
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.,2
Lord cardinal I will follow Eleanor,2
She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,2
Exit,2
Now lords my choler being over-blown,2
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.,2
Prove them and I lie open to the law:,2
As I in duty love my king and country!,2
I say my sovereign York is meetest man,2
Before we make election give me leave,2
That York is most unmeet of any man.,2
First for I cannot flatter thee in pride;,2
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,2
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:,2
Till Paris was besieged famish'd and lost.,2
Did never traitor in the land commit.,2
Image of pride why should I hold my peace?,2
Because here is a man accused of treason:,2
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?,2
Please it your majesty this is the man,2
His words were these: that Richard Duke of York,2
And that your majesty was a usurper.,2
An't shall please your majesty I never said nor,2
falsely accused by the villain.,2
me in the garret one night as we were scouring my,2
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,2
I do beseech your royal majesty,2
Alas my lord hang me if ever I spake the words.,2
him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his,2
witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,2
accusation.,2
This doom my lord if I may judge:,2
Because in York this breeds suspicion:,2
For single combat in convenient place,2
This is the law and this Duke Humphrey's doom.,2
And I accept the combat willingly.,2
my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O,2
fight a blow. O Lord my heart!,2
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat,2
Somerset we'll see thee sent away.,2
SCENE IV. GLOUCESTER's garden.,2
Come my masters; the duchess I tell you expects,2
Master Hume we are therefore provided: will her,2
Ay what else? fear you not her courage.,2
invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,2
busy below; and so I pray you go in God's name,2
Exit HUME,2
prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,2
Enter the DUCHESS aloft HUME following,2
gear the sooner the better.,2
Deep night dark night the silent of the night,2
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,2
That time best fits the work we have in hand.,2
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.,2
Adsum.,2
By the eternal God whose name and power,2
For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence.,2
First of the king: what shall of him become?',2
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;,2
As the Spirit speaks SOUTHWELL writes the answer,2
By water shall he die and take his end.,2
Let him shun castles;,2
Than where castles mounted stand.,2
Descend to darkness and the burning lake!,2
Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit,2
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.,2
What madam are you there? the king and commonweal,2
My lord protector will I doubt it not,2
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,2
True madam none at all: what call you this?,2
And kept asunder. You madam shall with us.,2
Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME guarded,2
All away!,2
Lord Buckingham methinks you watch'd her well:,2
Now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ.,2
Reads,2
But him outlive and die a violent death.',2
Aio te AEacida Romanos vincere posse.',2
Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?,2
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?,2
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains,2
Come come my lords;,2
And hardly understood.,2
With him the husband of this lovely lady:,2
carry them:,2
Your grace shall give me leave my Lord of York,2
At your pleasure my good lord. Who's within,2
Enter a Servingman,2
To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!,2
ACT II,2
Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET GLOUCESTER CARDINAL and SUFFOLK with Falconers halloing,2
I saw not better sport these seven years' day:,2
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out.,2
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!,2
Yea man and birds are fain of climbing high.,2
My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;,2
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.,2
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.,2
Ay my lord cardinal? how think you by that?,2
The treasury of everlasting joy.,2
Beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart;,2
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!,2
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?,2
With such holiness can you do it?,2
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.,2
Why as you my lord,2
Why Suffolk England knows thine insolence.,2
I prithee peace good queen,2
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.,2
Against this proud protector with my sword!,2
twere come to that!,2
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Make up no factious,2
In thine own person answer thy abuse.,2
not peep: an if thou darest,2
How now my lords!,2
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,2
Aside to GLOUCESTER,2
True uncle.,2
east side of the grove?,2
Why how now uncle Gloucester!,2
Aside to CARDINAL,2
Or all my fence shall fail.,2
Protector see to't well protect yourself.,2
How irksome is this music to my heart!,2
I pray my lords let me compound this strife.,2
What means this noise?,2
A miracle! a miracle!,2
Forsooth a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,2
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.,2
Gives light in darkness comfort in despair!,2
Here comes the townsmen on procession,2
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,2
Stand by my masters: bring him near the king;,2
Good fellow tell us here the circumstance,2
What hast thou been long blind and now restored?,2
Ay indeed was he.,2
His wife an't like your worship.,2
better told.,2
At Berwick in the north an't like your grace.,2
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,2
Tell me good fellow camest thou here by chance,2
God knows of pure devotion; being call'd,2
By good Saint Alban; who said 'Simpcox come,2
Most true forsooth; and many time and oft,2
What art thou lame?,2
How camest thou so?,2
A plum-tree master.,2
Born so master.,2
But that in all my life when I was a youth.,2
Mass thou lovedst plums well that wouldst,2
Alas  good master my wife desired some damsons,2
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.,2
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.,2
Saint Alban.,2
Red master; red as blood.,2
Black forsooth: coal-black as jet.,2
And yet I think jet did he never see.,2
Never before this day in all his life.,2
Alas master I know not.,2
I know not.,2
No indeed master.,2
Saunder Simpcox an if it please you master.,2
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind thou,2
name the several colours we do wear. Sight may,2
all it is impossible. My lords Saint Alban here,2
cunning to be great that could restore this cripple,2
O master that you could!,2
your town and things called whips?,2
Then send for one presently.,2
Exit an Attendant,2
if you mean to save yourself from whipping leap me,2
Alas master I am not able to stand alone:,2
Enter a Beadle with whips,2
beadle whip him till he leap over that same stool.,2
doublet quickly.,2
After the Beadle hath hit him once he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry 'A miracle!',2
It made me laugh to see the villain run.,2
Alas sir we did it for pure need.,2
they come to Berwick from whence they came.,2
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.,2
But you have done more miracles than I;,2
Enter BUCKINGHAM,2
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.,2
Under the countenance and confederacy,2
The ringleader and head of all this rout,2
Dealing with witches and with conjurers:,2
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,2
And other of your highness' privy-council;,2
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so my lord protector,2
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.,2
Tis like my lord you will not keep your hour.,2
Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;,2
Or to the meanest groom.,2
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!,2
And look thyself be faultless thou wert best.,2
How I have loved my king and commonweal:,2
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:,2
Honour and virtue and conversed with such,2
I banish her my bed and company,2
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.,2
To-morrow toward London back again,2
And call these foul offenders to their answers,2
Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails.,2
SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.,2
Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,2
In this close walk to satisfy myself,2
Which is infallible to England's crown.,2
Sweet York begin: and if thy claim be good,2
Then thus:,2
The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales;,2
Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom,2
The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York;,2
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.,2
And left behind him Richard his only son,2
Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster,2
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,2
Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came,2
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.,2
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.,2
For Richard the first son's heir being dead,2
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.,2
I claimed the crown had issue Philippe a daughter,2
Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March;,2
This Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke,2
And but for Owen Glendower had been king,2
But to the rest.,2
My mother being heir unto the crown,2
To Edmund Langley Edward the Third's fifth son.,2
To Roger Earl of March who was the son,2
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:,2
Succeed before the younger I am king.,2
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,2
Till Lionel's issue fails his should not reign:,2
And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock.,2
And in this private plot be we the first,2
With honour of his birthright to the crown.,2
We thank you lords. But I am not your king,2
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;,2
But with advice and silent secrecy.,2
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,2
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,2
That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey:,2
Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy.,2
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick,2
And Nevil this I do assure myself:,2
The greatest man in England but the king.,2
SCENE III. A hall of justice.,2
Stand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucester's wife:,2
Receive the sentence of the law for sins,2
You four from hence to prison back again;,2
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,2
You madam for you are more nobly born,2
Shall after three days' open penance done,2
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.,2
Eleanor the law thou see'st hath judged thee:,2
Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners guarded,2
Ah Humphrey this dishonour in thine age,2
I beseech your majesty give me leave to go;,2
Stay Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,2
Protector be; and God shall be my hope,2
And go in peace Humphrey no less beloved,2
I see no reason why a king of years,2
God and King Henry govern England's realm.,2
My staff? here noble Henry is my staff:,2
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;,2
As others would ambitiously receive it.,2
May honourable peace attend thy throne!,2
Why now is Henry king and Margaret queen;,2
That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;,2
This staff of honour raught there let it stand,2
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;,2
Lords let him go. Please it your majesty,2
And ready are the appellant and defendant,2
So please your highness to behold the fight.,2
Left I the court to see this quarrel tried.,2
Here let them end it; and God defend the right!,2
Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant,2
Enter at one door HORNER the Armourer and his  Neighbours drinking to him so much that he is drunk;  and he enters with a drum before him and his staff  with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the other  door PETER his man with a drum and sand-bag and 'Prentices drinking to him,2
sack: and fear not neighbour you shall do well enough.,2
And here's a pot of good double beer neighbour:,2
Let it come i' faith and I'll pledge you all; and,2
First 'Prentice Here Peter I drink to thee: and be not afraid.,2
for credit of the 'prentices.,2
you; for I think I have taken my last draught in,2
my apron: and Will thou shalt have my hammer:,2
Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to,2
Come leave your drinking and fall to blows.,2
Peter forsooth.,2
Thump.,2
Masters I am come hither as it were upon my man's,2
honest man: and touching the Duke of York I will,2
king nor the queen: and therefore Peter have at,2
Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.,2
Alarum. They fight and PETER strikes him down,2
Dies,2
good wine in thy master's way.,2
O Peter thou hast prevailed in right!,2
For his death we do perceive his guilt:,2
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,2
Come fellow follow us for thy reward.,2
SCENE IV. A street.,2
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;,2
Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold:,2
Sirs what's o'clock?,2
Ten is the hour that was appointed me,2
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,2
Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook,2
With envious looks laughing at thy shame,2
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.,2
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.,2
So please your grace we'll take her from the sheriff.,2
Come you my lord to see my open shame?,2
See how the giddy multitude do point,2
Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks,2
And ban thine enemies both mine and thine!,2
Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself!,2
And thou a prince protector of this land,2
Mail'd up in shame with papers on my back,2
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.,2
And when I start the envious people laugh,2
Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke?,2
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?,2
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.,2
And he a prince and ruler of the land:,2
As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess,2
To every idle rascal follower.,2
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death,2
For Suffolk he that can do all in all,2
And York and impious Beaufort that false priest,2
And fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee:,2
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.,2
I must offend before I be attainted;,2
And each of them had twenty times their power,2
So long as I am loyal true and crimeless.,2
Why yet thy scandal were not wiped away,2
Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell:,2
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.,2
I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,2
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!,2
Exit Herald,2
Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.,2
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now,2
Must you Sir John protect my lady here?,2
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray,2
And I may live to do you kindness if,2
What gone my lord and bid me not farewell!,2
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen,2
For none abides with me: my joy is death;,2
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.,2
I care not whither for I beg no favour,2
Why madam that is to the Isle of Man;,2
That's bad enough for I am but reproach:,2
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady;,2
Sheriff farewell and better than I fare,2
It is my office; and madam pardon me.,2
Come Stanley shall we go?,2
And go we to attire you for our journey.,2
No it will hang upon my richest robes,2
Go lead the way; I long to see my prison.,2
ACT III,2
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN  MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK YORK BUCKINGHAM SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament,2
Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,2
Can you not see? or will ye not observe,2
With what a majesty he bears himself,2
How proud how peremptory and unlike himself?,2
And if we did but glance a far-off look,2
That all the court admired him for submission:,2
When every one will give the time of day,2
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,2
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;,2
And Humphrey is no little man in England.,2
And should you fall he as the next will mount.,2
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,2
That he should come about your royal person,2
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,2
Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.,2
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden,2
The reverent care I bear unto my lord,2
If it be fond call it a woman's fear;,2
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.,2
Reprove my allegation if you can;,2
Well hath your highness seen into this duke;,2
I think I should have told your grace's tale.,2
Upon my life began her devilish practises:,2
Yet by reputing of his high descent,2
And such high vaunts of his nobility,2
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.,2
And in his simple show he harbours treason.,2
No no my sovereign; Gloucester is a man,2
Did he not contrary to form of law,2
And did he not in his protectorship,2
For soldiers' pay in France and never sent it?,2
Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown.,2
Duke Humphrey.,2
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,2
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent,2
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:,2
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.,2
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,2
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,2
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?,2
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.,2
All health unto my gracious sovereign!,2
That all your interest in those territories,2
Cold news Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!,2
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.,2
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;,2
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.,2
All happiness unto my lord the king!,2
Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon,2
I do arrest thee of high treason here.,2
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:,2
The purest spring is not so free from mud,2
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?,2
And being protector stayed the soldiers' pay;,2
Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?,2
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.,2
Ay night by night in studying good for England,2
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,2
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,2
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,2
It serves you well my lord to say so much.,2
In your protectorship you did devise,2
That England was defamed by tyranny.,2
protector,2
For I should melt at an offender's tears,2
Unless it were a bloody murderer,2
I never gave them condign punishment:,2
Above the felon or what trespass else.,2
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,2
I do arrest you in his highness' name;,2
To keep until your further time of trial.,2
That you will clear yourself from all suspect:,2
Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous:,2
And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;,2
And equity exiled your highness' land.,2
And if my death might make this island happy,2
I would expend it with all willingness:,2
For thousands more that yet suspect no peril,2
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,2
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue,2
And dogged York that reaches at the moon,2
By false accuse doth level at my life:,2
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,2
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:,2
Myself had notice of your conventicles--,2
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,2
The ancient proverb will be well effected:,2
My liege his railing is intolerable:,2
From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage,2
And the offender granted scope of speech,2
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here,2
As if she had suborned some to swear,2
But I can give the loser leave to chide.,2
Beshrew the winners for they play'd me false!,2
He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:,2
Sirs take away the duke and guard him sure.,2
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.,2
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.,2
For good King Henry thy decay I fear.,2
My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best,2
What will your highness leave the parliament?,2
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,2
For what's more miserable than discontent?,2
The map of honour truth and loyalty:,2
That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.,2
That these great lords and Margaret our queen,2
Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong;,2
And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays,2
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;,2
Looking the way her harmless young one went,2
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case,2
Look after him and cannot do him good,2
His fortunes I will weep; and 'twixt each groan,2
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart,2
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,2
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile,2
Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,2
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.,2
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--,2
To rid us of the fear we have of him.,2
But yet we want a colour for his death:,2
But in my mind that were no policy:,2
The commons haply rise to save his life;,2
More than mistrust that shows him worthy death.,2
Ah York no man alive so fain as I!,2
But my lord cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk,2
Were't not all one an empty eagle were set,2
As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?,2
Madam 'tis true; and were't not madness then,2
Who being accused a crafty murderer,2
Because his purpose is not executed.,2
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,2
As Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege.,2
Be it by gins by snares by subtlety,2
So he be dead; for that is good deceit,2
Thrice-noble Suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke.,2
For things are often spoke and seldom meant:,2
Seeing the deed is meritorious,2
Say but the word and I will be his priest.,2
Ere you can take due orders for a priest:,2
And I'll provide his executioner,2
Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing.,2
And I    and now we three have spoke it,2
Enter a Post,2
To signify that rebels there are up,2
Send succors lords and stop the rage betime,2
For being green there is great hope of help.,2
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?,2
Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;,2
If York with all his far-fet policy,2
He never would have stay'd in France so long.,2
I rather would have lost my life betimes,2
By staying there so long till all were lost.,2
Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.,2
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:,2
Thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there,2
What worse than nought? nay then a shame take all!,2
My Lord of York try what your fortune is.,2
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:,2
Collected choicely from each county some,2
I will my lord so please his majesty.,2
And what we do establish he confirms:,2
I am content: provide me soldiers lords,2
A charge Lord York that I will see perform'd.,2
No more of him; for I will deal with him,2
And so break off; the day is almost spent:,2
My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days,2
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.,2
Exeunt all but YORK,2
And change misdoubt to resolution:,2
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:,2
And find no harbour in a royal heart.,2
on thought,2
My brain more busy than the labouring spider,2
Well nobles well 'tis politicly done,2
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,2
your hearts.,2
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured,2
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,2
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;,2
Until the golden circuit on my head,2
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.,2
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,2
To make commotion as full well he can,2
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade,2
And fought so long till that his thighs with darts,2
And in the end being rescued I have seen,2
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.,2
Hath he conversed with the enemy,2
And given me notice of their villanies.,2
For that John Mortimer which now is dead,2
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,2
Say he be taken rack'd and tortured,2
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.,2
Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,2
For Humphrey being dead as he shall be,2
Exit,2
Enter certain Murderers hastily,2
We have dispatch'd the duke as he commanded.,2
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?,2
Here comes my lord.,2
Ay my good lord he's dead.,2
I will reward you for this venturous deed.,2
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,2
Tis my good lord.,2
Exeunt Murderers,2
Go call our uncle to our presence straight;,2
If he be guilty as 'tis published.,2
Exit,2
Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester,2
He be approved in practise culpable.,2
That faultless may condemn a nobleman!,2
I thank thee Meg; these words content me much.,2
How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?,2
Dead in his bed my lord; Gloucester is dead.,2
God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night,2
KING HENRY VI swoons,2
Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.,2
He doth revive again: madam be patient.,2
How fares my gracious lord?,2
What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?,2
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;,2
By crying comfort from a hollow breast,2
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;,2
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.,2
Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny,2
Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding:,2
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;,2
In life but double death now Gloucester's dead.,2
Although the duke was enemy to him,2
And for myself foe as he was to me,2
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,2
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,2
What know I how the world may deem of me?,2
It may be judged I made the duke away;,2
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.,2
To be a queen and crown'd with infamy!,2
Be woe for me more wretched than he is.,2
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.,2
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.,2
Why then dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.,2
And make my image but an alehouse sign.,2
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank,2
What boded this but well forewarning wind,2
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?,2
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:,2
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock,2
But left that hateful office unto thee:,2
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,2
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands,2
Because thy flinty heart more hard than they,2
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,2
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,2
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,2
A heart it was bound in with diamonds,2
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:,2
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,2
For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.,2
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,2
When he to madding Dido would unfold,2
Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?,2
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.,2
It is reported mighty sovereign,2
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.,2
That want their leader scatter up and down,2
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,2
That he is dead good Warwick 'tis too true;,2
Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse,2
That shall I do my liege. Stay Salisbury,2
Exit,2
My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul,2
If my suspect be false forgive me God,2
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips,2
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,2
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:,2
And to survey his dead and earthly image,2
Re-enter WARWICK and others bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed,2
That is to see how deep my grave is made;,2
For seeing him I see my life in death.,2
With that dread King that took our state upon him,2
I do believe that violent hands were laid,2
A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue!,2
See how the blood is settled in his face.,2
Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless,2
Who in the conflict that it holds with death,2
Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth,2
But see his face is black and full of blood,2
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;,2
His hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd,2
Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking;,2
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.,2
The least of all these signs were probable.,2
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;,2
But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,2
Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;,2
Then you belike suspect these noblemen,2
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,2
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?,2
But may imagine how the bird was dead,2
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.,2
Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?,2
But here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease,2
That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.,2
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.,2
What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him?,2
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,2
Madam be still; with reverence may I say;,2
Is slander to your royal dignity.,2
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,2
Some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock,2
And never of the Nevils' noble race.,2
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,2
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,2
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,2
That thou thyself was born in bastardy;,2
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,2
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,2
Away even now or I will drag thee hence:,2
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.,2
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!,2
And he but naked though lock'd up in steel,2
A noise within,2
Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK with their weapons drawn,2
Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?,2
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury,2
[To the Commons entering]  Sirs stand apart;,2
Dread lord the commons send you word by me,2
Or banished fair England's territories,2
And torture him with grievous lingering death.,2
They say in him they fear your highness' death;,2
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,2
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.,2
That if your highness should intend to sleep,2
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,2
Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue,2
It were but necessary you were waked,2
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;,2
That they will guard you whether you will or no,2
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,2
They say is shamefully bereft of life.,2
Lord of Salisbury!,2
Could send such message to their sovereign:,2
To show how quaint an orator you are:,2
Is that he was the lord ambassador,2
[Within]  An answer from the king or we will all break in!,2
I thank them for their tender loving care;,2
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;,2
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:,2
Whose far unworthy deputy I am,2
But three days longer on the pain of death.,2
O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk!,2
No more I say: if thou dost plead for him,2
Had I but said I would have kept my word,2
If after three days' space thou here be'st found,2
The world shall not be ransom for thy life.,2
I have great matters to impart to thee.,2
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!,2
Be playfellows to keep you company!,2
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!,2
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.,2
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?,2
Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan,2
As curst as harsh and horrible to hear,2
With full as many signs of deadly hate,2
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;,2
Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract;,2
And even now my burthen'd heart would break,2
Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste!,2
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!,2
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,2
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--,2
And these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass,2
And turn the force of them upon thyself.,2
Now by the ground that I am banish'd from,2
Though standing naked on a mountain top,2
And think it but a minute spent in sport.,2
That I may dew it with my mournful tears;,2
To wash away my woful monuments.,2
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,2
So get thee gone that I may know my grief;,2
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.,2
Adventure to be banished myself:,2
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.,2
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,2
Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!,2
Once by the king and three times thrice by thee.,2
A wilderness is populous enough,2
For where thou art there is the world itself,2
And where thou art not desolation.,2
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.,2
Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news I prithee?,2
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;,2
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,2
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost,2
And whispers to his pillow as to him,2
And I am sent to tell his majesty,2
Go tell this heavy message to the king.,2
Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!,2
Omitting Suffolk's exile my soul's treasure?,2
And with the southern clouds contend in tears,2
Now get thee hence: the king thou know'st is coming;,2
If I depart from thee I cannot live;,2
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?,2
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe,2
Where from thy sight I should be raging mad,2
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;,2
Or I should breathe it so into thy body,2
To die by thee were but to die in jest;,2
O let me stay befall what may befall!,2
It is applied to a deathful wound.,2
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,2
I go.,2
A jewel lock'd into the wofull'st cask,2
Even as a splitted bark so sunder we,2
This way for me.,2
SCENE III. A bedchamber.,2
How fares my lord? speak Beaufort to,2
If thou be'st death I'll give thee England's treasure,2
So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain.,2
Where death's approach is seen so terrible!,2
Bring me unto my trial when you will.,2
Can I make men live whether they will or no?,2
Alive again? then show me where he is:,2
He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them.,2
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.,2
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.,2
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!,2
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.,2
See how the pangs of death do make him grin!,2
Peace to his soul if God's good pleasure be!,2
Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope.,2
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.,2
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;,2
Exeunt,2
SCENE I. The coast of Kent.,2
The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day,2
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades,2
Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings,2
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.,2
For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,2
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.,2
And thou that art his mate make boot of this;,2
What is my ransom master? let me know.,2
Master's-Mate And so much shall you give or off goes yours.,2
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?,2
The lives of those which we have lost in fight,2
I'll give it sir; and therefore spare my life.,2
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,2
To SUFFOLK,2
Be not so rash; take ransom let him live.,2
Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid.,2
How now! why start'st thou? what doth,2
Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death.,2
And told me that by water I should die:,2
Thy name is Gaultier being rightly sounded.,2
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,2
Therefore when merchant-like I sell revenge,2
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!,2
The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole.,2
Ay but these rags are no part of the duke:,2
But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be.,2
The honourable blood of Lancaster,2
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?,2
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?,2
Fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board.,2
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,2
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood,2
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,2
Speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain?,2
Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou.,2
Strike off his head.,2
Yes Pole.,2
Pool! Sir Pool! lord!,2
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.,2
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:,2
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,2
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:,2
For daring to affy a mighty lord,2
Having neither subject wealth nor diadem.,2
And like ambitious Sylla overgorged,2
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,2
Disdain to call us lord and Picardy,2
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.,2
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,2
And now the house of York thrust from the crown,2
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,2
Advance our half-faced sun striving to shine,2
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:,2
Is crept into the palace of our king.,2
O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder,2
Small things make base men proud: this villain here,2
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.,2
It is impossible that I should die,2
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:,2
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.,2
Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death.,2
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.,2
My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair.,2
Used to command untaught to plead for favour.,2
With humble suit: no rather let my head,2
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;,2
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.,2
More can I bear than you dare execute.,2
Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can,2
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:,2
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand,2
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.,2
And as for these whose ransom we have set,2
Therefore come you with us and let him go.,2
Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body,2
Until the queen his mistress bury it.,2
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!,2
If he revenge it not yet will his friends;,2
Exit with the body,2
Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND,2
they have been up these two days.,2
I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress,2
So he had need for 'tis threadbare. Well I say it,2
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.,2
Nay more the king's council are no good workmen.,2
which is as much to say as let the magistrates be,2
magistrates.,2
brave mind than a hard hand.,2
tanner of Wingham--,2
dog's-leather of.,2
Then is sin struck down like an ox and iniquity's,2
And Smith the weaver--,2
Come come let's fall in with them.,2
We John Cade so termed of our supposed father--,2
For our enemies shall fall before us inspired with,2
--Command silence.,2
My father was a Mortimer--,2
bricklayer.,2
[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.,2
[Aside]  She was indeed a pedler's daughter and,2
[Aside]  But now of late notable to travel with her,2
Therefore am I of an honourable house.,2
and there was he borne under a hedge for his,2
Valiant I am.,2
I am able to endure much.,2
whipped three market-days together.,2
[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.,2
fire being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.,2
reformation. There shall be in England seven,2
pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony,2
common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to,2
God save your majesty!,2
all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will,2
like brothers and worship me their lord.,2
Nay that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable,2
be made parchment? that parchment being scribbled,2
but I say 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal,2
since. How now! who's there?,2
The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and,2
O monstrous!,2
Here's a villain!,2
Nay then he is a conjurer.,2
I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man of mine,2
Come hither sirrah I must examine thee: what is thy name?,2
They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill,2
Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or,2
plain-dealing man?,2
that I can write my name.,2
and a traitor.,2
ink-horn about his neck.,2
Enter MICHAEL,2
Here I am thou particular fellow.,2
brother are hard by with the king's forces.,2
shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:,2
No.,2
Kneels,2
Rises,2
Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD with drum and soldiers,2
Mark'd for the gallows lay your weapons down;,2
The king is merciful if you revolt.,2
If you go forward; therefore yield or die.,2
It is to you good people that I speak,2
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.,2
And thou thyself a shearman art thou not?,2
And what of that?,2
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter did he not?,2
By her he had two children at one birth.,2
Ay there's the question; but I say 'tis true:,2
Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;,2
Became a bricklayer when he came to age:,2
Nay 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.,2
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;,2
And will you credit this base drudge's words,2
Ay marry will we; therefore get ye gone.,2
[Aside]  He lies for I invented it myself.,2
father's sake Henry the Fifth in whose time boys,2
he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.,2
selling the dukedom of Maine.,2
fain to go with a staff but that my puissance holds,2
hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch:,2
therefore he is a traitor.,2
Nay answer if you can: the Frenchmen are our,2
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good,2
No no; and therefore we'll have his head.,2
Assail them with the army of the king.,2
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;,2
May even in their wives' and children's sight,2
And you that be the king's friends follow me.,2
And you that love the commons follow me.,2
We will not leave one lord one gentleman:,2
For they are thrifty honest men and such,2
They are all in order and march toward us.,2
out of order. Come march forward.,2
SCENE III. Another part of Blackheath.,2
Where's Dick the butcher of Ashford?,2
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen and thou,2
slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,2
shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking,2
I desire no more.,2
monument of the victory will I bear;,2
and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels,2
mayor's sword borne before us.,2
gaols and let out the prisoners.,2
towards London.,2
SCENE IV. London. The palace.,2
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,2
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.,2
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:,2
What answer makes your grace to the rebels',2
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;,2
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,2
Will parley with Jack Cade their general:,2
Ah barbarous villains! hath this lovely face,2
And could it not enforce them to relent,2
Lord Say Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.,2
How now madam!,2
I fear me love if that I had been dead,2
No my love I should not mourn but die for thee.,2
How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?,2
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,2
And calls your grace usurper openly,2
His army is a ragged multitude,2
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death,2
All scholars lawyers courtiers gentlemen,2
O graceless men! they know not what they do.,2
Until a power be raised to put them down.,2
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!,2
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.,2
The sight of me is odious in their eyes;,2
And live alone as secret as I may.,2
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:,2
The rascal people thirsting after prey,2
To spoil the city and your royal court.,2
Come Margaret; God our hope will succor us.,2
Farewell my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.,2
The trust I have is in mine innocence,2
Exeunt,2
Enter SCALES upon the Tower walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below,2
No my lord nor likely to be slain; for they have,2
them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from,2
Such aid as I can spare you shall command;,2
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.,2
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;,2
And so farewell for I must hence again.,2
SCENE VI. London. Cannon Street.,2
Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here sitting,2
city's cost the pissing-conduit run nothing but,2
henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls,2
Enter a Soldier running,2
Knock him down there.,2
If this fellow be wise he'll never call ye Jack,2
My lord there's an army gathered together in,2
Come then let's go fight with them; but first go,2
down the Tower too. Come let's away.,2
SCENE VII. London. Smithfield.,2
So sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy;,2
I have a suit unto your lordship.,2
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.,2
thrust in the mouth with a spear and 'tis not whole,2
[Aside]  Nay John it will be stinking law for his,2
I have thought upon it it shall be so. Away burn,2
the parliament of England.,2
unless his teeth be pulled out.,2
Enter a Messenger,2
which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay,2
pound the last subsidy.,2
Well he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,2
art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction,2
giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu the,2
presence even the presence of Lord Mortimer that I,2
filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously,2
grammar school; and whereas before our forefathers,2
hast caused printing to be used and contrary to,2
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou,2
a verb and such abominable words as no Christian,2
justices of peace to call poor men before them,2
Moreover thou hast put them in prison; and because,2
indeed only for that cause they have been most,2
What of that?,2
cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose,2
And work in their shirt too; as myself for example,2
You men of Kent--,2
Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra mala gens.',2
Hear me but speak and bear me where you will.,2
Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:,2
The people liberal valiant active wealthy;,2
I sold not Maine I lost not Normandy,2
Justice with favour have I always done;,2
When have I aught exacted at your hands,2
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,2
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,2
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,2
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings,2
Tut when struck'st thou one blow in the field?,2
Those that I never saw and struck them dead.,2
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.,2
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes,2
Ye shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet.,2
The palsy and not fear provokes me.,2
with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier,2
Tell me wherein have I offended most?,2
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?,2
Whom have I injured that ye seek my death?,2
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.,2
[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words;,2
pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he,2
God's name. Go take him away I say and strike,2
son-in-law's house Sir James Cromer and strike off,2
It shall be done.,2
God should be so obdurate as yourselves,2
And therefore yet relent and save my life.,2
Exeunt some with Lord SAY,2
on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute; there,2
her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of,2
wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.,2
commodities upon our bills?,2
O brave!,2
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,2
them again lest they consult about the giving up of,2
spoil of the city until night: for with these borne,2
the streets and at every corner have them kiss. Away!,2
SCENE VIII. Southwark.,2
Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill,2
Sound a parley,2
sound retreat or parley when I command them kill?,2
Ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee:,2
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;,2
That will forsake thee and go home in peace.,2
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;,2
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,2
Who hateth him and honours not his father,2
Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.,2
What Buckingham and Clifford are ye so brave? And,2
needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?,2
that you should leave me at the White Hart in,2
these arms till you had recovered your ancient,2
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let,2
houses over your heads ravish your wives and,2
shift for one; and so God's curse light upon you,2
We'll follow Cade we'll follow Cade!,2
That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?,2
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?,2
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,2
Were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar,2
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?,2
I see them lording it in London streets,2
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry,2
To France to France and get what you have lost;,2
Henry hath money you are strong and manly;,2
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.,2
multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them,2
desolate. I see them lay their heads together to,2
no staying. In despite of the devils and hell have,2
honour be witness that no want of resolution in me.,2
treasons makes me betake me to my heels.,2
What is he fled? Go some and follow him;,2
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.,2
Follow me soldiers: we'll devise a mean,2
Exeunt,2
Sound Trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET on the terrace,2
And could command no more content than I?,2
But I was made a king at nine months old.,2
As I do long and wish to be a subject.,2
Health and glad tidings to your majesty!,2
Or is he but retired to make him strong?,2
He is fled my lord and all his powers do yield;,2
Expect your highness' doom of life or death.,2
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!,2
And show'd how well you love your prince and country:,2
And Henry though he be infortunate,2
And so with thanks and pardon to you all,2
God save the king! God save the king!,2
Please it your grace to be advertised,2
And with a puissant and a mighty power,2
Is marching hitherward in proud array,2
His arms are only to remove from thee,2
Thus stands my state 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.,2
Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:,2
And now is York in arms to second him.,2
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.,2
And Somerset we'll commit thee thither,2
My lord,2
Or unto death to do my country good.,2
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.,2
As all things shall redound unto your good.,2
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.,2
SCENE X. Kent. IDEN's garden.,2
Fie on ambition! fie on myself that have a sword,2
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for,2
hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a,2
on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden to,2
while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach,2
was born to do me good: for many a time but for a,2
bill; and many a time when I have been dry and,2
quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet',2
Enter IDEN,2
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?,2
Contenteth me and worth a monarchy.,2
Or gather wealth I care not with what envy:,2
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.,2
stray for entering his fee-simple without leave.,2
crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but,2
my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part.,2
I know thee not; why then should I betray thee?,2
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,2
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?,2
broached and beard thee too. Look on me well: I,2
thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead,2
Nay it shall ne'er be said while England stands,2
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.,2
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:,2
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,2
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;,2
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.,2
Let this my sword report what speech forbears.,2
heard! Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out,2
sleep in thy sheath I beseech God on my knees thou,2
Here they fight. CADE falls,2
let ten thousand devils come against me and give me,2
all. Wither garden; and be henceforth a,2
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.,2
Sword I will hollow thee for this thy deed,2
Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;,2
To emblaze the honour that thy master got.,2
Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort,2
feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour.,2
How much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge.,2
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,2
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels,2
And there cut off thy most ungracious head;,2
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.,2
ACT V,2
Enter YORK and his army of Irish with drum and colours,2
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:,2
To entertain great England's lawful king.,2
Let them obey that know not how to rule;,2
I cannot give due action to my words,2
A sceptre shall it have have I a soul,2
Enter BUCKINGHAM,2
The king hath sent him sure: I must dissemble.,2
Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting.,2
A messenger from Henry our dread liege,2
Or why thou being a subject as I am,2
Should raise so great a power without his leave,2
[Aside]  Scarce can I speak my choler is so great:,2
I am so angry at these abject terms;,2
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.,2
More like a king more kingly in my thoughts:,2
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong--,2
That I have given no answer all this while;,2
The cause why I have brought this army hither,2
Seditious to his grace and to the state.,2
But if thy arms be to no other end,2
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.,2
Upon mine honour he is prisoner.,2
Soldiers I thank you all; disperse yourselves;,2
You shall have pay and every thing you wish.,2
Command my eldest son nay all my sons,2
I'll send them all as willing as I live:,2
Is his to use so Somerset may die.,2
We twain will go into his highness' tent.,2
Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us,2
In all submission and humility,2
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?,2
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,2
Enter IDEN with CADE'S head,2
May pass into the presence of a king,2
The head of Cade whom I in combat slew.,2
O let me view his visage being dead,2
Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him?,2
How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?,2
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.,2
He were created knight for his good service.,2
He kneels,2
We give thee for reward a thousand marks,2
May Iden live to merit such a bounty.,2
Rises,2
See Buckingham Somerset comes with the queen:,2
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,2
How now! is Somerset at liberty?,2
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.,2
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,2
King did I call thee? no thou art not king,2
Which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor.,2
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,2
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,2
Is able with the change to kill and cure.,2
And with the same to act controlling laws.,2
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.,2
Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;,2
Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,2
Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail;,2
I know ere they will have me go to ward,2
Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,2
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.,2
O blood-besotted Neapolitan,2
The sons of York thy betters in their birth,2
That for my surety will refuse the boys!,2
See where they come: I'll warrant they'll,2
Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD,2
Health and all happiness to my lord the king!,2
I thank thee Clifford: say what news with thee?,2
We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again;,2
This is my king York I do not mistake;,2
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?,2
Makes him oppose himself against his king.,2
And chop away that factious pate of his.,2
His sons he says shall give their words for him.,2
Ay noble father if our words will serve.,2
Why what a brood of traitors have we here!,2
I am thy king and thou a false-heart traitor.,2
That with the very shaking of their chains,2
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.,2
Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.,2
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.,2
Run back and bite because he was withheld;,2
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:,2
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.,2
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!,2
Take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves.,2
Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair,2
What wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,2
O where is faith? O where is loyalty?,2
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?,2
And shame thine honourable age with blood?,2
Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it?,2
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.,2
The title of this most renowned duke;,2
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.,2
I have.,2
It is great sin to swear unto a sin,2
Who can be bound by any solemn vow,2
To force a spotless virgin's chastity,2
To wring the widow from her custom'd right,2
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?,2
Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself.,2
I am resolved for death or dignity.,2
You were best to go to bed and dream again,2
I am resolved to bear a greater storm,2
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,2
Now by my father's badge old Nevil's crest,2
This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,2
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,2
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear,2
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.,2
To quell the rebels and their complices.,2
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.,2
If not in heaven you'll surely sup in hell.,2
SCENE II. Saint Alban's.,2
Clifford of Cumberland 'tis Warwick calls:,2
Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum,2
Clifford I say come forth and fight with me:,2
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.,2
How now my noble lord? what all afoot?,2
But match to match I have encounter'd him,2
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.,2
Of one or both of us the time is come.,2
For I myself must hunt this deer to death.,2
As I intend Clifford to thrive to-day,2
Exit,2
With thy brave bearing should I be in love,2
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,2
So let it help me now against thy sword,2
My soul and body on the action both!,2
They fight and CLIFFORD falls,2
Dies,2
Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will!,2
Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD,2
Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds,2
Whom angry heavens do make their minister,2
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.,2
Hath no self-love nor he that loves himself,2
The name of valour.,2
O let the vile world end,2
Knit earth and heaven together!,2
Particularities and petty sounds,2
To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve,2
And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus,2
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,2
No more will I their babes: tears virginal,2
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims,2
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:,2
Into as many gobbets will I cut it,2
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.,2
As did AEneas old Anchises bear,2
But then AEneas bare a living load,2
Exit bearing off his father,2
So lie thou there;,2
The Castle in Saint Alban's Somerset,2
Sword hold thy temper; heart be wrathful still:,2
Exit,2
Away my lord! you are slow; for shame away!,2
What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:,2
To give the enemy way and to secure us,2
Alarum afar off,2
Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,2
We shall to London get where you are loved,2
May readily be stopp'd.,2
But that my heart's on future mischief set,2
But fly you must; uncurable discomfit,2
Away for your relief! and we will live,2
Away my lord away!,2
SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.,2
Of Salisbury who can report of him,2
Aged contusions and all brush of time,2
Repairs him with occasion? This happy day,2
If Salisbury be lost.,2
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,2
Persuaded him from any further act:,2
And like rich hangings in a homely house,2
But noble as he is look where he comes.,2
Now by my sword well hast thou fought to-day;,2
God knows how long it is I have to live;,2
You have defended me from imminent death.,2
Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,2
I know our safety is to follow them;,2
To call a present court of parliament.,2
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?,2
Now by my faith lords 'twas a glorious day:,2
Shall be eternized in all age to come.,2
And more such days as these to us befall!,2
ACT I,3
Alarum. Enter YORK EDWARD RICHARD NORFOLK MONTAGUE WARWICK and Soldiers,3
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,3
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,3
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,3
Charged our main battle's front and breaking in,3
Lord Stafford's father Duke of Buckingham,3
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:,3
And brother here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,3
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.,3
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.,3
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!,3
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,3
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,3
This is the palace of the fearful king,3
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs',3
For hither we have broken in by force.,3
Thanks gentle Norfolk: stay by me my lords;,3
They go up,3
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.,3
But little thinks we shall be of her council:,3
Arm'd as we are let's stay within this house.,3
Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be king,3
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.,3
I mean to take possession of my right.,3
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,3
I'll plant Plantagenet root him up who dares:,3
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND WESTMORELAND EXETER and the rest,3
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,3
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.,3
And thine Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge,3
If I be not heavens be revenged on me!,3
What shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:,3
Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland.,3
He durst not sit there had your father lived.,3
Let us assail the family of York.,3
Ah know you not the city favours them,3
But when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly.,3
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!,3
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.,3
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;,3
I am thine.,3
Twas my inheritance as the earldom was.,3
Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown,3
Whom should he follow but his natural king?,3
And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne?,3
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.,3
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.,3
That we are those which chased you from the field,3
March'd through the city to the palace gates.,3
And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it.,3
Thy kinsman and thy friends I'll have more lives,3
Urge it no more; lest that instead of words,3
As shall revenge his death before I stir.,3
Will you we show our title to the crown?,3
What title hast thou traitor to the crown?,3
Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March:,3
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,3
Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all.,3
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.,3
Father tear the crown from the usurper's head.,3
Good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms,3
Sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly.,3
Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.,3
And be you silent and attentive too,3
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,3
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;,3
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,3
My title's good and better far than his.,3
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.,3
[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--,3
What then?,3
For Richard in the view of many lords,3
Whose heir my father was and I am his.,3
And made him to resign his crown perforce.,3
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?,3
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.,3
His is the right and therefore pardon me.,3
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.,3
Plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st,3
Deposed he shall be in despite of all.,3
Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent,3
Can set the duke up in despite of me.,3
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:,3
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!,3
Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown.,3
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,3
And over the chair of state where now he sits,3
He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves,3
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.,3
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.,3
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.,3
What good is this to England and himself!,3
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!,3
Nor I.,3
Farewell faint-hearted and degenerate king,3
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,3
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,3
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND CLIFFORD and WESTMORELAND,3
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.,3
Why should you sigh my lord?,3
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.,3
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;,3
To cease this civil war and whilst I live,3
And neither by treason nor hostility,3
This oath I willingly take and will perform.,3
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!,3
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!,3
Farewell my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.,3
And I to Norfolk with my followers.,3
Exeunt YORK EDWARD EDMUND GEORGE RICHARD  WARWICK NORFOLK MONTAGUE their Soldiers and Attendants,3
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD,3
I'll steal away.,3
Nay go not from me; I will follow thee.,3
Who can be patient in such extremes?,3
And never seen thee never borne thee son,3
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?,3
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,3
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,3
And disinherited thine only son.,3
If you be king why should not I succeed?,3
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.,3
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah timorous wretch!,3
And given unto the house of York such head,3
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,3
And creep into it far before thy time?,3
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;,3
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds,3
Had I been there which am a silly woman,3
Before I would have granted to that act.,3
And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself,3
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd,3
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours,3
And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace,3
Thus do I leave thee. Come son let's away;,3
Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak.,3
Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me?,3
When I return with victory from the field,3
Come son away; we may not linger thus.,3
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son,3
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,3
Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle,3
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:,3
Come cousin you shall be the messenger.,3
Exeunt,3
Enter RICHARD EDWARD and MONTAGUE,3
No I can better play the orator.,3
Enter YORK,3
What is your quarrel? how began it first?,3
About what?,3
The crown of England father which is yours.,3
Your right depends not on his life or death.,3
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,3
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.,3
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.,3
I shall be if I claim by open war.,3
Thou canst not son; it is impossible.,3
Before a true and lawful magistrate,3
Henry had none but did usurp the place;,3
Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous.,3
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;,3
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.,3
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed,3
Richard enough; I will be king or die.,3
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.,3
And tell him privily of our intent.,3
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:,3
Witty courteous liberal full of spirit.,3
But that I seek occasion how to rise,3
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?,3
But stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?,3
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:,3
And therefore fortify your hold my lord.,3
Edward and Richard you shall stay with me;,3
Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest,3
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,3
Brother I go; I'll win them fear it not:,3
Exit,3
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles,3
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.,3
What with five thousand men?,3
A woman's general; what should we fear?,3
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,3
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,3
Many a battle have I won in France,3
Why should I not now have the like success?,3
SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.,3
Ah whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?,3
Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers,3
As for the brat of this accursed duke,3
And I my lord will bear him company.,3
Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child,3
Exit dragged off by Soldiers,3
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.,3
That trembles under his devouring paws;,3
And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder.,3
And not with such a cruel threatening look.,3
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:,3
In vain thou speak'st poor boy; my father's blood,3
Then let my father's blood open it again:,3
Had thy brethren here their lives and thine,3
No if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves,3
It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart.,3
Is as a fury to torment my soul;,3
And leave not one alive I live in hell.,3
Lifting his hand,3
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford pity me!,3
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?,3
But 'twas ere I was born.,3
Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just,3
Ah let me live in prison all my days;,3
Then let me die for now thou hast no cause.,3
Thy father slew my father; therefore die.,3
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!,3
Plantagenet! I come Plantagenet!,3
Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood,3
Exit,3
Alarum. Enter YORK,3
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;,3
Turn back and fly like ships before the wind,3
My sons God knows what hath bechanced them:,3
Like men born to renown by life or death.,3
And thrice cried 'Courage father! fight it out!',3
With purple falchion painted to the hilt,3
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,3
And cried 'A crown or else a glorious tomb!,3
With this we charged again: but out alas!,3
With bootless labour swim against the tide,3
A short alarum within,3
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:,3
The sands are number'd that make up my life;,3
Enter QUEEN MARGARET CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND PRINCE EDWARD and Soldiers,3
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:,3
Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet.,3
With downright payment show'd unto my father.,3
And made an evening at the noontide prick.,3
A bird that will revenge upon you all:,3
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.,3
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;,3
So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives,3
O Clifford but bethink thee once again,3
And if though canst for blushing view this face,3
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!,3
But buckle with thee blows twice two for one.,3
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.,3
Hold Clifford! do not honour him so much,3
What valour were it when a cur doth grin,3
When he might spurn him with his foot away?,3
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.,3
Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin.,3
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;,3
What would your grace have done unto him now?,3
Come make him stand upon this molehill here,3
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.,3
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,3
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?,3
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,3
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?,3
Look York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood,3
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;,3
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.,3
I should lament thy miserable state.,3
What hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails,3
Why art thou patient man? thou shouldst be mad;,3
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance.,3
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.,3
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.,3
Ay marry sir now looks he like a king!,3
And this is he was his adopted heir.,3
Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath?,3
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.,3
And rob his temples of the diadem,3
O 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!,3
And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead.,3
Nay stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.,3
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!,3
To triumph like an Amazonian trull,3
But that thy face is vizard-like unchanging,3
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush.,3
Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless.,3
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,3
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?,3
Unless the adage must be verified,3
Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;,3
Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;,3
Tis government that makes them seem divine;,3
Thou art as opposite to every good,3
Or as the south to the septentrion.,3
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,3
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?,3
Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless.,3
Wouldst have me weep? why now thou hast thy will:,3
And when the rage allays the rain begins.,3
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,3
Frenchwoman.,3
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.,3
Would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood:,3
O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania.,3
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,3
Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this:,3
Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears;,3
And say 'Alas it was a piteous deed!',3
And in thy need such comfort come to thee,3
Hard-hearted Clifford take me from the world:,3
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,3
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.,3
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,3
Here's for my oath here's for my father's death.,3
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.,3
Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God!,3
Dies,3
So York may overlook the town of York.,3
ACT II,3
A march. Enter EDWARD RICHARD and their power,3
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no,3
Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news;,3
Or had he 'scaped methinks we should have heard,3
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?,3
Where our right valiant father is become.,3
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.,3
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;,3
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,3
So fared our father with his enemies;,3
Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son.,3
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!,3
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!,3
Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun;,3
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.,3
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:,3
In this the heaven figures some event.,3
I think it cites us brother to the field,3
Each one already blazing by our meeds,3
And over-shine the earth as this the world.,3
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.,3
You love the breeder better than the male.,3
But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell,3
Ah one that was a woful looker-on,3
Your princely father and my loving lord!,3
Say how he died for I will hear it all.,3
And stood against them as the hope of Troy,3
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;,3
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.,3
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm,3
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,3
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks,3
Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain:,3
They took his head and on the gates of York,3
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.,3
Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay.,3
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;,3
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.,3
Ah would she break from hence that this my body,3
For never henceforth shall I joy again,3
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture,3
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;,3
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,3
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:,3
Richard I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,3
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;,3
Nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird,3
For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say;,3
March. Enter WARWICK MONTAGUE and their army,3
Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount,3
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,3
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain!,3
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,3
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;,3
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.,3
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,3
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.,3
Muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends,3
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,3
For by my scouts I was advertised,3
To dash our late decree in parliament,3
Short tale to make we at Saint Alban's met,3
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,3
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;,3
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,3
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,3
Our soldiers' like the night-owl's lazy flight,3
Fell gently down as if they struck their friends.,3
With promise of high pay and great rewards:,3
And we in them no hope to win the day;,3
Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself,3
For in the marches here we heard you were,3
Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick?,3
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;,3
From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy,3
Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled:,3
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.,3
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine,3
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,3
As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer.,3
Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.,3
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,3
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?,3
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?,3
Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out;,3
Attend me lords. The proud insulting queen,3
And of their feather many more proud birds,3
He swore consent to your succession,3
And now to London all the crew are gone,3
May make against the house of Lancaster.,3
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself,3
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,3
Why Via! to London will we march amain,3
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!',3
Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:,3
That cries 'Retire' if Warwick bid him stay.,3
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--,3
No longer Earl of March but Duke of York:,3
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd,3
And he that throws not up his cap for joy,3
King Edward valiant Richard Montague,3
But sound the trumpets and about our task.,3
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,3
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!,3
How now! what news?,3
The queen is coming with a puissant host;,3
Why then it sorts brave warriors let's away.,3
SCENE II. Before York.,3
Welcome my lord to this brave town of York.,3
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:,3
Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:,3
Withhold revenge dear God! 'tis not my fault,3
My gracious liege this too much lenity,3
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?,3
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?,3
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?,3
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,3
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,3
He but a duke would have his son a king,3
Thou being a king blest with a goodly son,3
Which argued thee a most unloving father.,3
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,3
Who hath not seen them even with those wings,3
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,3
For shame my liege make them your precedent!,3
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,3
What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got,3
Ah what a shame were this! Look on the boy;,3
Successful fortune steel thy melting heart,3
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,3
But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear,3
And happy always was it for that son,3
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;,3
For all the rest is held at such a rate,3
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.,3
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!,3
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.,3
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.,3
Edward Plantagenet arise a knight;,3
My gracious father by your kingly leave,3
And in that quarrel use it to the death.,3
Enter a Messenger,3
For with a band of thirty thousand men,3
And in the towns as they do march along,3
Darraign your battle for they are at hand.,3
The queen hath best success when you are absent.,3
Why that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.,3
My royal father cheer these noble lords,3
Unsheathe your sword good father; cry 'Saint George!',3
Now perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,3
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?,3
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms,3
I am his king and he should bow his knee;,3
Since when his oath is broke; for as I hear,3
Have caused him by new act of parliament,3
And reason too:,3
Are you there butcher? O I cannot speak!,3
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.,3
Ay and old York and yet not satisfied.,3
What say'st thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown?,3
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,3
Then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine.,3
Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence.,3
Northumberland I hold thee reverently.,3
The execution of my big-swoln heart,3
I slew thy father call'st thou him a child?,3
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;,3
Have done with words my lords and hear me speak.,3
I prithee give no limits to my tongue:,3
My liege the wound that bred this meeting here,3
Then executioner unsheathe thy sword:,3
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.,3
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,3
If thou deny their blood upon thy head;,3
If that be right which Warwick says is right,3
Whoever got thee there thy mother stands;,3
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;,3
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,3
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,3
As if a channel should be call'd the sea--,3
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?,3
To make this shameless callet know herself.,3
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;,3
By that false woman as this king by thee.,3
And tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop;,3
He might have kept that glory to this day;,3
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,3
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,3
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?,3
And we in pity of the gentle king,3
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,3
We set the axe to thy usurping root;,3
Yet know thou since we have begun to strike,3
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.,3
Not willing any longer conference,3
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!,3
Stay Edward.,3
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.,3
SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in,3
Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK,3
I lay me down a little while to breathe;,3
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,3
Enter EDWARD running,3
For this world frowns and Edward's sun is clouded.,3
Enter GEORGE,3
Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us:,3
Bootless is flight they follow us with wings;,3
Enter RICHARD,3
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,3
And in the very pangs of death he cried,3
Warwick revenge! brother revenge my death!',3
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,3
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:,3
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,3
And look upon as if the tragedy,3
Here on my knee I vow to God above,3
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine,3
O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine;,3
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,3
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,3
That to my foes this body must be prey,3
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!,3
Where'er it be in heaven or in earth.,3
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:,3
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.,3
Yet let us all together to our troops,3
And call them pillars that will stand to us;,3
As victors wear at the Olympian games:,3
For yet is hope of life and victory.,3
Exeunt,3
Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD,3
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,3
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.,3
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;,3
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death,3
To execute the like upon thyself;,3
They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies,3
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.,3
SCENE V. Another part of the field.,3
This battle fares like to the morning's war,3
What time the shepherd blowing of his nails,3
Now sways it this way like a mighty sea,3
Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea,3
Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind;,3
Both tugging to be victors breast to breast,3
So is the equal of this fell war.,3
To whom God will there be the victory!,3
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both,3
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;,3
O God! methinks it were a happy life,3
To sit upon a hill as I do now,3
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,3
How many hours bring about the day;,3
How many years a mortal man may live.,3
So many hours must I tend my flock;,3
So many hours must I contemplate;,3
So many days my ewes have been with young;,3
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:,3
Pass'd over to the end they were created,3
Ah what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!,3
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,3
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?,3
And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds,3
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,3
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,3
His body couched in a curious bed,3
Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father dragging in the dead body,3
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight,3
And I that haply take them from him now,3
To some man else as this dead man doth me.,3
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.,3
From London by the king was I press'd forth;,3
Came on the part of York press'd by his master;,3
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.,3
And pardon father for I knew not thee!,3
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.,3
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,3
Weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear;,3
Be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief.,3
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,3
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.,3
Ah no no no it is mine only son!,3
Throw up thine eye! see see what showers arise,3
Upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart!,3
What stratagems how fell how butcherly,3
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!,3
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!,3
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!,3
The red rose and the white are on his face,3
The one his purple blood right well resembles;,3
Wither one rose and let the other flourish;,3
How will my mother for a father's death,3
How will my wife for slaughter of my son,3
How will the country for these woful chances,3
Was ever son so rued a father's death?,3
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?,3
I'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fill.,3
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;,3
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;,3
And so obsequious will thy father be,3
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.,3
For I have murdered where I should not kill.,3
Sad-hearted men much overgone with care,3
Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD and EXETER,3
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:,3
Mount you my lord; towards Berwick post amain:,3
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,3
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,3
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:,3
Or else come after: I'll away before.,3
Not that I fear to stay but love to go,3
Exeunt,3
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD wounded,3
Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light.,3
More than my body's parting with my soul!,3
And now I fall thy tough commixture melts.,3
The common people swarm like summer flies;,3
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?,3
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,3
And Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,3
Giving no ground unto the house of York,3
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm,3
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.,3
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?,3
No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight:,3
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.,3
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.,3
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breast.,3
Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD MONTAGUE WARWICK and Soldiers,3
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.,3
That led calm Henry though he were a king,3
Command an argosy to stem the waves.,3
No 'tis impossible he should escape,3
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:,3
CLIFFORD groans and dies,3
A deadly groan like life and death's departing.,3
If friend or foe let him be gently used.,3
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch,3
But set his murdering knife unto the root,3
I mean our princely father Duke of York.,3
Your father's head which Clifford placed there;,3
Measure for measure must be answered.,3
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:,3
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.,3
Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee?,3
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.,3
Tis but his policy to counterfeit,3
Which in the time of death he gave our father.,3
Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace.,3
Clifford devise excuses for thy faults.,3
Thou didst love York and I am son to York.,3
Where's Captain Margaret to fence you now?,3
What not an oath? nay then the world goes hard,3
I know by that he's dead; and by my soul,3
That I in all despite might rail at him,3
issuing blood,3
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.,3
And rear it in the place your father's stands.,3
There to be crowned England's royal king:,3
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:,3
And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread,3
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,3
First will I see the coronation;,3
To effect this marriage so it please my lord.,3
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,3
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.,3
And George of Clarence: Warwick as ourself,3
Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester;,3
Tut that's a foolish observation:,3
To see these honours in possession.,3
ACT III,3
Enter two Keepers with cross-bows in their hands,3
For through this laund anon the deer will come;,3
Culling the principal of all the deer.,3
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow,3
Here stand we both and aim we at the best:,3
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day,3
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.,3
From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love,3
No Harry Harry 'tis no land of thine;,3
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:,3
No humble suitors press to speak for right,3
For how can I help them and not myself?,3
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.,3
For wise men say it is the wisest course.,3
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.,3
And as I hear the great commanding Warwick,3
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,3
For Warwick is a subtle orator,3
By this account then Margaret may win him;,3
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;,3
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;,3
To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears.,3
She on his left side craving aid for Henry,3
She weeps and says her Henry is deposed;,3
That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more;,3
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,3
With promise of his sister and what else,3
O Margaret thus 'twill be; and thou poor soul,3
Say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?,3
A man at least for less I should not be;,3
Ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.,3
But if thou be a king where is thy crown?,3
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,3
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.,3
Your crown content and you must be contented,3
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;,3
Will apprehend you as his enemy.,3
No never such an oath; nor will not now.,3
Here in this country where we now remain.,3
My father and my grandfather were kings,3
And tell me then have you not broke your oaths?,3
For we were subjects but while you were king.,3
Ah simple men you know not what you swear!,3
And as the air blows it to me again,3
And yielding to another when it blows,3
Such is the lightness of you common men.,3
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.,3
And be you kings command and I'll obey.,3
So would you be again to Henry,3
We charge you in God's name and the king's,3
In God's name lead; your king's name be obey'd:,3
And what he will I humbly yield unto.,3
SCENE II. London. The palace.,3
Brother of Gloucester at Saint Alban's field,3
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:,3
Which we in justice cannot well deny,3
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.,3
It were dishonour to deny it her.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea is it so?,3
Before the king will grant her humble suit.,3
he keeps the wind!,3
Widow we will consider of your suit;,3
Right gracious lord I cannot brook delay:,3
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.,3
you all your lands,3
Fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow.,3
chance to fall.,3
take vantages.,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay whip me then: he'll rather,3
Three my most gracious lord.,3
be ruled by him.,3
Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay good leave have you; for,3
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.,3
Now tell me madam do you love your children?,3
And would you not do much to do them good?,3
Then get your husband's lands to do them good.,3
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.,3
What service wilt thou do me if I give them?,3
But you will take exceptions to my boon.,3
Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay then,3
Why stops my lord shall I not hear my task?,3
That's soon perform'd because I am a subject.,3
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.,3
with a curtsy.,3
The fruits of love I mean my loving liege.,3
What love think'st thou I sue so much to get?,3
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.,3
Why then you mean not as I thought you did.,3
My mind will never grant what I perceive,3
To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee.,3
Why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.,3
For by that loss I will not purchase them.,3
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.,3
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:,3
Ay if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;,3
Then no my lord. My suit is at an end.,3
knits her brows.,3
Christendom.,3
Her words do show her wit incomparable;,3
One way or other she is for a king;,3
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?,3
I am a subject fit to jest withal,3
Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee,3
And that is to enjoy thee for my love.,3
I know I am too mean to be your queen,3
You cavil widow: I did mean my queen.,3
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.,3
And by God's mother I being but a bachelor,3
To be the father unto many sons.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,3
Brothers you muse what chat we two have had.,3
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.,3
Why Clarence to myself.,3
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.,3
Well jest on brothers: I can tell you both,3
Enter a Nobleman,3
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.,3
And go we brothers to the man that took him,3
Widow go you along. Lords use her honourably.,3
Ay Edward will use women honourably.,3
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,3
And yet between my soul's desire and me--,3
Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward,3
To take their rooms ere I can place myself:,3
Why then I do but dream on sovereignty;,3
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,3
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,3
So do I wish the crown being so far off;,3
And so I say I'll cut the causes off,3
My eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much,3
Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard;,3
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,3
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.,3
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!,3
And for I should not deal in her soft laws,3
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;,3
Where sits deformity to mock my body;,3
To disproportion me in every part,3
That carries no impression like the dam.,3
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought!,3
But to command to cheque to o'erbear such,3
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,3
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head,3
And yet I know not how to get the crown,3
And I--like one lost in a thorny wood,3
Seeking a way and straying from the way;,3
But toiling desperately to find it out--,3
And from that torment I will free myself,3
Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile,3
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,3
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;,3
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,3
And like a Sinon take another Troy.,3
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,3
Can I do this and cannot get a crown?,3
Exit,3
Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI his sister BONA  his Admiral called BOURBON PRINCE EDWARD QUEEN  MARGARET and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits and riseth up again,3
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state,3
No mighty King of France: now Margaret,3
Where kings command. I was I must confess,3
But now mischance hath trod my title down,3
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,3
Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair?,3
And stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares.,3
And sit thee by our side:,3
Yield not thy neck,3
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.,3
It shall be eased if France can yield relief.,3
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.,3
That Henry sole possessor of my love,3
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;,3
Usurps the regal title and the seat,3
This is the cause that I poor Margaret,3
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;,3
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help;,3
Our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight,3
Renowned queen with patience calm the storm,3
The more we stay the stronger grows our foe.,3
O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.,3
Enter WARWICK,3
Our Earl of Warwick Edward's greatest friend.,3
He descends. She ariseth,3
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.,3
My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend,3
First to do greetings to thy royal person;,3
And lastly to confirm that amity,3
That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister,3
[Aside]  If that go forward Henry's hope is done.,3
I am commanded with your leave and favour,3
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;,3
Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.,3
Before you answer Warwick. His demand,3
But from deceit bred by necessity;,3
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?,3
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,3
Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage,3
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,3
Injurious Margaret!,3
Because thy father Henry did usurp;,3
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,3
And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth,3
And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth,3
From these our Henry lineally descends.,3
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost,3
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.,3
Of threescore and two years; a silly time,3
Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege,3
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?,3
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?,3
Call him my king by whose injurious doom,3
Was done to death? and more than so my father,3
When nature brought him to the door of death?,3
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.,3
Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford,3
While I use further conference with Warwick.,3
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!,3
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath,3
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.,3
The more that Henry was unfortunate.,3
Tell me for truth the measure of his love,3
Such it seems,3
Myself have often heard him say and swear,3
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,3
Exempt from envy but not from disdain,3
Now sister let us hear your firm resolve.,3
To WARWICK,3
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,3
Then Warwick thus: our sister shall be Edward's;,3
Touching the jointure that your king must make,3
Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness,3
To Edward but not to the English king.,3
By this alliance to make void my suit:,3
And still is friend to him and Margaret:,3
As may appear by Edward's good success,3
From giving aid which late I promised.,3
That your estate requires and mine can yield.,3
Where having nothing nothing can he lose.,3
You have a father able to maintain you;,3
Peace impudent and shameless Warwick peace,3
I will not hence till with my talk and tears,3
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;,3
Post blows a horn within,3
Enter a Post,3
Sent from your brother Marquess Montague:,3
These from our king unto your majesty:,3
And madam these for you; from whom I know not.,3
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress,3
Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled:,3
Warwick what are thy news? and yours fair queen?,3
Mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent.,3
And now to soothe your forgery and his,3
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?,3
I told your majesty as much before:,3
King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven,3
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,3
But most himself if he could see his shame.,3
My father came untimely to his death?,3
Did I impale him with the regal crown?,3
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?,3
And to repair my honour lost for him,3
My noble queen let former grudges pass,3
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,3
Warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love;,3
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.,3
That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us,3
I'll undertake to land them on our coast,3
Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:,3
He's very likely now to fall from him,3
Or than for strength and safety of our country.,3
But by thy help to this distressed queen?,3
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?,3
And mine fair lady Bona joins with yours.,3
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved,3
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.,3
And tell false Edward thy supposed king,3
To revel it with him and his new bride:,3
Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,3
Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,3
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,3
There's thy reward: be gone.,3
But Warwick,3
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;,3
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.,3
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?,3
That if our queen and this young prince agree,3
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.,3
Son Edward she is fair and virtuous,3
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable,3
Yes I accept her for she well deserves it;,3
He gives his hand to WARWICK,3
And thou Lord Bourbon our high admiral,3
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,3
Exeunt all but WARWICK,3
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:,3
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.,3
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.,3
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:,3
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.,3
ACT IV,3
Enter GLOUCESTER CLARENCE SOMERSET and MONTAGUE,3
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?,3
Alas you know 'tis far from hence to France;,3
My lords forbear this talk; here comes the king.,3
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.,3
Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice,3
As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,3
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.,3
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,3
And shall have your will because our king:,3
Yea brother Richard are you offended too?,3
No God forbid that I should wish them sever'd,3
To sunder them that yoke so well together.,3
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey,3
And you too Somerset and Montague,3
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis,3
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.,3
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.,3
By such invention as I can devise?,3
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth,3
Why knows not Montague that of itself,3
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.,3
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas,3
And with their helps only defend ourselves;,3
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves,3
Ay what of that? it was my will and grant;,3
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,3
Unto the brother of your loving bride;,3
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.,3
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,3
Alas poor Clarence! is it for a wife,3
In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,3
To play the broker in mine own behalf;,3
Leave me or tarry Edward will be king,3
My lords before it pleased his majesty,3
Do me but right and you must all confess,3
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.,3
So your dislike to whom I would be pleasing,3
My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns:,3
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,3
Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too,3
Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe,3
[Aside]  I hear yet say not much but think the more.,3
Now messenger what letters or what news,3
My sovereign liege no letters; and few words,3
Dare not relate.,3
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.,3
At my depart these were his very words:,3
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers,3
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.,3
These were her words utter'd with mad disdain:,3
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.',3
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?,3
Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,3
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.,3
He more incensed against your majesty,3
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,3
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?,3
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.,3
Ay gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in,3
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.,3
Now brother king farewell and sit you fast,3
That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage,3
You that love me and Warwick follow me.,3
[Aside]  Not I:,3
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.,3
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;,3
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf,3
They are already or quickly will be landed:,3
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD,3
Resolve my doubt. You twain of all the rest,3
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?,3
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:,3
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,3
So God help Montague as he proves true!,3
Now brother Richard will you stand by us?,3
Why so! then am I sure of victory.,3
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.,3
SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire.,3
Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well;,3
Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET,3
Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends?,3
Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick;,3
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart,3
Else might I think that Clarence Edward's brother,3
But welcome sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.,3
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,3
And but attended by a simple guard,3
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:,3
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,3
So we well cover'd with the night's black mantle,3
And seize himself; I say not slaughter him,3
You that will follow me to this attempt,3
They all cry 'Henry!',3
For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George!,3
SCENE III. Edward's camp near Warwick.,3
Come on my masters each man take his stand:,3
What will he not to bed?,3
Never to lie and take his natural rest,3
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,3
But say I pray what nobleman is that,3
Tis the Lord Hastings the king's chiefest friend.,3
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,3
Tis the more honour because more dangerous.,3
I like it better than a dangerous honour.,3
Tis to be doubted he would waken him.,3
Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent,3
Enter WARWICK CLARENCE OXFORD SOMERSET and French soldiers silent all,3
Courage my masters! honour now or never!,3
Who goes there?,3
WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!'  and set upon the Guard who fly crying 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them,3
What are they that fly there?,3
The duke! Why Warwick when we parted,3
Ay but the case is alter'd:,3
Then I degraded you from being king,3
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,3
Nor how to be contented with one wife,3
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,3
Yea brother of Clarence are thou here too?,3
Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance,3
Edward will always bear himself as king:,3
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.,3
Takes off his crown,3
And be true king indeed thou but the shadow.,3
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd,3
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,3
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.,3
They lead him out forcibly,3
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.,3
What now remains my lords for us to do,3
Ay that's the first thing that we have to do;,3
And see him seated in the regal throne.,3
SCENE IV. London. The palace.,3
Madam what makes you in this sudden change?,3
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?,3
No but the loss of his own royal person.,3
Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner,3
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:,3
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,3
These news I must confess are full of grief;,3
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.,3
And I the rather wean me from despair,3
This is it that makes me bridle passion,3
Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear,3
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown,3
But madam where is Warwick then become?,3
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:,3
But to prevent the tyrant's violence--,3
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,3
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.,3
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.,3
SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire.,3
Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,3
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.,3
Is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands,3
And often but attended with weak guard,3
I have advertised him by secret means,3
Under the colour of his usual game,3
To set him free from his captivity.,3
This way my lord; for this way lies the game.,3
Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest,3
Brother the time and case requireth haste:,3
But whither shall we then?,3
And ship from thence to Flanders.,3
Stanley I will requite thy forwardness.,3
Huntsman what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?,3
Come then away; let's ha' no more ado.,3
And pray that I may repossess the crown.,3
SCENE VI. London. The Tower.,3
Master lieutenant now that God and friends,3
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,3
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?,3
But if an humble prayer may prevail,3
For what lieutenant? for well using me?,3
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;,3
Conceive when after many moody thoughts,3
They quite forget their loss of liberty.,3
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;,3
Therefore that I may conquer fortune's spite,3
And that the people of this blessed land,3
Warwick although my head still wear the crown,3
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.,3
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,3
For few men rightly temper with the stars:,3
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.,3
To whom the heavens in thy nativity,3
As likely to be blest in peace and war;,3
And I choose Clarence only for protector.,3
Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts,3
I make you both protectors of this land,3
And in devotion spend my latter days,3
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?,3
For on thy fortune I repose myself.,3
We'll yoke together like a double shadow,3
I mean in bearing weight of government,3
And Clarence now then it is more than needful,3
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.,3
Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part.,3
Let me entreat for I command no more,3
Be sent for to return from France with speed;,3
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.,3
My Lord of Somerset what youth is that,3
My liege it is young Henry earl of Richmond.,3
Lays his hand on his head,3
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,3
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,3
His hand to wield a sceptre and himself,3
Make much of him my lords for this is he,3
Enter a Post,3
That Edward is escaped from your brother,3
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?,3
And the Lord Hastings who attended him,3
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;,3
My brother was too careless of his charge.,3
A salve for any sore that may betide.,3
My lord I like not of this flight of Edward's;,3
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.,3
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,3
What may befall him to his harm and ours:,3
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,3
Ay for if Edward repossess the crown,3
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.,3
Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and Soldiers,3
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,3
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.,3
And brought desired help from Burgundy:,3
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,3
The gates made fast! Brother I like not this;,3
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.,3
By fair or foul means we must enter in,3
My liege I'll knock once more to summon them.,3
My lords we were forewarned of your coming,3
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.,3
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.,3
Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,3
[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,3
Why master mayor why stand you in a doubt?,3
Ay say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.,3
A wise stout captain and soon persuaded!,3
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,3
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.,3
So master mayor: these gates must not be shut,3
What! fear not man but yield me up the keys;,3
For Edward will defend the town and thee,3
March. Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers,3
Our trusty friend unless I be deceived.,3
To help King Edward in his time of storm,3
Thanks good Montgomery; but we now forget,3
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.,3
I came to serve a king and not a duke.,3
The drum begins to march,3
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.,3
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,3
To keep them back that come to succor you:,3
Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points?,3
Till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.,3
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.,3
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.,3
And Henry but usurps the diadem.,3
And now will I be Edward's champion.,3
Come fellow-soldier make thou proclamation.,3
Edward the Fourth by the grace of God king of,3
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,3
Throws down his gauntlet,3
Thanks brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:,3
Now for this night let's harbour here in York;,3
Above the border of this horizon,3
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.,3
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!,3
Come on brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,3
Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI WARWICK MONTAGUE CLARENCE EXETER and OXFORD,3
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,3
And with his troops doth march amain to London;,3
Let's levy men and beat him back again.,3
Which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench.,3
Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war;,3
Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent,3
Thou brother Montague in Buckingham,3
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:,3
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.,3
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,3
Shall rest in London till we come to him.,3
Farewell my sovereign.,3
In sign of truth I kiss your highness' hand.,3
Comfort my lord; and so I take my leave.,3
Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague,3
Farewell sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.,3
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.,3
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field,3
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.,3
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,3
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,3
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;,3
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.,3
Then why should they love Edward more than me?,3
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,3
Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!',3
Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER and soldiers,3
And once again proclaim us King of England.,3
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,3
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.,3
And lords towards Coventry bend we our course,3
The sun shines hot; and if we use delay,3
Away betimes before his forces join,3
Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry.,3
ACT V,3
Enter WARWICK the Mayor of Coventry two Messengers and others upon the walls,3
How far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow?,3
How far off is our brother Montague?,3
By this at Daintry with a puissant troop.,3
Say Somerville what says my loving son?,3
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,3
Drum heard,3
It is not his my lord; here Southam lies:,3
Who should that be? belike unlook'd-for friends.,3
March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER and soldiers,3
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!,3
Where slept our scouts or how are they seduced,3
Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates,3
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?,3
Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence,3
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?,3
I thought at least he would have said the king;,3
Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift?,3
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.,3
Why then 'tis mine if but by Warwick's gift.,3
And weakling Warwick takes his gift again;,3
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:,3
What is the body when the head is off?,3
But whiles he thought to steal the single ten,3
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,3
Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.,3
Nay when? strike now or else the iron cools.,3
And with the other fling it at thy face,3
Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend,3
Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,3
Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.',3
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!,3
He and his forces enter the city,3
So other foes may set upon our backs.,3
Will issue out again and bid us battle:,3
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.,3
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours,3
He and his forces enter the city,3
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.,3
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.,3
Somerset Somerset for Lancaster!,3
Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset,3
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.,3
And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,3
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails,3
Come Clarence come; thou wilt if Warwick call.,3
Taking his red rose out of his hat,3
I will not ruinate my father's house,3
And set up Lancaster. Why trow'st thou Warwick,3
To bend the fatal instruments of war,3
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:,3
Than Jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter.,3
That to deserve well at my brother's hands,3
With resolution wheresoe'er I meet thee--,3
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.,3
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.,3
And Richard do not frown upon my faults,3
Now welcome more and ten times more beloved,3
Welcome good Clarence; this is brotherlike.,3
What Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight?,3
Alas I am not coop'd here for defence!,3
And bid thee battle Edward if thou darest.,3
Lords to the field; Saint George and victory!,3
SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.,3
So lie thou there: die thou and die our fear;,3
Now Montague sit fast; I seek for thee,3
Exit,3
And tell me who is victor York or Warwick?,3
My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows.,3
And by my fall the conquest to my foe.,3
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,3
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree,3
These eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,3
To search the secret treasons of the world:,3
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;,3
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?,3
My parks my walks my manors that I had.,3
Is nothing left me but my body's length.,3
And live we how we can yet die we must.,3
Ah Warwick Warwick! wert thou as we are.,3
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:,3
Why then I would not fly. Ah Montague,3
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!,3
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood,3
Come quickly Montague or I am dead.,3
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,3
And more he would have said and more he spoke,3
That mought not be distinguished; but at last,3
O farewell Warwick!',3
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.,3
Away away to meet the queen's great power!,3
SCENE III. Another part of the field.,3
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,3
But in the midst of this bright-shining day,3
That will encounter with our glorious sun,3
I mean my lords those powers that the queen,3
And as we hear march on to fight with us.,3
And blow it to the source from whence it came:,3
For every cloud engenders not a storm.,3
And Somerset with Oxford fled to her:,3
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.,3
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:,3
Will thither straight for willingness rids way;,3
In every county as we go along.,3
Exeunt,3
March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD SOMERSET OXFORD and soldiers,3
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.,3
The cable broke the holding-anchor lost,3
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he,3
With tearful eyes add water to the sea,3
Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock,3
Ah what a shame! ah what a fault were this!,3
And Montague our topmost; what of him?,3
Why is not Oxford here another anchor?,3
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?,3
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?,3
But keep our course though the rough wind say no,3
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.,3
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?,3
All these the enemies to our poor bark.,3
Tread on the sand; why there you quickly sink:,3
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.,3
If case some one of you would fly from us,3
More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks.,3
Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.,3
Should if a coward heard her speak these words,3
And make him naked foil a man at arms.,3
For did I but suspect a fearful man,3
Lest in our need he might infect another,3
If any such be here--as God forbid!--,3
Women and children of so high a courage,3
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather,3
To bear his image and renew his glories!,3
Go home to bed and like the owl by day,3
Thanks gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford thanks.,3
Enter a Messenger,3
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.,3
To haste thus fast to find us unprovided.,3
This cheers my heart to see your forwardness.,3
Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and soldiers,3
Which by the heavens' assistance and your strength,3
I need not add more fuel to your fire,3
Give signal to the fight and to it lords!,3
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,3
Therefore no more but this: Henry your sovereign,3
His realm a slaughter-house his subjects slain,3
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.,3
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.,3
SCENE V. Another part of the field.,3
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.,3
For Somerset off with his guilty head.,3
For my part I'll not trouble thee with words.,3
Exeunt Oxford and Somerset guarded,3
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.,3
Shall have a high reward and he his life?,3
Enter soldiers with PRINCE EDWARD,3
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?,3
For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects,3
Speak like a subject proud ambitious York!,3
Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou,3
Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to.,3
That you might still have worn the petticoat,3
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;,3
By heaven brat I'll plague ye for that word.,3
For God's sake take away this captive scold.,3
Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue.,3
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:,3
And thou mis-shapen Dick I tell ye all,3
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.,3
Stabs him,3
Stabs him,3
Stabs him,3
Marry and shall.,3
Hold Richard hold; for we have done too much.,3
What doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.,3
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:,3
What? what?,3
Exit,3
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!,3
Did not offend nor were not worthy blame,3
He was a man; this in respect a child:,3
What's worse than murderer that I may name it?,3
And I will speak that so my heart may burst.,3
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!,3
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:,3
Look in his youth to have him so cut off,3
Away with her; go bear her hence perforce.,3
Here sheathe thy sword I'll pardon thee my death:,3
By heaven I will not do thee so much ease.,3
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?,3
Twas sin before but now 'tis charity.,3
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard where art thou?,3
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.,3
So come to you and yours as to this Prince!,3
Where's Richard gone?,3
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.,3
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort,3
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:,3
Exeunt,3
Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER with the Lieutenant on the walls,3
Ay my good lord:--my lord I should say rather;,3
Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,3
Sirrah leave us to ourselves: we must confer.,3
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;,3
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.,3
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;,3
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,3
And I the hapless male to one sweet bird,3
Where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd.,3
That taught his son the office of a fowl!,3
I Daedalus; my poor boy Icarus;,3
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy,3
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.,3
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point,3
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?,3
A persecutor I am sure thou art:,3
Why then thou art an executioner.,3
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,3
And thus I prophesy that many a thousand,3
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,3
Men for their sons wives for their husbands,3
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.,3
The night-crow cried aboding luckless time;,3
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,3
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,3
To wit an indigested and deformed lump,3
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,3
And if the rest be true which I have heard,3
I'll hear no more: die prophet in thy speech:,3
For this amongst the rest was I ordain'd.,3
God forgive my sins and pardon thee!,3
What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster,3
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!,3
From those that wish the downfall of our house!,3
Down down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:,3
I that have neither pity love nor fear.,3
For I have often heard my mother say,3
Had I not reason think ye to make haste,3
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried,3
And so I was; which plainly signified,3
Then since the heavens have shaped my body so,3
I have no brother I am like no brother;,3
Be resident in men like one another,3
Clarence beware; thou keep'st me from the light:,3
For I will buz abroad such prophecies,3
And then to purge his fear I'll be thy death.,3
Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest,3
I'll throw thy body in another room,3
Exit with the body,3
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV QUEEN ELIZABETH  CLARENCE GLOUCESTER HASTINGS a Nurse with the young Prince and Attendants,3
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.,3
Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!,3
For hardy and undoubted champions;,3
And two Northumberlands; two braver men,3
With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague,3
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.,3
And made our footstool of security.,3
Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself,3
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,3
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.,3
For yet I am not look'd on in the world.,3
And heave it shall some weight or break my back:,3
Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen;,3
The duty that I owe unto your majesty,3
Thanks noble Clarence; worthy brother thanks.,3
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.,3
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.,3
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.,3
Reignier her father to the king of France,3
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.,3
And now what rests but that we spend the time,3
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?,3
For here I hope begins our lasting joy.,3
ACT I,4
Enter BERTRAM the COUNTESS of Rousillon HELENA and LAFEU all in black,4
And I in going madam weep o'er my father's death,4
whom I am now in ward evermore in subjection.,4
sir a father: he that so generally is at all times,4
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather,4
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?,4
practises he hath persecuted time with hope and,4
losing of hope by time.,4
had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was,4
far would have made nature immortal and death,4
king's sake he were living! I think it would be,4
How called you the man you speak of madam?,4
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.,4
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he,4
could be set up against mortality.,4
A fistula my lord.,4
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman,4
His sole child my lord and bequeathed to my,4
her education promises; her dispositions she,4
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there,4
traitors too; in her they are the better for their,4
Your commendations madam get from her tears.,4
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches,4
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this Helena;,4
a sorrow than have it.,4
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,4
If the living be enemy to the grief the excess,4
Madam I desire your holy wishes.,4
Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father,4
Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness,4
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy,4
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,4
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,4
Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,4
He cannot want the best,4
Heaven bless him! Farewell Bertram.,4
[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in,4
to my mother your mistress and make much of her.,4
your father.,4
O were that all! I think not on my father;,4
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?,4
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.,4
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one,4
And think to wed it he is so above me:,4
Must I be comforted not in his sphere.,4
The hind that would be mated by the lion,4
To see him every hour; to sit and draw,4
In our heart's table; heart too capable,4
But now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;,4
Think him a great way fool solely a coward;,4
That they take place when virtue's steely bones,4
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.,4
And you monarch!,4
And no.,4
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me,4
may we barricado it against him?,4
But he assails; and our virginity though valiant,4
warlike resistance.,4
undermine you and blow you up.,4
blowers up! Is there no military policy how,4
Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be,4
the breach yourselves made you lose your city. It,4

virginity was first lost. That you were made of is,4
may be ten times found; by being ever kept it is,4
I will stand for 't a little though therefore I die a virgin.,4
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,4
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:,4
highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate,4
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very,4
Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of,4

How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking?,4

while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.,4
of fashion: richly suited but unsuitable: just,4
now. Your date is better in your pie and your,4
your old virginity is like one of our French,4
tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;,4
Not my virginity yet [         ],4
A mother and a mistress and a friend,4
A guide a goddess and a sovereign,4
His humble ambition proud humility,4
His faith his sweet disaster; with a world,4
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--,4
The court's a learning place and he is one--,4
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--,4
That wishing well had not a body in't,4
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,4
And show what we alone must think which never,4

will think of thee at court.,4
Under Mars I.,4
Why under Mars?,4

When he was retrograde I think rather.,4
You go so much backward when you fight.,4
So is running away when fear proposes the safety;,4
in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear well.,4

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,4
Gives us free scope only doth backward pull,4
What power is it which mounts my love so high,4
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings,4
Impossible be strange attempts to those,4

Exit,4
Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France with letters and divers Attendants,4
Have fought with equal fortune and continue,4
So 'tis reported sir.,4
A certainty vouch'd from our cousin Austria,4
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend,4
To have us make denial.,4
Approved so to your majesty may plead,4
He hath arm'd our answer,4
Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see,4
To stand on either part.,4
A nursery to our gentry who are sick,4
What's he comes here?,4
It is the Count Rousillon my good lord,4
Youth thou bear'st thy father's face;,4
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts,4
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.,4
As when thy father and myself in friendship,4
Into the service of the time and was,4
But on us both did haggish age steal on,4
To talk of your good father. In his youth,4
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest,4
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;,4
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,4
Clock to itself knew the true minute when,4
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him,4
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,4
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man,4
Which follow'd well would demonstrate them now,4
His good remembrance sir,4
So in approof lives not his epitaph,4
Would I were with him! He would always say--,4
He scatter'd not in ears but grafted them,4
This his good melancholy oft began,4
When it was out--'Let me not live' quoth he,4
Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses,4
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies,4
I after him do after him wish too,4
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,4
You are loved sir:,4
I fill a place I know't. How long is't count,4
He was much famed.,4
If he were living I would try him yet.,4
With several applications; nature and sickness,4
My son's no dearer.,4
Exeunt. Flourish,4
Enter COUNTESS Steward and Clown,4
Madam the care I have had to even your content I,4
endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make,4
ourselves we publish them.,4
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all,4
you lack not folly to commit them and have ability,4
Tis not unknown to you madam I am a poor fellow.,4
No madam 'tis not so well that I am poor though,4
your ladyship's good will to go to the world Isbel,4
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?,4
In what case?,4
heritage: and I think I shall never have the,4
they say barnes are blessings.,4
My poor body madam requires it: I am driven on,4
Is this all your worship's reason?,4
are.,4
I have been madam a wicked creature as you and,4
that I may repent.,4
I am out o' friends madam; and I hope to have,4
Such friends are thine enemies knave.,4
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.,4
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold he's my,4
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh,4
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo he that kisses,4
be what they are there were no fear in marriage;,4
Papist howsome'er their hearts are severed in,4
horns together like any deer i' the herd.,4
A prophet I madam; and I speak the truth the next,4
For I the ballad will repeat,4
Your marriage comes by destiny,4
Get you gone sir; I'll talk with you more anon.,4
you: of her I am to speak.,4
Helen I mean.,4
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?,4
Was this King Priam's joy?,4
With that she sighed as she stood,4
Among nine bad if one be good,4
There's yet one good in ten.,4
One good woman in ten madam; which is a purifying,4
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,4
might have a good woman born but one every blazing,4
well: a man may draw his heart out ere a' pluck,4
You'll be gone sir knave and do as I command you.,4
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan yet it,4
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am,4
Exit,4
I know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely.,4
she herself without other advantage may lawfully,4
more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid,4
Madam I was very late more near her than I think,4
to herself her own words to her own ears; she,4
stranger sense. Her matter was she loved your son:,4
such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no,4
qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins that,4
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.,4
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I,4
sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns,4
You have discharged this honestly; keep it to,4
before which hung so tottering in the balance that,4
leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you,4
Exit Steward,4
Even so it was with me when I was young:,4
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;,4
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,4
By our remembrances of days foregone,4
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.,4
You know Helen,4
Mine honourable mistress.,4
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother',4
That you start at it? I say I am your mother;,4
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen,4
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:,4
Yet I express to you a mother's care:,4
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,4
The many-colour'd Iris rounds thine eye?,4
That I am not.,4
Pardon madam;,4
I am from humble he from honour'd name;,4
My master my dear lord he is; and I,4
He must not be my brother.,4
You are my mother madam; would you were--,4
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,4
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,4
Yes Helen you might be my daughter-in-law:,4
So strive upon your pulse. What pale again?,4
The mystery of your loneliness and find,4
You love my son; invention is ashamed,4
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;,4
Confess it th' one to th' other; and thine eyes,4
That in their kind they speak it: only sin,4
That truth should be suspected. Speak is't so?,4
If it be not forswear't: howe'er I charge thee,4
Tell me truly.,4
Do you love my son?,4
Love you my son?,4
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,4
The state of your affection; for your passions,4
Then I confess,4
That before you and next unto high heaven,4
My friends were poor but honest; so's my love:,4
That he is loved of me: I follow him not,4
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;,4
I know I love in vain strive against hope;,4
I still pour in the waters of my love,4
Religious in mine error I adore,4
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,4
For loving where you do: but if yourself,4
Did ever in so true a flame of liking,4
Was both herself and love: O then give pity,4
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;,4
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!,4
To go to Paris?,4
Wherefore? tell true.,4
You know my father left me some prescriptions,4
And manifest experience had collected,4
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,4
More than they were in note: amongst the rest,4
To cure the desperate languishings whereof,4
This was your motive,4
My lord your son made me to think of this;,4
Had from the conversation of my thoughts,4
But think you Helen,4
He would receive it? he and his physicians,4
They that they cannot help: how shall they credit,4
Embowell'd of their doctrine have left off,4
There's something in't,4
Of his profession that his good receipt,4
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and would your honour,4
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure,4
Dost thou believe't?,4
Why Helen thou shalt have my leave and love,4
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home,4
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,4
Exeunt,4
SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.,4
Farewell young lords; these warlike principles,4
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,4
And is enough for both.,4
After well enter'd soldiers to return,4
No no it cannot be; and yet my heart,4
That doth my life besiege. Farewell young lords;,4
Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy--,4
Of the last monarchy--see that you come,4
The bravest questant shrinks find what you seek,4
Health at your bidding serve your majesty!,4
They say our French lack language to deny,4
Before you serve.,4
Farewell. Come hither to me.,4
O my sweet lord that you will stay behind us!,4
O 'tis brave wars!,4
I am commanded here and kept a coil with,4
An thy mind stand to't boy steal away bravely.,4
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,4
But one to dance with! By heaven I'll steal away.,4
Commit it count.,4
I grow to you and our parting is a tortured body.,4
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!,4
sparks and lustrous a word good metals: you shall,4
Spurio with his cicatrice an emblem of war here,4
entrenched it: say to him I live; and observe his,4
We shall noble captain.,4
Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?,4
Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire,4
noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the,4
them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the,4
move under the influence of the most received star;,4
be followed: after them and take a more dilated farewell.,4
Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.,4
Enter LAFEU,4
I'll fee thee to stand up.,4
I would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy,4
I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,4
Good faith across: but my good lord 'tis thus;,4
No.,4
Yes but you will my noble grapes an if,4
That's able to breathe life into a stone,4
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,4
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,4
What 'her' is this?,4
If you will see her: now by my faith and honour,4
In this my light deliverance I have spoke,4
Wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more,4
For that is her demand and know her business?,4
Now good Lafeu,4
May spend our wonder too or take off thine,4
Nay I'll fit you,4
Exit,4
Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA,4
This haste hath wings indeed.,4
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:,4
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,4
Exit,4
Ay my good lord.,4
In what he did profess well found.,4
The rather will I spare my praises towards him:,4
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.,4
And of his old experience the oily darling,4
Safer than mine own two more dear; I have so;,4
With that malignant cause wherein the honour,4
I come to tender it and my appliance,4
We thank you maiden;,4
When our most learned doctors leave us and,4
That labouring art can never ransom nature,4
So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope,4
To empirics or to dissever so,4
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.,4
I will no more enforce mine office on you.,4
A modest one to bear me back again.,4
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give,4
But what at full I know thou know'st no part,4
What I can do can do no hurt to try,4
He that of greatest works is finisher,4
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,4
From simple sources and great seas have dried,4
Oft expectation fails and most oft there,4
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.,4
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:,4
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:,4
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;,4
The help of heaven we count the act of men.,4
Of heaven not me make an experiment.,4
Myself against the level of mine aim;,4
My art is not past power nor you past cure.,4
Hopest thou my cure?,4
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring,4
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp,4
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass,4
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,4
Upon thy certainty and confidence,4
Tax of impudence,4
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name,4
With vilest torture let my life be ended.,4
His powerful sound within an organ weak:,4
In common sense sense saves another way.,4
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,4
That happiness and prime can happy call:,4
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.,4
That ministers thine own death if I die.,4
Of what I spoke unpitied let me die,4
But if I help what do you promise me?,4
But will you make it even?,4
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand,4
Exempted be from me the arrogance,4
My low and humble name to propagate,4
But such a one thy vassal whom I know,4
Here is my hand; the premises observed,4
So make the choice of thy own time for I,4
More should I question thee and more I must,4
From whence thou camest how tended on: but rest,4
Give me some help here ho! If thou proceed,4
Flourish. Exeunt,4
Enter COUNTESS and Clown,4
your breeding.,4
know my business is but to the court.,4
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!,4
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make,4
has neither leg hands lip nor cap; and indeed,4
court; but for me I have an answer will serve all,4
Marry that's a bountiful answer that fits all,4
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,4
buttock or any buttock.,4
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,4
rush for Tom's forefinger as a pancake for Shrove,4
hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen,4
friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin.,4
questions?,4
will fit any question.,4
must fit all demands.,4
should speak truth of it: here it is and all that,4
do you no harm to learn.,4
question hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I,4
O Lord sir! There's a simple putting off. More,4
Sir I am a poor friend of yours that loves you.,4
I think sir you can eat none of this homely meat.,4
You were lately whipped sir as I think.,4
Do you cry 'O Lord sir!' at your whipping and,4
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well,4
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,4
I play the noble housewife with the time,4
O Lord sir! why there't serves well again.,4
And urge her to a present answer back:,4
This is not much.,4
Not much employment for you: you understand me?,4
Haste you again.,4
SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.,4
They say miracles are past; and we have our,4
things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that,4
into seeming knowledge when we should submit,4
Why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath,4
And so 'tis.,4
So I say.,4
So I say.,4
Right; so I say.,4
Why there 'tis; so say I too.,4
Right; as 'twere a man assured of a--,4
Just you say well; so would I have said.,4
It is indeed: if you will have it in showing you,4
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.,4
Why your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,4
Nay 'tis strange 'tis very strange that is the,4
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--,4
Ay so I say.,4
pausing,4
transcendence: which should indeed give us a,4
the king as to be--,4
generally thankful.,4
Enter KING HELENA and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire,4
better whilst I have a tooth in my head: why he's,4
Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?,4
Go call before me all the lords in court.,4
And with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense,4
The confirmation of my promised gift,4
Enter three or four Lords,4
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,4
I have to use: thy frank election make;,4
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress,4
I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,4
And writ as little beard.,4
Not one of those but had a noble father.,4
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.,4
I am a simple maid and therein wealthiest,4
Please it your majesty I have done already:,4
We blush that thou shouldst choose; but be refused,4
We'll ne'er come there again.',4
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.,4
And to imperial Love that god most high,4
And grant it.,4
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace,4
The honour sir that flames in your fair eyes,4
Love make your fortunes twenty times above,4
No better if you please.,4
Which great Love grant! and so I take my leave.,4
I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the,4
Be not afraid that I your hand should take;,4
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed,4
These boys are boys of ice they'll none have her:,4
ne'er got 'em.,4
To make yourself a son out of my blood.,4
There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk,4
of fourteen; I have known thee already.,4
Me and my service ever whilst I live,4
Why then young Bertram take her; she's thy wife.,4
In such a business give me leave to use,4
Know'st thou not Bertram,4
Yes my good lord;,4
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.,4
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:,4
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain,4
Tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which,4
Of colour weight and heat pour'd all together,4
In differences so mighty. If she be,4
A poor physician's daughter thou dislikest,4
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,4
Where great additions swell's and virtue none,4
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:,4
Not by the title. She is young wise fair;,4
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,4
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,4
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave,4
A lying trophy and as oft is dumb,4
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?,4
I can create the rest: virtue and she,4
I cannot love her nor will strive to do't.,4
That you are well restored my lord I'm glad:,4
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,4
Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift;,4
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,4
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,4
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:,4
Believe not thy disdain but presently,4
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;,4
Into the staggers and the careless lapse,4
Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,4
Pardon my gracious lord; for I submit,4
What great creation and what dole of honour,4
Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now,4
Is as 'twere born so.,4
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise,4
A balance more replete.,4
Good fortune and the favour of the king,4
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,4
Shall more attend upon the coming space,4
Thy love's to me religious; else does err.,4
[Advancing]  Do you hear monsieur? a word with you.,4
Your lord and master did well to make his,4
Recantation! My lord! my master!,4
A most harsh one and not to be understood without,4
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?,4
To what is count's man: count's master is of,4
You are too old sir; let it satisfy you you are too old.,4
title age cannot bring thee.,4
I did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty,4
travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the,4
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I,4
not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and,4
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee--,4
hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee,4
well: thy casement I need not open for I look,4
My lord you give me most egregious indignity.,4
I have not my lord deserved it.,4
bate thee a scruple.,4
Even as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at,4
in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is,4
my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge,4
My lord you do me most insupportable vexation.,4
doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by,4
Exit,4

I'll beat him by my life if I can meet him with,4

Re-enter LAFEU,4
for you: you have a new mistress.,4
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good,4
Who? God?,4
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou,4
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set,4
honour if I were but two hours younger I'ld beat,4
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast,4
This is hard and undeserved measure my lord.,4
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and,4
and honourable personages than the commission of your,4
worth another word else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.,4
Good very good; it is so then: good very good;,4
Re-enter BERTRAM,4
What's the matter sweet-heart?,4
I will not bed her.,4
O my Parolles they have married me!,4
France is a dog-hole and it no more merits,4
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,4
Ay that would be known. To the wars my boy to the wars!,4
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,4
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet,4
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;,4
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,4
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king,4
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,4
To the dark house and the detested wife.,4
Go with me to my chamber and advise me.,4
I'll to the wars she to her single sorrow.,4
A young man married is a man that's marr'd:,4
The king has done you wrong: but hush 'tis so.,4
SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.,4
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?,4
very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be,4
world; but yet she is not well.,4
not very well?,4
What two things?,4
quickly! the other that she's in earth from whence,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
I hope sir I have your good will to have mine own,4
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them,4
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,4
Why I say nothing.,4
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say,4
nothing is to be a great part of your title; which,4
Away! thou'rt a knave.,4
knave; that's before me thou'rt a knave: this had,4
Go to thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.,4
taught to find me? The search sir was profitable;,4
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.,4
Madam my lord will go away to-night;,4
The great prerogative and rite of love,4
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;,4
Which they distil now in the curbed time,4
And pleasure drown the brim.,4
That you will take your instant leave o' the king,4
Strengthen'd with what apology you think,4
What more commands he?,4
Attend his further pleasure.,4
I shall report it so.,4
Exit PAROLLES,4
Exeunt,4
Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM,4
Yes my lord and of very valiant approof.,4
And by other warranted testimony.,4
I do assure you my lord he is very great in,4
I have then sinned against his experience and,4
way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my,4

soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in,4
tame and know their natures. Farewell monsieur:,4
deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.,4
An idle lord. I swear.,4
Why do you not know him?,4
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.,4
I have sir as I was commanded from you,4
For present parting; only he desires,4
I shall obey his will.,4
Which holds not colour with the time nor does,4
On my particular. Prepared I was not,4
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you,4
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,4
And my appointments have in them a need,4
To you that know them not. This to my mother:,4
Twill be two days ere I shall see you so,4
Sir I can nothing say,4
Come come no more of that.,4
With true observance seek to eke out that,4
To equal my great fortune.,4
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.,4
Well what would you say?,4
Nor dare I say 'tis mine and yet it is;,4
What law does vouch mine own.,4
Something; and scarce so much: nothing indeed.,4
Faith yes;,4
I pray you stay not but in haste to horse.,4
Where are my other men monsieur? Farewell.,4
Go thou toward home; where I will never come,4
Away and for our flight.,4
Exeunt,4
SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace.,4
So that from point to point now have you heard,4
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth,4
Holy seems the quarrel,4
On the opposer.,4
Would in so just a business shut his bosom,4
Good my lord,4
But like a common and an outward man,4
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not,4
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail,4
Be it his pleasure.,4
That surfeit on their ease will day by day,4
Welcome shall they be;,4
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;,4
To-morrow to the field.,4

in the world I will hold a long distance. My duty,4
BERTRAM.,4
To fly the favours of so good a king;,4
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous,4
Re-enter Clown,4
soldiers and my young lady!,4
Nay there is some comfort in the news some,4
thought he would.,4
So say I madam if he run away as I hear he does:,4
men though it be the getting of children. Here,4

Enter HELENA and two Gentlemen,4
Madam my lord is gone for ever gone.,4
Think upon patience. Pray you gentlemen,4
That the first face of neither on the start,4
Madam he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:,4
And after some dispatch in hand at court,4
Look on his letter madam; here's my passport.,4
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which,4
of thy body that I am father to then call me,4
This is a dreadful sentence.,4
Ay madam;,4
I prithee lady have a better cheer;,4
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;,4
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?,4
And to be a soldier?,4
The duke will lay upon him all the honour,4
Return you thither?,4
[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.,4
Find you that there?,4
Tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his,4
Nothing in France until he have no wife!,4
But only she; and she deserves a lord,4
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?,4
Which I have sometime known.,4
Ay my good lady he.,4
My son corrupts a well-derived nature,4
Indeed good lady,4
Which holds him much to have.,4
I will entreat you when you see my son,4
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you,4
We serve you madam,4
Not so but as we change our courtesies.,4
Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen,4
Nothing in France until he has no wife!,4
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I,4
Those tender limbs of thine to the event,4
That drive thee from the sportive court where thou,4
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,4
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,4
Whoever shoots at him I set him there;,4
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;,4
His death was so effected: better 'twere,4
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere,4
Were mine at once. No come thou home Rousillon,4
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;,4
Shall I stay here to do't?  no no although,4
And angels officed all: I will be gone,4
To consolate thine ear. Come night; end day!,4

Alas! and would you take the letter of her?,4
By sending me a letter? Read it again.,4

Bless him at home in peace whilst I from far,4
His taken labours bid him me forgive;,4
From courtly friends with camping foes to live,4
He is too good and fair for death and me:,4
Ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words!,4
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,4
Which thus she hath prevented.,4
If I had given you this at over-night,4
Pursuit would be but vain.,4
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,4
And loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath,4
To this unworthy husband of his wife;,4
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.,4
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:,4
He will return; and hope I may that she,4
Led hither by pure love: which of them both,4

But till the troops come by,4

I thank you and will stay upon your leisure.,4
I did so.,4
That has done worthy service.,4
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?,4
His face I know not.,4
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,4
Against his liking: think you it is so?,4
There is a gentleman that serves the count,4
What's his name?,4
O I believe with him,4
Of the great count himself she is too mean,4
Is a reserved honesty and that,4
Alas poor lady!,4
Of a detesting lord.,4
Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her,4
How do you mean?,4
In the unlawful purpose.,4
And brokes with all that can in such a suit,4
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard,4
The gods forbid else!,4
Drum and Colours,4
That is Antonio the duke's eldest son;,4
Which is the Frenchman?,4
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.,4
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?,4

Worthy the note.,4
Exeunt,4
Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords,4

more in your respect.,4
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?,4
without any malice but to speak of him as my,4
endless liar an hourly promise-breaker the owner,4
entertainment.,4
his virtue which he hath not he might at some,4
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.,4
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.,4
surprise him; such I will have whom I am sure he,4
him so that he shall suppose no other but that he,4
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship,4
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of,4
intelligence in his power against you and that with,4
trust my judgment in any thing.,4
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your,4

entertainment your inclining cannot be removed.,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch,4
How now monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your,4
A pox on't let it go; 'tis but a drum.,4
There was excellent command--to charge in with our,4
That was not to be blamed in the command of the,4

Well we cannot greatly condemn our success: some,4
not to be recovered.,4
It might; but it is not now.,4
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact,4

think your mystery in stratagem can bring this,4
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will,4
speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it.,4
greatness even to the utmost syllable of your,4
By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it.,4
I'll about it this evening: and I will presently,4
certainty put myself into my mortal preparation;,4
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?,4
the attempt I vow.,4
thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.,4
Exit,4
strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems,4
be done; damns himself to do and dares better be,4
You do not know him my lord as we do: certain it,4
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but,4
Why do you think he will make no deed at all of,4
None in the world; but return with an invention and,4
have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall,4
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case,4
when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a,4
very night.,4
Your brother he shall go along with me.,4
Exit,4
The lass I spoke of.,4
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once,4
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,4
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:,4
With all my heart my lord.,4
SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.,4
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,4
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.,4
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;,4
In any staining act.,4
First give me trust the count he is my husband,4
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,4
Err in bestowing it.,4
For you have show'd me that which well approves,4
Take this purse of gold,4
Which I will over-pay and pay again,4
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,4
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.,4
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,4
From son to son some four or five descents,4
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,4
Howe'er repented after.,4
The bottom of your purpose.,4
But that your daughter ere she seems as won,4
In fine delivers me to fill the time,4
To marry her I'll add three thousand crowns,4
I have yielded:,4
That time and place with this deceit so lawful,4
With musics of all sorts and songs composed,4
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists,4
Why then to-night,4
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,4
Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact:,4
Exeunt,4
SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.,4
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.,4
language you will: though you understand it not,4
understand him unless some one among us whom we,4
Good captain let me be the interpreter.,4
No sir I warrant you.,4
E'en such as you speak to me.,4
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of,4
one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we,4
know straight our purpose: choughs' language,4
interpreter you must seem very politic. But couch,4
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.,4
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be,4
done? It must be a very plausive invention that,4
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find,4
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not,4
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue,4
What the devil should move me to undertake the,4
impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose? I,4
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they,4
ones I dare not give. Wherefore what's the,4
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of,4
Is it possible he should know what he is and be,4
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the,4
We cannot afford you so.,4
stratagem.,4
Or to drown my clothes and say I was stripped.,4
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.,4
Thirty fathom.,4
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear,4
You shall hear one anon.,4
Alarum within,4
Cargo cargo cargo villiando par corbo cargo.,4
They seize and blindfold him,4
I know you are the Muskos' regiment:,4
If there be here German or Dane low Dutch,4
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.,4
thy tongue. Kerely bonto sir betake thee to thy,4
O!,4
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.,4
And hoodwink'd as thou art will lead thee on,4
Something to save thy life.,4
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,4
Which you will wonder at.,4
If I do not damn me.,4
Come on; thou art granted space.,4
Go tell the Count Rousillon and my brother,4
Till we do hear from them.,4
A' will betray us all unto ourselves:,4
So I will sir.,4
Exeunt,4
Enter BERTRAM and DIANA,4
No my good lord Diana.,4
And worth it with addition! But fair soul,4
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,4
When you are dead you should be such a one,4
And now you should be as your mother was,4
She then was honest.,4
No:,4
As you owe to your wife.,4
I prithee do not strive against my vows:,4
By love's own sweet constraint and will for ever,4
Ay so you serve us,4
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,4
How have I sworn!,4
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.,4
But take the High'st to witness: then pray you tell me,4
I loved you dearly would you believe my oaths,4
To swear by him whom I protest to love,4
Are words and poor conditions but unseal'd,4
Change it change it;,4
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts,4
But give thyself unto my sick desires,4
My love as it begins shall so persever.,4
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.,4
To give it from me.,4
It is an honour 'longing to our house,4
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world,4
Mine honour's such a ring:,4
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;,4
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom,4
Against your vain assault.,4
My house mine honour yea my life be thine,4
When midnight comes knock at my chamber-window:,4
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,4
Remain there but an hour nor speak to me:,4
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:,4
Another ring that what in time proceeds,4
Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won,4
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.,4
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!,4
My mother told me just how he would woo,4
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me,4
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,4
Only in this disguise I think't no sin,4
Exit,4
Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers,4
I have delivered it an hour since: there is,4
reading it he changed almost into another man.,4
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.,4
displeasure of the king who had even tuned his,4
thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.,4
grave of it.,4
Florence of a most chaste renown; and this night he,4
given her his monumental ring and thinks himself,4
Now God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,4
Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course,4
themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends,4
nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself.,4
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his,4
Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.,4
his company anatomized that he might take a measure,4
set this counterfeit.,4
presence must be the whip of the other.,4
I hear there is an overture of peace.,4
What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel,4
I perceive by this demand you are not altogether,4
Let it be forbid sir; so should I be a great deal,4
Sir his wife some two months since fled from his,4
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere,4
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her,4
now she sings in heaven.,4
The stronger part of it by her own letters which,4
death: her death itself which could not be her,4
the rector of the place.,4
Ay and the particular confirmations point from,4
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.,4
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain,4
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered,4
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and,4
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would,4
Enter a Messenger,4
He met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath,4
morning for France. The duke hath offered him,4
They shall be no more than needful there if they,4
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.,4
Enter BERTRAM,4
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses a,4
I have congied with the duke done my adieu with his,4
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;,4
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest but,4
If the business be of any difficulty and this,4
your lordship.,4
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this,4
bring forth this counterfeit module he has deceived,4
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,4
No matter: his heels have deserved it in usurping,4
I have told your lordship already the stocks carry,4
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he,4
to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to,4
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?,4
His confession is taken and it shall be read to his,4
are you must have the patience to hear it.,4
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of,4
Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa,4
without 'em?,4
ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more.,4
Boblibindo chicurmurco.,4
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.,4
[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the,4
Five or six thousand; but very weak and,4
the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation,4
Shall I set down your answer so?,4
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!,4
Parolles the gallant militarist--that was his own,4
knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of,4

He's very near the truth in this.,4

Well that's set down.,4
rogues are marvellous poor.,4

their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces.,4
Nothing but let him have thanks. Demand of him my,4
Well that's set down.,4
You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain,4
with the duke; what his valour honesty and,4
possible with well-weighing sums of gold to,4
do you know of it?,4
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.,4
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,4
fool with child--a dumb innocent that could not,4
Nay by your leave hold your hands; though I know,4
Well is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?,4
Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your,4
What is his reputation with the duke?,4
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him,4
Marry we'll search.,4
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters,4
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?,4
Our interpreter does it well.,4
[Reads]  'Dian the count's a fool and full of gold'--,4
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one,4
Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very,4
Nay I'll read it first by your favour.,4
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be,4
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.,4
[Reads]  'When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it;,4
Half won is match well made; match and well make it;,4
And say a soldier Dian told thee this,4
For count of this the count's a fool I know it,4
Thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear,4
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme,4
This is your devoted friend sir the manifold,4
I could endure any thing before but a cat and now,4
I perceive sir by the general's looks we shall be,4
My life sir in any case: not that I am afraid to,4
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,4
We'll see what may be done so you confess freely;,4

He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister: for,4
professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he,4
such volubility that you would think truth were a,4

know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but,4
every thing that an honest man should not have; what,4
I begin to love him for this.,4
him for me he's more and more a cat.,4
Faith sir he has led the drum before the English,4
his soldiership I know not; except in that country,4
called Mile-end to instruct for the doubling of,4
this I am not certain.,4
rarity redeems him.,4
His qualities being at this poor price I need not,4
Sir for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple,4
entail from all remainders and a perpetual,4

What's he?,4

I'll whisper with the general and know his pleasure.,4
drums! Only to seem to deserve well and to,4
the count have I run into this danger. Yet who,4
There is no remedy sir but you must die: the,4
discovered the secrets of your army and made such,4
serve the world for no honest use; therefore you,4
O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death!,4
Unblinding him,4
Good morrow noble captain.,4
God save you noble captain.,4
I am for France.,4
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?,4
but fare you well.,4
You are undone captain all but your scarf; that,4
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?,4
that had received so much shame you might begin an,4
too: we shall speak of you there.,4
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,4
But I will eat and drink and sleep as soft,4
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,4
that every braggart shall be found an ass.,4
Safest in shame! being fool'd by foolery thrive!,4
I'll after them.,4
SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.,4
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,4
Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,4
Time was I did him a desired office,4
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,4
His grace is at Marseilles; to which place,4
I am supposed dead: the army breaking,4
And by the leave of my good lord the king,4
Gentle madam,4
Your business was more welcome.,4
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour,4
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,4
And helper to a husband. But O strange men!,4
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts,4
With what it loathes for that which is away.,4
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer,4
Let death and honesty,4
Upon your will to suffer.,4
But with the word the time will bring on summer,4
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;,4
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;,4
Exeunt,4
Enter COUNTESS LAFEU and Clown,4
fellow there whose villanous saffron would have,4
his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at,4

most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had,4
flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother I,4
Twas a good lady 'twas a good lady: we may pick a,4
Indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the,4
They are not herbs you knave; they are nose-herbs.,4
skill in grass.,4
A fool sir at a woman's service and a knave at a man's.,4
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.,4
And I would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service.,4
At your service.,4
Why sir if I cannot serve you I can serve as,4
Who's that? a Frenchman?,4
is more hotter in France than there.,4
The black prince sir; alias the prince of,4
Hold thee there's my purse: I give thee not this,4
serve him still.,4
great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a,4
world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for,4
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble,4
tender and they'll be for the flowery way that,4
Go thy ways I begin to be aweary of thee; and I,4
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well,4
If I put any tricks upon 'em sir they shall be,4
Exit,4
So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much,4
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,4
I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to,4
that my lord your son was upon his return home I,4
my daughter; which in the minority of them both,4
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do,4
conceived against your son there is no fitter,4
With very much content my lord; and I wish it,4
His highness comes post from Marseilles of as able,4
to-morrow or I am deceived by him that in such,4
It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I,4
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain,4
Madam I was thinking with what manners I might,4
You need but plead your honourable privilege.,4
thank my God it holds yet.,4
O madam yonder's my lord your son with a patch of,4
or no the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of,4
half but his right cheek is worn bare.,4

Let us go see your son I pray you: I long to talk,4

Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:,4
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,4
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;,4

And you.,4

From the report that goes upon your goodness;,4
Which lay nice manners by I put you to,4

The king's not here.,4
Not indeed:,4
Than is his use.,4
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,4
I do beseech you whither is he gone?,4
Whither I am going.,4
Since you are like to see the king before me,4
Which I presume shall render you no blame,4
I will come after you with what good speed,4
This I'll do for you.,4
Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.,4
Exeunt,4

And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to,4
knave with fortune that she should scratch you who,4

I am for other business.,4
You beg a single penny more: come you shall ha't;,4
My name my good lord is Parolles.,4
give me your hand. How does your drum?,4
Was I in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.,4
for you did bring me out.,4
both the office of God and the devil? One brings,4
Trumpets sound,4
inquire further after me; I had talk of you last,4
eat; go to follow.,4
Exeunt,4
Flourish. Enter KING COUNTESS LAFEU the two French Lords with Attendants,4
Was made much poorer by it: but your son,4
Her estimation home.,4
And I beseech your majesty to make it,4
When oil and fire too strong for reason's force,4
My honour'd lady,4
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,4
This I must say,4
Did to his majesty his mother and his lady,4
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife,4
Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive,4
Humbly call'd mistress.,4
Makes the remembrance dear. Well call him hither;,4
All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;,4
And deeper than oblivion we do bury,4
A stranger no offender; and inform him,4
I shall my liege.,4
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?,4
Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me,4
Enter BERTRAM,4
I am not a day of season,4
In me at once: but to the brightest beams,4
The time is fair again.,4
Dear sovereign pardon to me.,4
Not one word more of the consumed time.,4
For we are old and on our quick'st decrees,4
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember,4
Admiringly my liege at first,4
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue,4
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,4
Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stolen;,4
To a most hideous object: thence it came,4
Since I have lost have loved was in mine eye,4
Well excused:,4
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,4
To the great sender turns a sour offence,4
Make trivial price of serious things we have,4
Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust,4
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,4
Be this sweet Helen's knell and now forget her.,4
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay,4
Which better than the first O dear heaven bless!,4
Come on my son in whom my house's name,4
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,4
BERTRAM gives a ring,4
And every hair that's on't Helen that's dead,4
The last that e'er I took her at court,4
Hers it was not.,4
While I was speaking oft was fasten'd to't.,4
I bade her if her fortunes ever stood,4
I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave,4
Of what should stead her most?,4
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,4
Son on my life,4
At her life's rate.,4
You are deceived my lord; she never saw it:,4
Wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name,4
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed,4
I could not answer in that course of honour,4
In heavy satisfaction and would never,4
Plutus himself,4
Hath not in nature's mystery more science,4
Whoever gave it you. Then if you know,4
Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement,4
That she would never put it from her finger,4
Where you have never come or sent it us,4
She never saw it.,4
And makest conjectural fears to come into me,4
That thou art so inhuman--'twill not prove so;--,4
And she is dead; which nothing but to close,4
More than to see this ring. Take him away.,4
My fore-past proofs howe'er the matter fall,4
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!,4
If you shall prove,4
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,4
Exit guarded,4
Enter a Gentleman,4
Whether I have been to blame or no I know not:,4
Who hath for four or five removes come short,4
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech,4
Is here attending: her business looks in her,4
In a sweet verbal brief it did concern,4
[Reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me,4
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows,4
stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow,4
king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer,4
DIANA CAPILET.,4
this: I'll none of him.,4
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:,4
I am afeard the life of Helen lady,4
Now justice on the doers!,4
I wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you,4
Yet you desire to marry.,4
What woman's that?,4
Derived from the ancient Capilet:,4
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.,4
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,4
Come hither count; do you know these women?,4
But that I know them: do they charge me further?,4
She's none of mine my lord.,4
You give away this hand and that is mine;,4
You give away myself which is known mine;,4
That she which marries you must marry me,4
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you,4
My lord this is a fond and desperate creature,4
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour,4
Sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend,4
Than in my thought it lies.,4
Ask him upon his oath if he does think,4
What say'st thou to her?,4
And was a common gamester to the camp.,4
He might have bought me at a common price:,4
Whose high respect and rich validity,4
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,4
He blushes and 'tis it:,4
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,4
That ring's a thousand proofs.,4
You saw one here in court could witness it.,4
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.,4
Find him and bring him hither.,4
What of him?,4
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;,4
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,4
She hath that ring of yours.,4
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:,4
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,4
Are motives of more fancy; and in fine,4
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;,4
At market-price have bought.,4
You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,4
Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband;,4
And give me mine again.,4
What ring was yours I pray you?,4
The same upon your finger.,4
And this was it I gave him being abed.,4
Out of a casement.,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
You boggle shrewdly every feather stars you.,4
Ay my lord.,4
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,4
By him and by this woman here what know you?,4
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,4
Come come to the purpose: did he love this woman?,4
How I pray you?,4
How is that?,4
As thou art a knave and no knave. What an,4
I am a poor man and at your majesty's command.,4
Do you know he promised me marriage?,4
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?,4
as I said; but more than that he loved her: for,4
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I,4
knew of their going to bed and of other motions,4
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not,4
Thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say,4
evidence; therefore stand aside.,4
Ay my good lord.,4
It was not given me nor I did not buy it.,4
It was not lent me neither.,4
I found it not.,4
How could you give it him?,4
This woman's an easy glove my lord; she goes off,4
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.,4
Take her away; I do not like her now;,4
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,4
I'll never tell you.,4
I'll put in bail my liege.,4
By Jove if ever I knew man 'twas you.,4
Because he's guilty and he is not guilty:,4
I'll swear I am a maid and he knows not.,4
I am either maid or else this old man's wife.,4
Good mother fetch my bail. Stay royal sir:,4
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,4
Who hath abused me as he knows himself,4
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;,4
Dead though she be she feels her young one kick:,4
And now behold the meaning.,4
Is there no exorcist,4
Is't real that I see?,4
Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,4
Both both. O pardon!,4
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;,4
When from my finger you can get this ring,4
Will you be mine now you are doubly won?,4
I'll love her dearly ever ever dearly.,4
Deadly divorce step between me and you!,4
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:,4
Good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher: so,4
Let thy courtesies alone they are scurvy ones.,4
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.,4
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,4
For I can guess that by thy honest aid,4
Of that and all the progress more or less,4
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,4
Flourish,4
The king's a beggar now the play is done:,4
That you express content; which we will pay,4
Ours be your patience then and yours our parts;,4
Exeunt,4
SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.,5
As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion,5
and as thou sayest charged my brother on his,5
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school and,5
he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more,5
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that,5
are bred better; for besides that they are fair,5
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I his,5
which his animals on his dunghills are as much,5
plentifully gives me the something that nature gave,5
me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a,5
gentility with my education. This is it Adam that,5
think is within me begins to mutiny against this,5
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.,5
Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will,5
Enter OLIVER,5
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.,5
Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God,5
Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile.,5
What prodigal portion have I spent that I should,5
Know you where your are sir?,5
Know you before whom sir?,5

courtesy of nations allows you my better in that,5
takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers,5

What boy!,5
Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?,5
Rowland de Boys; he was my father and he is thrice,5
Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand,5
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.,5
remembrance be at accord.,5
I will not till I please: you shall hear me. My,5
education: you have trained me like a peasant,5
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in,5
me such exercises as may become a gentleman or,5
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.,5
Well sir get you in: I will not long be troubled,5
pray you leave me.,5
Get you with him you old dog.,5
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!,5
Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM,5
physic your rankness and yet give no thousand,5
Enter DENNIS,5
Was not Charles the duke's wrestler here to speak with me?,5
access to you.,5
Exit DENNIS,5
Enter CHARLES,5
Good Monsieur Charles what's the new news at the,5
There's no news at the court sir but the old news:,5
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords,5
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;,5
Can you tell if Rosalind the duke's daughter be,5
O no; for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves,5
that she would have followed her exile or have died,5
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and,5
Where will the old duke live?,5
a many merry men with him; and there they live like,5
gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time,5
What you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?,5
matter. I am given sir secretly to understand,5
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.,5
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him,5
for your love I would be loath to foil him as I,5
out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you,5
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall,5
and altogether against my will.,5
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had,5
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from,5
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full,5
good parts a secret and villanous contriver against,5
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck,5
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not,5
against thee by poison entrap thee by some,5
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;,5
it there is not one so young and so villanous this,5
should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must,5
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come,5
alone again I'll never wrestle for prize more: and,5
Farewell good Charles.,5
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see,5
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle never,5
all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much,5
people who best know him that I am altogether,5
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that,5
Exit,5
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND,5
Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of;,5
teach me to forget a banished father you must not,5
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight,5
had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou,5
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,5
tempered as mine is to thee.,5
rejoice in yours.,5
like to have: and truly when he dies thou shalt,5
father perforce I will render thee again in,5
that oath let me turn monster: therefore my,5
From henceforth I will coz and devise sports. Let,5
Marry I prithee do to make sport withal: but,5
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst,5
What shall be our sport then?,5
her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.,5
mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman,5
Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce,5
makes very ill-favouredly.,5
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,5
Enter TOUCHSTONE,5
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature,5
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?,5
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of,5
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither but,5
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this,5
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,5
Mistress you must come away to your father.,5
No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you.,5
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they,5
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it the,5
yet was not the knight forsworn.,5
knowledge?,5
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and,5
By our beards if we had them thou art.,5
swear by that that is not you are not forsworn: no,5
never had any; or if he had he had sworn it away,5
Prithee who is't that thou meanest?,5
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!,5
one of these days.,5
wise men do foolishly.,5
wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery,5
Monsieur Le Beau.,5
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.,5
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.,5
Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?,5
Sport! of what colour?,5
As wit and fortune will.,5
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.,5
Thou losest thy old smell.,5
wrestling which you have lost the sight of.,5
I will tell you the beginning; and if it please,5
yet to do; and here where you are they are coming,5
Well the beginning that is dead and buried.,5
I could match this beginning with an old tale.,5
With bills on their necks 'Be it known unto all men,5
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the,5
and broke three of his ribs that there is little,5
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,5
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.,5
But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies,5
Why this that I speak of.,5
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport,5
Or I I promise thee.,5
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon,5
You must if you stay here; for here is the place,5
perform it.,5
Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords ORLANDO CHARLES and Attendants,5
own peril on his forwardness.,5
Even he madam.,5
How now daughter and cousin! are you crept hither,5
Ay my liege so please you give us leave.,5
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the,5
will not be entreated. Speak to him ladies; see if,5
Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau.,5
Monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you.,5
Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler?,5
come but in as others do to try with him the,5
Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your,5
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or,5
adventure would counsel you to a more equal,5
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.,5
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke,5
I beseech you punish me not with your hard,5
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let,5
trial: wherein if I be foiled there is but one,5
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my,5
world no injury for in it I have nothing; only in,5
supplied when I have made it empty.,5
And mine to eke out hers.,5
Your heart's desires be with you!,5
desirous to lie with his mother earth?,5
You shall try but one fall.,5
to a second that have so mightily persuaded him,5
An you mean to mock me after you should not have,5
Now Hercules be thy speed young man!,5
fellow by the leg.,5
O excellent young man!,5
should down.,5
No more no more.,5
How dost thou Charles?,5
Bear him away. What is thy name young man?,5
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:,5
But I did find him still mine enemy:,5
Hadst thou descended from another house.,5
I would thou hadst told me of another father.,5
Were I my father coz would I do this?,5
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,5
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,5
Had I before known this young man his son,5
Ere he should thus have ventured.,5
Let us go thank him and encourage him:,5
Sticks me at heart. Sir you have well deserved:,5
But justly as you have exceeded all promise,5
Gentleman,5
Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune,5
Shall we go coz?,5
Can I not say I thank you? My better parts,5
Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block.,5
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call sir?,5
More than your enemies.,5
Have with you. Fare you well.,5
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?,5
O poor Orlando thou art overthrown!,5
Re-enter LE BEAU,5
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved,5
Yet such is now the duke's condition,5
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,5
I thank you sir: and pray you tell me this:,5
That here was at the wrestling?,5
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter,5
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,5
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.,5
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,5
But that the people praise her for her virtues,5
And on my life his malice 'gainst the lady,5
Hereafter in a better world than this,5
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.,5
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;,5
But heavenly Rosalind!,5
SCENE III. A room in the palace.,5
Why cousin! why Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?,5
No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon,5
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one,5
without any.,5
No some of it is for my child's father. O how,5
They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in,5
paths our very petticoats will catch them.,5
Hem them away.,5
Come come wrestle with thy affections.,5
O a good wish upon you! you will try in time in,5
service let us talk in good earnest: is it,5
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?,5
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son,5
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate,5
No faith hate him not for my sake.,5
Let me love him for that and do you love him,5
With his eyes full of anger.,5
Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste,5
Me uncle?,5
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found,5
Thou diest for it.,5
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:,5
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,5
As I do trust I am not--then dear uncle,5
Did I offend your highness.,5
If their purgation did consist in words,5
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.,5
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.,5
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;,5
Treason is not inherited my lord;,5
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:,5
To think my poverty is treacherous.,5
Ay Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,5
I did not then entreat to have her stay;,5
I was too young that time to value her;,5
Why so am I; we still have slept together,5
And wheresoever we went like Juno's swans,5
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,5
Speak to the people and they pity her.,5
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous,5
Firm and irrevocable is my doom,5
Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege:,5
You are a fool. You niece provide yourself:,5
And in the greatness of my word you die.,5
O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go?,5
I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am.,5
Thou hast not cousin;,5
Hath banish'd me his daughter?,5
No hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love,5
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part sweet girl?,5
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,5
And do not seek to take your change upon you,5
For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale,5
Why whither shall we go?,5
Alas what danger will it be to us,5
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.,5
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;,5
And never stir assailants.,5
Because that I am more than common tall,5
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,5
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--,5
As many other mannish cowards have,5
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?,5
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.,5
Something that hath a reference to my state,5
But cousin what if we assay'd to steal,5
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?,5
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,5
Devise the fittest time and safest way,5
After my flight. Now go we in content,5
Exeunt,5
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.,5
Now my co-mates and brothers in exile,5
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods,5
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,5
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,5
Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say,5
That feelingly persuade me what I am.',5
Which like the toad ugly and venomous,5
And this our life exempt from public haunt,5
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.,5
Happy is your grace,5
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.,5
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,5
Should in their own confines with forked heads,5
Indeed my lord,5
And in that kind swears you do more usurp,5
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself,5
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out,5
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,5
Did come to languish and indeed my lord,5
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat,5
Coursed one another down his innocent nose,5
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,5
Augmenting it with tears.,5
Did he not moralize this spectacle?,5
First for his weeping into the needless stream;,5
As worldlings do giving thy sum of more,5
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,5
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,5
And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,5
Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look,5
Thus most invectively he pierceth through,5
Yea and of this our life swearing that we,5
To fright the animals and to kill them up,5
And did you leave him in this contemplation?,5
Upon the sobbing deer.,5
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,5
I'll bring you to him straight.,5
SCENE II. A room in the palace.,5
Can it be possible that no man saw them?,5
Are of consent and sufferance in this.,5
The ladies her attendants of her chamber,5
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.,5
Your grace was wont to laugh is also missing.,5
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard,5
The parts and graces of the wrestler,5
And she believes wherever they are gone,5
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;,5
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,5
To bring again these foolish runaways.,5
SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.,5
Who's there?,5
O my sweet master! O you memory,5
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?,5
Why would you be so fond to overcome,5
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.,5
Their graces serve them but as enemies?,5
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.,5
Envenoms him that bears it!,5
O unhappy youth!,5
The enemy of all your graces lives:,5
Yet not the son I will not call him son,5
Hath heard your praises and this night he means,5
And you within it: if he fail of that,5
I overheard him and his practises.,5
Abhor it fear it do not enter it.,5
No matter whither so you come not here.,5
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce,5
This I must do or know not what to do:,5
I rather will subject me to the malice,5
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,5
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,5
And unregarded age in corners thrown:,5
Yea providently caters for the sparrow,5
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:,5
For in my youth I never did apply,5
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo,5
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,5
I'll do the service of a younger man,5
O good old man how well in thee appears,5
When service sweat for duty not for meed!,5
Where none will sweat but for promotion,5
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.,5
That cannot so much as a blossom yield,5
But come thy ways; well go along together,5
We'll light upon some settled low content.,5
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.,5
Here lived I but now live here no more.,5
But at fourscore it is too late a week:,5
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.,5
SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.,5
O Jupiter how weary are my spirits!,5
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's,5
the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show,5
good Aliena!,5
For my part I had rather bear with you than bear,5
for I think you have no money in your purse.,5
Ay now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was,5
must be content.,5
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS,5
solemn talk.,5
O Corin that thou knew'st how I do love her!,5
No Corin being old thou canst not guess,5
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:,5
As sure I think did never man love so--,5
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?,5
O thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!,5
That ever love did make thee run into,5
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,5
Thou hast not loved:,5
Abruptly as my passion now makes me,5
O Phebe Phebe Phebe!,5
Alas poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,5
And I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke,5
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the,5
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the,5
two cods and giving her them again said with,5
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is,5
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.,5
break my shins against it.,5
Is much upon my fashion.,5
I pray you one of you question yond man,5
I faint almost to death.,5
Peace fool: he's not thy kinsman.,5
Your betters sir.,5
Peace I say. Good even to you friend.,5
I prithee shepherd if that love or gold,5
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:,5
And faints for succor.,5
And wish for her sake more than for mine own,5
But I am shepherd to another man,5
My master is of churlish disposition,5
By doing deeds of hospitality:,5
Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now,5
That you will feed on; but what is come see.,5
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?,5
That little cares for buying any thing.,5
Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock,5
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.,5
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:,5
The soil the profit and this kind of life,5
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.,5

Who loves to lie with me,5
Unto the sweet bird's throat,5
Here shall he see No enemy,5
More more I prithee more.,5
I thank it. More I prithee more. I can suck,5
More I prithee more.,5
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to,5
What you will Monsieur Jaques.,5
nothing. Will you sing?,5
Well then if ever I thank any man I'll thank you;,5
of two dog-apes and when a man thanks me heartily,5
the beggarly thanks. Come sing; and you that will,5
Well I'll end the song. Sirs cover the while; the,5
this day to look you.,5
too disputable for my company: I think of as many,5
boast of them. Come warble come.,5
Who doth ambition shun,5
And loves to live i' the sun,5
And pleased with what he gets,5
Here shall he see No enemy,5
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made,5
And I'll sing it.,5
If it do come to pass,5
Leaving his wealth and ease,5
Ducdame ducdame ducdame:,5
Gross fools as he,5
What's that 'ducdame'?,5
circle. I'll go sleep if I can; if I cannot I'll,5
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.,5
SCENE VI. The forest.,5
Dear master I can go no further. O I die for food!,5
kind master.,5
a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.,5
will either be food for it or bring it for food to,5
For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at,5
and if I bring thee not something to eat I will,5
come thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!,5
Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come I will bear,5
lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this,5
Exeunt,5
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and Lords like outlaws,5
For I can no where find him like a man.,5
Here was he merry hearing of a song.,5
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.,5
Enter JAQUES,5
Why how now monsieur! what a life is this,5
What you look merrily!,5
A motley fool; a miserable world!,5
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,5
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.,5
Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:',5
And looking on it with lack-lustre eye,5
Thus we may see' quoth he 'how the world wags:,5
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;,5
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot;,5
The motley fool thus moral on the time,5
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,5
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!,5
What fool is this?,5
And says if ladies be but young and fair,5
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit,5
With observation the which he vents,5
I am ambitious for a motley coat.,5
It is my only suit;,5
Of all opinion that grows rank in them,5
Withal as large a charter as the wind,5
And they that are most galled with my folly,5
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:,5
Doth very foolishly although he smart,5
The wise man's folly is anatomized,5
Invest me in my motley; give me leave,5
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,5
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.,5
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin:,5
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;,5
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,5
Why who cries out on pride,5
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,5
What woman in the city do I name,5
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?,5
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?,5
That says his bravery is not of my cost,5
His folly to the mettle of my speech?,5
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,5
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,5
Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn,5
Why I have eat none yet.,5
Of what kind should this cock come of?,5
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,5
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point,5
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred,5
He dies that touches any of this fruit,5
An you will not be answered with reason I must die.,5
More than your force move us to gentleness.,5
Sit down and feed and welcome to our table.,5
I thought that all things had been savage here;,5
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are,5
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,5
If ever you have look'd on better days,5
If ever sat at any good man's feast,5
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,5
In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.,5
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,5
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:,5
And take upon command what help we have,5
Then but forbear your food a little while,5
And give it food. There is an old poor man,5
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,5
I will not touch a bit.,5
And we will nothing waste till you return.,5
Exit,5
This wide and universal theatre,5
Wherein we play in.,5
And all the men and women merely players:,5
And one man in his time plays many parts,5
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.,5
And shining morning face creeping like snail,5
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad,5
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,5
Seeking the bubble reputation,5
In fair round belly with good capon lined,5
Full of wise saws and modern instances;,5
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,5
His youthful hose well saved a world too wide,5
Turning again toward childish treble pipes,5
That ends this strange eventful history,5
Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything.,5
Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,5
I thank you most for him.,5
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.,5
As yet to question you about your fortunes.,5
SONG.,5
Thou art not so unkind,5
Thy tooth is not so keen,5
Although thy breath be rude.,5
Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly:,5
This life is most jolly.,5
That dost not bite so nigh,5
Though thou the waters warp,5
As friend remember'd not.,5
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,5
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness,5
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke,5
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,5
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,5
Exeunt,5
SCENE I. A room in the palace.,5
Not see him since? Sir sir that cannot be:,5
I should not seek an absent argument,5
Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;,5
Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more,5
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine,5
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth,5
O that your highness knew my heart in this!,5
More villain thou. Well push him out of doors;,5
Make an extent upon his house and lands:,5
Exeunt,5
Enter ORLANDO with a paper,5
And thou thrice-crowned queen of night survey,5
Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.,5
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;,5
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.,5
The fair the chaste and unexpressive she.,5
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE,5
Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good,5
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary I,5
private it is a very vile life. Now in respect it,5
respect it is not in the court it is tedious. As,5
but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much,5
No more but that I know the more one sickens the,5
means and content is without three good friends;,5
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a,5
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may,5
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in,5
No truly.,5
Nay I hope.,5
on one side.,5
Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest,5
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is,5
state shepherd.,5
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the,5
court. You told me you salute not at the court but,5
uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.,5
Why we are still handling our ewes and their,5
Why do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not,5
a man? Shallow shallow. A better instance I say; come.,5
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.,5
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of,5
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.,5
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise and,5
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance shepherd.,5
Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee shallow man!,5
Sir I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat get,5
happiness glad of other men's good content with my,5
graze and my lambs suck.,5
and the rams together and to offer to get your,5
bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a,5
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not,5
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst,5
Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistress's brother.,5
From the east to western Ind,5
Her worth being mounted on the wind,5
All the pictures fairest lined,5
Let no fair be kept in mind,5
I'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and,5
right butter-women's rank to market.,5
For a taste:,5
Let him seek out Rosalind.,5
So be sure will Rosalind.,5
So must slender Rosalind.,5
Then to cart with Rosalind.,5
Such a nut is Rosalind.,5
Must find love's prick and Rosalind.,5
infect yourself with them?,5
Truly the tree yields bad fruit.,5
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit,5
ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar.,5
forest judge.,5
Peace! Here comes my sister reading: stand aside.,5
Why should this a desert be?,5
Tongues I'll hang on every tree,5
Some how brief the life of man,5
That the stretching of a span,5
Some of violated vows,5
But upon the fairest boughs,5
Will I Rosalinda write,5
The quintessence of every sprite,5
Therefore Heaven Nature charged,5
With all graces wide-enlarged:,5
Helen's cheek but not her heart,5
Atalanta's better part,5
Thus Rosalind of many parts,5
Of many faces eyes and hearts,5
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,5
O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love,5
cried 'Have patience good people!',5
Go with him sirrah.,5
though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage.,5
Didst thou hear these verses?,5
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.,5
Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear,5
lamely in the verse.,5
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?,5
before you came; for look here what I found on a,5
Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat which I,5
Trow you who hath done this?,5
And a chain that you once wore about his neck.,5
I prithee who?,5
meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes,5
Nay but who is it?,5
Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,5
O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful,5
out of all hooping!,5
caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in,5
South-sea of discovery; I prithee tell me who is it,5
stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man,5
mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at,5
may drink thy tidings.,5
Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his,5
Nay he hath but a little beard.,5
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard if,5
It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestler's,5
Nay but the devil take mocking: speak sad brow and,5
I' faith coz 'tis he.,5
Orlando.,5
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said,5
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?,5
him again? Answer me in one word.,5
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To,5
answer in a catechism.,5
man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the,5
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the,5
finding him and relish it with good observance.,5
It may well be called Jove's tree when it drops,5
Give me audience good madam.,5
There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight.,5
becomes the ground.,5
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.,5
I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest,5
Do you not know I am a woman? when I think I must,5
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?,5
Tis he: slink by and note him.,5
as lief have been myself alone.,5
too for your society.,5
I do desire we may be better strangers.,5
love-songs in their barks.,5
them ill-favouredly.,5
Yes just.,5
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was,5
What stature is she of?,5
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been,5
out of rings?,5
whence you have studied your questions.,5
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and,5
all our misery.,5
against whom I know most faults.,5
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.,5
By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found,5
He is drowned in the brook: look but in and you,5
There I shall see mine own figure.,5
I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell good,5
I am glad of your departure: adieu good Monsieur,5
Exit JAQUES,5
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.,5
Very well: what would you?,5
You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock,5
Then there is no true lover in the forest; else,5
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.,5
been as proper?,5
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles,5
withal and who he stands still withal.,5
Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the,5
solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,5
seven year.,5
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that,5
he cannot study and the other lives merrily because,5
and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden,5
Who doth he gallop withal?,5
softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there.,5
With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between,5
Where dwell you pretty youth?,5
skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat.,5
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.,5
purchase in so removed a dwelling.,5
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was,5
too well for there he fell in love. I have heard,5
I am not a woman to be touched with so many,5
whole sex withal.,5
laid to the charge of women?,5
another as half-pence are every one fault seeming,5
I prithee recount some of them.,5
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that,5
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies,5
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would,5
quotidian of love upon him.,5
your remedy.,5
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage,5
What were his marks?,5
sunken which you have not an unquestionable,5
which you have not; but I pardon you for that for,5
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered your,5
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a,5
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as,5
Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love.,5
love believe it; which I warrant she is apter to,5
points in the which women still give the lie to,5
that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind,5
I swear to thee youth by the white hand of,5
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?,5
Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves,5
the reason why they are not so punished and cured,5
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.,5
Yes one and in this manner. He was to imagine me,5
woo me: at which time would I being but a moonish,5
and liking proud fantastical apish shallow,5
passion something and for no passion truly any,5
cattle of this colour; would now like him now loathe,5
for him then spit at him; that I drave my suitor,5
madness; which was to forswear the full stream of,5
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon,5
heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't.,5
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind,5
Now by the faith of my love I will: tell me,5
Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way,5
Will you go?,5
Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come sister will you go?,5
SCENE III. The forest.,5
Come apace good Audrey: I will fetch up your,5
doth my simple feature content you?,5
I am here with thee and thy goats as the most,5
[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited worse than Jove,5
When a man's verses cannot be understood nor a,5
Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a,5
the gods had made thee poetical.,5
deed and word? is it a true thing?,5
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry and what,5
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?,5
honest: now if thou wert a poet I might have some,5
Would you not have me honest?,5
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.,5
Well I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods,5
Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut,5
I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul.,5
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may,5
with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next,5
of the forest and to couple us.,5
Well the gods give us joy!,5
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple,5
though? C ourage! As horns are odious they are,5
his goods:' right; many a man has good horns and,5
his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?,5
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man,5
worthier than a village so is the forehead of a,5
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no,5
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.,5
Sir Oliver Martext you are well met: will you,5
with you to your chapel?,5
I will not take her on gift of any man.,5
[Advancing],5
Good even good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,5
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a,5
Will you be married motley?,5
the falcon her bells so man hath his desires; and,5
And will you being a man of your breeding be,5
church and have a good priest that can tell you,5
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will,5
[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be,5
to marry me well; and not being well married it,5
Go thou with me and let me counsel thee.,5
We must be married or we must live in bawdry.,5
O sweet Oliver,5
Leave me not behind thee: but--,5
Begone I say,5
Exeunt JAQUES TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY,5
all shall flout me out of my calling.,5
SCENE IV. The forest.,5
Never talk to me; I will weep.,5
that tears do not become a man.,5
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.,5
Something browner than Judas's marry his kisses are,5
I' faith his hair is of a good colour.,5
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch,5
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun,5
the very ice of chastity is in them.,5
comes not?,5
Do you think so?,5
horse-stealer but for his verity in love I do,5
worm-eaten nut.,5
Yes when he is in; but I think he is not in.,5
Was' is not 'is:' besides the oath of a lover is,5
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends,5
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with,5
him of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.,5
man as Orlando?,5
speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks,5
his lover; as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse,5
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly,5
Enter CORIN,5
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,5
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess,5
Well and what of him?,5
Between the pale complexion of true love,5
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,5
O come let us remove:,5
Bring us to this sight and you shall say,5
Exeunt,5
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE,5
Say that you love me not but say not so,5
Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,5
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be,5
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN behind,5
I fly thee for I would not injure thee.,5
Tis pretty sure and very probable,5
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,5
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;,5
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;,5
Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers!,5
Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains,5
The cicatrice and capable impressure,5
Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not,5
That can do hurt.,5
If ever--as that ever may be near--,5
Then shall you know the wounds invisible,5
But till that time,5
Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not;,5
And why I pray you? Who might be your mother,5
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty--,5
Than without candle may go dark to bed--,5
Why what means this? Why do you look on me?,5
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,5
No faith proud mistress hope not after it:,5
Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream,5
You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her,5
You are a thousand times a properer man,5
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:,5
And out of you she sees herself more proper,5
But mistress know yourself: down on your knees,5
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,5
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:,5
So take her to thee shepherd: fare you well.,5
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.,5
fall in love with my anger. If it be so as fast as,5
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?,5
I pray you do not fall in love with me,5
Besides I like you not. If you will know my house,5
Will you go sister? Shepherd ply her hard.,5
And be not proud: though all the world could see,5
Come to our flock.,5
Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might,5
Sweet Phebe--,5
Sweet Phebe pity me.,5
Wherever sorrow is relief would be:,5
By giving love your sorrow and my grief,5
Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?,5
Why that were covetousness.,5
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;,5
Thy company which erst was irksome to me,5
But do not look for further recompense,5
So holy and so perfect is my love,5
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop,5
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then,5
Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?,5
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds,5
Think not I love him though I ask for him:,5
But what care I for words? yet words do well,5
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:,5
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him,5
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.,5
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:,5
A little riper and more lusty red,5
Between the constant red and mingled damask.,5
In parcels as I did would have gone near,5
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet,5
For what had he to do to chide at me?,5
And now I am remember'd scorn'd at me:,5
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.,5
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou Silvius?,5
I'll write it straight;,5
I will be bitter with him and passing short.,5
Exeunt,5
SCENE I. The forest.,5
I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted,5
They say you are a melancholy fellow.,5
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable,5
censure worse than drunkards.,5
Why then 'tis good to be a post.,5
emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical,5
soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's,5
the lover's which is all these: but it is a,5
extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry's,5
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.,5
be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see,5
nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.,5
And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have,5
sad; and to travel for it too!,5
Good day and happiness dear Rosalind!,5
Exit,5
wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your,5
almost chide God for making you that countenance you,5
gondola. Why how now Orlando! where have you been,5
another trick never come in my sight more.,5
Break an hour's promise in love! He that will,5
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the,5
hath clapped him o' the shoulder but I'll warrant,5
Pardon me dear Rosalind.,5
had as lief be wooed of a snail.,5
Ay of a snail; for though he comes slowly he,5
I think than you make a woman: besides he brings,5
What's that?,5
beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in,5
Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.,5
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a,5
Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday,5
say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind?,5
Nay you were better speak first and when you were,5
occasion to kiss. Very good orators when they are,5
warn us!--matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss.,5
Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter.,5
Marry that should you if I were your mistress or,5
What of my suit?,5
Am not I your Rosalind?,5
talking of her.,5
Then in mine own person I die.,5
almost six thousand years old and in all this time,5
videlicit in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains,5
could to die before and he is one of the patterns,5
year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been,5
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being,5
coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.',5
time and worms have eaten them but not for love.,5
for I protest her frown might kill me.,5
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on,5
it.,5
Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all.,5
Ay and twenty such.,5
Are you not good?,5
Why then can one desire too much of a good thing?,5
Give me your hand Orlando. What do you say sister?,5
I cannot say the words.,5
Go to. Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind?,5
Ay but when?,5
Then you must say 'I take thee Rosalind for wife.',5
I might ask you for your commission; but I do take,5
before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought,5
So do all thoughts; they are winged.,5
have possessed her.,5
Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No no Orlando;,5
maids are May when they are maids but the sky,5
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,5
new-fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires,5
in the fountain and I will do that when you are,5
that when thou art inclined to sleep.,5
By my life she will do as I do.,5
Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the,5
wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and,5
with the smoke out at the chimney.,5
Wit whither wilt?',5
your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.,5
Marry to say she came to seek you there. You shall,5
her without her tongue. O that woman that cannot,5
never nurse her child herself for she will breed,5
For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee.,5
I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I,5
Ay go your ways go your ways; I knew what you,5
thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours,5
death! Two o'clock is your hour?,5
By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend,5
if you break one jot of your promise or come one,5
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover,5
may be chosen out of the gross band of the,5
your promise.,5
Rosalind: so adieu.,5
offenders and let Time try: adieu.,5
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:,5
head and show the world what the bird hath done to,5
O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou,5
it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown,5
Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour,5
No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot,5
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes,5
am in love. I'll tell thee Aliena I cannot be out,5
sigh till he come.,5
Exeunt,5
Enter JAQUES Lords and Foresters,5
Sir it was I.,5
conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's,5
you no song forester for this purpose?,5
Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune so it,5
SONG.,5
His leather skin and horns to wear.,5
The rest shall bear this burden,5
It was a crest ere thou wast born:,5
And thy father bore it:,5
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.,5
SCENE III. The forest.,5
How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and,5
I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he,5
sleep. Look who comes here.,5
My errand is to you fair youth;,5
I know not the contents; but as I guess,5
Which she did use as she was writing of it,5
I am but as a guiltless messenger.,5
And play the swaggerer; bear this bear all:,5
She calls me proud and that she could not love me,5
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:,5
This is a letter of your own device.,5
Phebe did write it.,5
And turn'd into the extremity of love.,5
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think,5
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:,5
This is a man's invention and his hand.,5
Why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.,5
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain,5
Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect,5
So please you for I never heard it yet;,5
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.,5
Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,5
Can a woman rail thus?,5
[Reads],5
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?,5
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,5
Meaning me a beast.,5
Have power to raise such love in mine,5
Would they work in mild aspect!,5
How then might your prayers move!,5
Little knows this love in me:,5
Whether that thy youth and kind,5
Of me and all that I can make;,5
And then I'll study how to die.,5
Alas poor shepherd!,5
thou love such a woman? What to make thee an,5
be endured! Well go your way to her for I see,5
her: that if she love me I charge her to love,5
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,5
Exit SILVIUS,5
Good morrow fair ones: pray you if you know,5
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?,5
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream,5
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;,5
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,5
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,5
Like a ripe sister: the woman low,5
The owner of the house I did inquire for?,5
Orlando doth commend him to you both,5
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?,5
Some of my shame; if you will know of me,5
This handkercher was stain'd.,5
When last the young Orlando parted from you,5
Within an hour and pacing through the forest,5
Lo what befell! he threw his eye aside,5
Under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age,5
A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair,5
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,5
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,5
And with indented glides did slip away,5
A lioness with udders all drawn dry,5
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis,5
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:,5
And found it was his brother his elder brother.,5
And he did render him the most unnatural,5
And well he might so do,5
But to Orlando: did he leave him there,5
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;,5
And nature stronger than his just occasion,5
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling,5
Are you his brother?,5
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?,5
To tell you what I was since my conversion,5
But for the bloody napkin?,5
When from the first to last betwixt us two,5
As how I came into that desert place:--,5
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,5
Who led me instantly unto his cave,5
The lioness had torn some flesh away,5
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.,5
And after some small space being strong at heart,5
To tell this story that you might excuse,5
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth,5
ROSALIND swoons,5
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.,5
Look he recovers.,5
We'll lead you thither.,5
Be of good cheer youth: you a man! you lack a,5
I do so I confess it. Ah sirrah a body would,5
your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!,5
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion,5
Counterfeit I assure you.,5
So I do: but i' faith I should have been a woman by right.,5
homewards. Good sir go with us.,5
How you excuse my brother Rosalind.,5
my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?,5
ACT V,5
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY,5

Enter WILLIAM,5

Good even gentle friend. Cover thy head cover thy,5
Five and twenty sir.,5
William sir.,5
Ay sir I thank God.,5
Faith sir so so.,5
yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?,5
Why thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,5
knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen,5
would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;,5
lips to open. You do love this maid?,5
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?,5
Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it,5
of a cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty,5
is he: now you are not ipse for I am he.,5
He sir that must marry this woman. Therefore you,5
society--which in the boorish is company--of this,5
together is abandon the society of this female or,5
understanding diest; or to wit I kill thee make,5
liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with,5
with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with,5
therefore tremble and depart.,5
God rest you merry sir.,5
Enter CORIN,5
Trip Audrey! trip Audrey! I attend I attend.,5
SCENE II. The forest.,5
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you,5
her? and loving woo? and wooing she should,5
Neither call the giddiness of it in question the,5
wooing nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,5
consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it,5
the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I,5
You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:,5
followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look,5
Enter ROSALIND,5
And you fair sister.,5
O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee,5
It is my arm.,5
of a lion.,5
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to,5
Ay and greater wonders than that.,5
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams,5
overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner,5
loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner,5
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;,5
to marriage which they will climb incontinent or,5
the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs,5
They shall be married to-morrow and I will bid the,5
is to look into happiness through another man's,5
the height of heart-heaviness by how much I shall,5
Why then to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?,5
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.,5
that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I,5
of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are;,5
some little measure draw a belief from you to do,5
you please that I can do strange things: I have,5
magician most profound in his art and yet not,5
as your gesture cries it out when your brother,5
what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is,5
to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human,5
Speakest thou in sober meanings?,5
say I am a magician. Therefore put you in your,5
married to-morrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will.,5
Look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.,5
To show the letter that I writ to you.,5
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:,5
Look upon him love him; he worships you.,5
It is to be all made of sighs and tears;,5
And I for Ganymede.,5
And I for no woman.,5
And so am I for Phebe.,5
And I for Rosalind.,5
It is to be all made of fantasy,5
All adoration duty and observance,5
All purity all trial all observance;,5
And so am I for Ganymede.,5
And so am I for no woman.,5
If this be so why blame you me to love you?,5
Who do you speak to 'Why blame you me to love you?',5
Pray you no more of this; 'tis like the howling,5
To SILVIUS,5
To PHEBE,5
To PHEBE,5
married to-morrow:,5
I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man and you,5
To SILVIUS,5
you and you shall be married to-morrow.,5
As you love Rosalind meet:,5
as you love Phebe meet: and as I love no woman,5
I'll not fail if I live.,5
Nor I.,5
SCENE III. The forest.,5
To-morrow is the joyful day Audrey; to-morrow will,5
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is,5
world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.,5
Well met honest gentleman.,5
We are for you: sit i' the middle.,5
spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only,5
I'faith i'faith; and both in a tune like two,5

In the spring time the only pretty ring time,5
Sweet lovers love the spring.,5

In spring time  and c.,5
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino;,5

You are deceived sir: we kept time we lost not our time.,5
such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend,5
Exeunt,5
Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS JAQUES ORLANDO OLIVER and CELIA,5
Can do all this that he hath promised?,5
As those that fear they hope and know they fear.,5
Patience once more whiles our compact is urged:,5
You will bestow her on Orlando here?,5
And you say you will have her when I bring her?,5
You say you'll marry me if I be willing?,5
But if you do refuse to marry me,5
So is the bargain.,5
Though to have her and death were both one thing.,5
Keep you your word O duke to give your daughter;,5
Keep your word Phebe that you'll marry me,5
Keep your word Silvius that you'll marry her.,5
To make these doubts all even.,5
I do remember in this shepherd boy,5
My lord the first time that I ever saw him,5
But my good lord this boy is forest-born,5
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,5
Obscured in the circle of this forest.,5
There is sure another flood toward and these,5
very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools.,5
Good my lord bid him welcome: this is the,5

with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have,5
And how was that ta'en up?,5

I like him very well.,5
press in here sir amongst the rest of the country,5
marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,5
humour of mine sir to take that that no man else,5
poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.,5
According to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases.,5
quarrel on the seventh cause?,5
seeming Audrey:--as thus sir. I did dislike the,5

If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut' he,5
this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was,5
called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not,5
is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not,5
Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie,5
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?,5
nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we,5
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?,5
books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.,5
Quip Modest; the third the Reply Churlish; the,5
Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth the Lie with,5
these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may,5
justices could not take up a quarrel but when the,5
of an If as 'If you said so then I said so;' and,5
only peacemaker; much virtue in If.,5
any thing and yet a fool.,5
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.,5
Still Music,5
When earthly things made even,5
Good duke receive thy daughter,5
Yea brought her hither,5
Whose heart within his bosom is.,5
To ORLANDO,5
If there be truth in sight you are my daughter.,5
If sight and shape be true,5
I'll have no father if you be not he:,5
Nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she.,5
Tis I must make conclusion,5
Here's eight that must take hands,5
If truth holds true contents.,5
You and you are heart in heart,5
Or have a woman to your lord:,5
As the winter to foul weather.,5
Feed yourselves with questioning;,5
How thus we met and these things finish.,5
Wedding is great Juno's crown:,5
Tis Hymen peoples every town;,5
Honour high honour and renown,5
O my dear niece welcome thou art to me!,5
I will not eat my word now thou art mine;,5
Enter JAQUES DE BOYS,5
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,5
Duke Frederick hearing how that every day,5
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,5
His brother here and put him to the sword:,5
Where meeting with an old religious man,5
Both from his enterprise and from the world,5
And all their lands restored to them again,5
I do engage my life.,5
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:,5
A land itself at large a potent dukedom.,5
That here were well begun and well begot:,5
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us,5
According to the measure of their states.,5
And fall into our rustic revelry.,5
With measure heap'd in joy to the measures fall.,5
The duke hath put on a religious life,5
He hath.,5
There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.,5
You to your former honour I bequeath;,5
To ORLANDO,5
To OLIVER,5
To SILVIUS,5
To TOUCHSTONE,5
Is but for two months victuall'd. So to your pleasures:,5
Stay Jaques stay.,5
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.,5
Proceed proceed: we will begin these rites,5
A dance,5
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;,5
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs,5
epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,5
epilogues. What a case am I in then that am,5
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not,5
become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin,5
you bear to men to like as much of this play as,5
you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,5
women the play may please. If I were a woman I,5
me complexions that liked me and breaths that I,5
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my,5
Exeunt,5
SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
Nay but this dotage of our general's,6
That o'er the files and musters of the war,6
The office and devotion of their view,6
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst,6
And is become the bellows and the fan,6
Flourish. Enter ANTONY CLEOPATRA her Ladies the Train with Eunuchs fanning her,6
Take but good note and you shall see in him.,6
Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.,6
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.,6
Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth.,6
News my good lord from Rome.,6
Nay hear them Antony:,6
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent,6
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;,6
How my love!,6
You must not stay here longer your dismission,6
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?,6
Thou blushest Antony; and that blood of thine,6
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!,6
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.,6
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life,6
Embracing,6
On pain of punishment the world to weet,6
Excellent falsehood!,6
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony,6
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.,6
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:,6
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?,6
Fie wrangling queen!,6
To weep; whose every passion fully strives,6
No messenger but thine; and all alone,6
The qualities of people. Come my queen;,6
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train,6
Sir sometimes when he is not Antony,6
Which still should go with Antony.,6
That he approves the common liar who,6
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!,6
SCENE II. The same. Another room.,6
Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most any thing Alexas,6
that you praised so to the queen? O that I knew,6
with garlands!,6
Your will?,6
In nature's infinite book of secrecy,6
Show him your hand.,6
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough,6
Good sir give me good fortune.,6
Pray then foresee me one.,6
He means in flesh.,6
Wrinkles forbid!,6
Hush!,6
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.,6
Good now some excellent fortune! Let me be married,6
let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod of Jewry,6
Caesar and companion me with my mistress.,6
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.,6
Than that which is to approach.,6
prithee how many boys and wenches must I have?,6
And fertile every wish a million.,6
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.,6
We'll know all our fortunes.,6
be--drunk to bed.,6
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.,6
Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful,6
tell her but a worky-day fortune.,6
But how but how? give me particulars.,6
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?,6
I where would you choose it?,6
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas--come,6
that cannot go sweet Isis I beseech thee! and let,6
follow worse till the worst of all follow him,6
Isis hear me this prayer though thou deny me a,6
Amen. Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people!,6
loose-wived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a,6
decorum and fortune him accordingly!,6
Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a,6
they'ld do't!,6
Not he; the queen.,6
Saw you my lord?,6
Was he not here?,6
He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden,6
Madam?,6
Where's Alexas?,6
We will not look upon him: go with us.,6
Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants,6
Against my brother Lucius?,6
But soon that war had end and the time's state,6
Whose better issue in the war from Italy,6
Well what worst?,6
When it concerns the fool or coward. On:,6
Who tells me true though in his tale lie death,6
Labienus--,6
Extended Asia from Euphrates;,6
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--,6
O my lord!,6
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;,6
With such full licence as both truth and malice,6
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us,6
At your noble pleasure.,6
From Sicyon ho the news! Speak there!,6
He stays upon your will.,6
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,6
Enter another Messenger,6
Fulvia thy wife is dead.,6
In Sicyon:,6
Importeth thee to know this bears.,6
Forbear me.,6
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:,6
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,6
The opposite of itself: she's good being gone;,6
I must from this enchanting queen break off:,6
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!,6
What's your pleasure sir?,6
Why then we kill all our women:,6
if they suffer our departure death's the word.,6
Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were,6
them and a great cause they should be esteemed,6
this dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty,6
mettle in death which commits some loving act upon,6
She is cunning past man's thought.,6
Alack sir no; her passions are made of nothing but,6
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater,6
cannot be cunning in her; if it be she makes a,6
Would I had never seen her.,6
of work; which not to have been blest withal would,6
Fulvia is dead.,6
Fulvia is dead.,6
Dead.,6
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man,6
comforting therein that when old robes are worn,6
no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut,6
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new,6
that should water this sorrow.,6
Cannot endure my absence.,6
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's which,6
No more light answers. Let our officers,6
The cause of our expedience to the queen,6
The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches,6
Of many our contriving friends in Rome,6
Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands,6
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver,6
Pompey the Great and all his dignities,6
Higher than both in blood and life stands up,6
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,6
And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,6
Our quick remove from hence.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and ALEXAS,6
I did not see him since.,6
I did not send you: if you find him sad,6
That I am sudden sick: quick and return.,6
Madam methinks if you did love him dearly,6
The like from him.,6
In each thing give him way cross him nothing.,6
Tempt him not so too far; I wish forbear:,6
But here comes Antony.,6
I am sick and sullen.,6
Help me away dear Charmian; I shall fall:,6
Will not sustain it.,6
Pray you stand further from me.,6
I know by that same eye there's some good news.,6
Would she had never given you leave to come!,6
I have no power upon you; hers you are.,6
O never was there queen,6
I saw the treasons planted.,6
Why should I think you can be mine and true,6
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,6
Which break themselves in swearing!,6
Nay pray you seek no colour for your going,6
Then was the time for words: no going then;,6
Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,6
Or thou the greatest soldier of the world,6
How now lady!,6
There were a heart in Egypt.,6
The strong necessity of time commands,6
Remains in use with you. Our Italy,6
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:,6
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated grown to strength,6
Rich in his father's honour creeps apace,6
Upon the present state whose numbers threaten;,6
By any desperate change: my more particular,6
Is Fulvia's death.,6
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?,6
Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read,6
See when and where she died.,6
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill,6
In Fulvia's death how mine received shall be.,6
The purposes I bear; which are or cease,6
That quickens Nilus' slime I go from hence,6
As thou affect'st.,6
But let it be: I am quickly ill and well,6
My precious queen forbear;,6
An honourable trial.,6
I prithee turn aside and weep for her,6
Belong to Egypt: good now play one scene,6
Life perfect honour.,6
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.,6
And target. Still he mends;,6
How this Herculean Roman does become,6
I'll leave you lady.,6
Sir you and I must part but that's not it:,6
That you know well: something it is I would,6
And I am all forgotten.,6
Holds idleness your subject I should take you,6
Tis sweating labour,6
As Cleopatra this. But sir forgive me;,6
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;,6
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword,6
Be strew'd before your feet!,6
Our separation so abides and flies,6
And I hence fleeting here remain with thee. Away!,6
SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.,6
You may see Lepidus and henceforth know,6
Our great competitor: from Alexandria,6
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like,6
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience or,6
A man who is the abstract of all faults,6
I must not think there are,6
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,6
Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,6
You are too indulgent. Let us grant it is not,6
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit,6
To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet,6
becomes him--,6
Whom these things cannot blemish--yet must Antony,6
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd,6
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones,6
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud,6
As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge,6
And so rebel to judgment.,6
Here's more news.,6
Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report,6
And it appears he is beloved of those,6
The discontents repair and men's reports,6
I should have known no less.,6
That he which is was wish'd until he were;,6
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,6
Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide,6
Caesar I bring thee word,6
Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound,6
They make in Italy; the borders maritime,6
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon,6
Than could his war resisted.,6
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once,6
Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel,6
Though daintily brought up with patience more,6
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle,6
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;,6
The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps,6
Which some did die to look on: and all this--,6
Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek,6
Tis pity of him.,6
Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain,6
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey,6
To-morrow Caesar,6
Both what by sea and land I can be able,6
Till which encounter,6
Farewell my lord: what you shall know meantime,6
To let me be partaker.,6
I knew it for my bond.,6
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
Charmian!,6
Ha ha!,6
Why madam?,6
My Antony is away.,6
O 'tis treason!,6
Thou eunuch Mardian!,6
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure,6
That being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts,6
Yes gracious madam.,6
Not in deed madam; for I can do nothing,6
Yet have I fierce affections and think,6
O Charmian,6
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?,6
Do bravely horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?,6
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,6
For so he calls me: now I feed myself,6
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,6
When thou wast here above the ground I was,6
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;,6
With looking on his life.,6
Sovereign of Egypt hail!,6
Yet coming from him that great medicine hath,6
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?,6
He kiss'd--the last of many doubled kisses--,6
Mine ear must pluck it thence.,6
Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends,6
To mend the petty present I will piece,6
Say thou shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,6
Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke,6
What was he sad or merry?,6
Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry.,6
Note him good Charmian 'tis the man; but note him:,6
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,6
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:,6
The violence of either thee becomes,6
Ay madam twenty several messengers:,6
Who's born that day,6
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper Charmian.,6
Ever love Caesar so?,6
Be choked with such another emphasis!,6
The valiant Caesar!,6
If thou with Caesar paragon again,6
By your most gracious pardon,6
My salad days,6
To say as I said then! But come away;,6
He shall have every day a several greeting,6
Exeunt,6
SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.,6
If the great gods be just they shall assist,6
Know worthy Pompey,6
Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays,6
We ignorant of ourselves,6
Deny us for our good; so find we profit,6
I shall do well:,6
My powers are crescent and my auguring hope,6
In Egypt sits at dinner and will make,6
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,6
Nor either cares for him.,6
Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.,6
From Silvius sir.,6
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,6
Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both!,6
Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks,6
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour,6
Enter VARRIUS,6
This is most certain that I shall deliver:,6
Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis,6
I could have given less matter,6
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm,6
Is twice the other twain: but let us rear,6
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck,6
I cannot hope,6
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;,6
Not moved by Antony.,6
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.,6
Twere pregnant they should square between,6
For they have entertained cause enough,6
May cement their divisions and bind up,6
Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands,6
Come Menas.,6
SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.,6
Good Enobarbus 'tis a worthy deed,6
To soft and gentle speech.,6
To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,6
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,6
I would not shave't to-day.,6
For private stomaching.,6
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.,6
Not if the small come first.,6
But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MECAENAS and AGRIPPA,6
Hark Ventidius.,6
Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.,6
That which combined us was most great and let not,6
May it be gently heard: when we debate,6
Murder in healing wounds: then noble partners,6
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,6
Tis spoken well.,6
I should do thus.,6
Welcome to Rome.,6
Sit.,6
Nay then.,6
Or being concern you not.,6
If or for nothing or a little I,6
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should,6
It not concern'd me.,6
What was't to you?,6
Might be to you in Egypt: yet if you there,6
Might be my question.,6
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent,6
Made wars upon me; and their contestation,6
You do mistake your business; my brother never,6
And have my learning from some true reports,6
Discredit my authority with yours;,6
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters,6
As matter whole you have not to make it with,6
You praise yourself,6
You patch'd up your excuses.,6
I know you could not lack I am certain on't,6
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,6
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,6
The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle,6
Would we had all such wives that the men might go,6
So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar,6
Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant,6
But say I could not help it.,6
When rioting in Alexandria; you,6
Did gibe my missive out of audience.,6
He fell upon me ere admitted: then,6
Of what I was i' the morning: but next day,6
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow,6
Out of our question wipe him.,6
The article of your oath; which you shall never,6
Soft Caesar!,6
Lepidus let him speak:,6
Supposing that I lack'd it. But on Caesar;,6
To lend me arms and aid when I required them;,6
Neglected rather;,6
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,6
Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power,6
To have me out of Egypt made wars here;,6
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour,6
Tis noble spoken.,6
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite,6
Speaks to atone you.,6
Or if you borrow one another's love for the,6
Pompey return it again: you shall have time to,6
Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.,6
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.,6
I do not much dislike the matter but,6
We shall remain in friendship our conditions,6
What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge,6
Give me leave Caesar--,6
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,6
Is now a widower.,6
If Cleopatra heard you your reproof,6
I am not married Caesar: let me hear,6
To hold you in perpetual amity,6
With an unslipping  knot take Antony,6
No worse a husband than the best of men;,6
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,6
And all great fears which now import their dangers,6
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both,6
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;,6
By duty ruminated.,6
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd,6
What power is in Agrippa,6
To make this good?,6
His power unto Octavia.,6
To this good purpose that so fairly shows,6
Further this act of grace: and from this hour,6
And sway our great designs!,6
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother,6
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never,6
Happily amen!,6
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great,6
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;,6
Time calls upon's:,6
Or else he seeks out us.,6
About the mount Misenum.,6
Great and increasing: but by sea,6
So is the fame.,6
Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we,6
With most gladness:,6
Whither straight I'll lead you.,6
Not lack your company.,6
Not sickness should detain me.,6
Welcome from Egypt sir.,6
honourable friend Agrippa!,6
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well,6
Ay sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and,6
Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast and,6
This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more,6
She's a most triumphant lady if report be square to,6
When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up,6
There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised,6
I will tell you.,6
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;,6
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,6
The water which they beat to follow faster,6
It beggar'd all description: she did lie,6
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see,6
Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids,6
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,6
O rare for Antony!,6
So many mermaids tended her i' the eyes,6
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle,6
That yarely frame the office. From the barge,6
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast,6
Enthroned i' the market-place did sit alone,6
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,6
Rare Egyptian!,6
Invited her to supper: she replied,6
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,6
Being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast,6
For what his eyes eat only.,6
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:,6
I saw her once,6
And having lost her breath she spoke and panted,6
And breathless power breathe forth.,6
Never; he will not:,6
Her infinite variety: other women cloy,6
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things,6
Bless her when she is riggish.,6
The heart of Antony Octavia is,6
Let us go.,6
Whilst you abide here.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY OCTAVIUS CAESAR OCTAVIA between them and Attendants,6
Divide me from your bosom.,6
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers,6
Good night sir. My Octavia,6
I have not kept my square; but that to come,6
Good night sir.,6
Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA,6
Now sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?,6
If you can your reason?,6
My motion have it not in my tongue: but yet,6
Say to me,6
Caesar's.,6
Thy demon that's thy spirit which keeps thee is,6
Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel,6
Make space enough between you.,6
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.,6
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck,6
When he shines by: I say again thy spirit,6
But he away 'tis noble.,6
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:,6
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,6
And in our sports my better cunning faints,6
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,6
Beat mine inhoop'd at odds. I will to Egypt:,6
I' the east my pleasure lies.,6
O come Ventidius,6
Follow me and receive't.,6
SCENE IV. The same. A street.,6
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you hasten,6
Sir Mark Antony,6
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,6
We shall,6
Before you Lepidus.,6
My purposes do draw me much about:,6
Sir good success!,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and ALEXAS,6
Of us that trade in love.,6
Enter MARDIAN,6
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.,6
As with a woman. Come you'll play with me sir?,6
And when good will is show'd though't come,6
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:,6
My music playing far off I will betray,6
Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up,6
And say 'Ah ha! you're caught.',6
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver,6
With fervency drew up.,6
I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night,6
Ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed;,6
I wore his sword Philippan.,6
O from Italy,6
That long time have been barren.,6
Antonius dead!--If thou say so villain,6
If thou so yield him there is gold and here,6
Have lipp'd and trembled kissing.,6
Why there's more gold.,6
To say the dead are well: bring it to that,6
Down thy ill-uttering throat.,6
Well go to I will;,6
Be free and healthful--so tart a favour,6
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,6
Will't please you hear me?,6
Yet if thou say Antony lives is well,6
I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail,6
Madam he's well.,6
And friends with Caesar.,6
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.,6
But yet madam--,6
The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!,6
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee friend,6
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:,6
Free madam! no; I made no such report:,6
For what good turn?,6
I am pale Charmian.,6
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!,6
Good madam patience.,6
Strikes him again,6
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:,6
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,6
Gracious madam,6
Say 'tis not so a province I will give thee,6
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;,6
Thy modesty can beg.,6
Rogue thou hast lived too long.,6
Nay then I'll run.,6
Exit,6
The man is innocent.,6
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures,6
Though I am mad I will not bite him: call.,6
I will not hurt him.,6
These hands do lack nobility that they strike,6
Have given myself the cause.,6
Come hither sir.,6
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.,6
Themselves when they be felt.,6
Is he married?,6
If thou again say 'Yes.',6
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?,6
O I would thou didst,6
A cistern for scaled snakes! Go get thee hence:,6
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?,6
He is married?,6
To punish me for what you make me do.,6
O that his fault should make a knave of thee,6
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome,6
And be undone by 'em!,6
Good your highness patience.,6
Many times madam.,6
Lead me from hence:,6
Go to the fellow good Alexas; bid him,6
Her inclination let him not leave out,6
Exit ALEXAS,6
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,6
To MARDIAN,6
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.,6
SCENE VI. Near Misenum.,6
Your hostages I have so have you mine;,6
Most meet,6
Our written purposes before us sent;,6
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,6
That else must perish here.,6
The senators alone of this great world,6
Wherefore my father should revengers want,6
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,6
That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what,6
With the arm'd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom,6
Have one man but a man? And that is it,6
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant,6
Cast on my noble father.,6
Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails;,6
How much we do o'er-count thee.,6
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:,6
Remain in't as thou mayst.,6
For this is from the present--how you take,6
There's the point.,6
What it is worth embraced.,6
To try a larger fortune.,6
Of Sicily Sardinia; and I must,6
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,6
Our targes undinted.,6
Know then,6
To take this offer: but Mark Antony,6
The praise of it by telling you must know,6
Your mother came to Sicily and did find,6
I have heard it Pompey;,6
Which I do owe you.,6
I did not think sir to have met you here.,6
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;,6
Since I saw you last,6
Well I know not,6
But in my bosom shall she never come,6
Well met here.,6
I crave our composition may be written,6
That's the next to do.,6
Draw lots who shall begin.,6
No Antony take the lot: but first,6
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar,6
You have heard much.,6
And fair words to them.,6
And I have heard Apollodorus carried--,6
What I pray you?,6
I know thee now: how farest thou soldier?,6
And well am like to do; for I perceive,6
Let me shake thy hand;,6
When I have envied thy behavior.,6
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,6
As I have said you did.,6
It nothing ill becomes thee.,6
Will you lead lords?,6
Come.,6
[Aside]  Thy father Pompey would ne'er have,6
At sea I think.,6
You have done well by water.,6
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it,6
Nor what I have done by water.,6
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.,6
There I deny my land service. But give me your,6
might take two thieves kissing.,6
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.,6
We came hither to fight with you.,6
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.,6
You've said sir. We looked not for Mark Antony,6
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.,6
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.,6
Tis true.,6
If I were bound to divine of this unity I would,6
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the,6
I think so too. But you shall find the band that,6
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a,6
Who would not have his wife so?,6
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the,6
I said before that which is the strength of their,6
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:,6
And thus it may be. Come sir will you aboard?,6
I shall take it sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.,6
Exeunt,6
Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet,6
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world,6
Lepidus is high-coloured.,6
As they pinch one another by the disposition he,6
entreaty and himself to the drink.,6
his discretion.,6
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do,6
To be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen,6
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.,6
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they sir: they take,6
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,6
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,6
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,6
You've strange serpents there.,6
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the,6
They are so.,6
I am not so well as I should be but I'll ne'er out.,6
Nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies',6
contradiction I have heard that.,6
[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:,6
[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat I do beseech,6
And hear me speak a word.,6
This wine for Lepidus!,6
It is shaped sir like itself; and it is as broad,6
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that,6
it it transmigrates.,6
Of it own colour too.,6
Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.,6
With the health that Pompey gives him else he is a,6
[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang sir hang! Tell me of,6
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?,6
wilt hear me,6
[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.,6
Rises and walks aside,6
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?,6
These quick-sands Lepidus,6
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?,6
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.,6
But entertain it,6
Will give thee all the world.,6
Now Pompey I have kept me from the cup.,6
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips,6
Show me which way.,6
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;,6
All there is thine.,6
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;,6
Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;,6
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,6
But must condemn it now. Desist and drink.,6
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.,6
Shall never find it more.,6
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him Pompey.,6
Enobarbus welcome!,6
There's a strong fellow Menas.,6
Why?,6
not?,6
That it might go on wheels!,6
Come.,6
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels ho?,6
I could well forbear't.,6
And it grows fouler.,6
Possess it I'll make answer:,6
Than drink so much in one.,6
To MARK ANTONY,6
And celebrate our drink?,6
Come let's all take hands,6
In soft and delicate Lethe.,6
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:,6
The holding every man shall bear as loud,6
Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand,6
Come thou monarch of the vine,6
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,6
Cup us till the world go round,6
What would you more? Pompey good night. Good brother,6
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords let's part;,6
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue,6
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.,6
I'll try you on the shore.,6
O Antony,6
Come down into the boat.,6
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS,6
No to my cabin.,6
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell,6
Sound a flourish with drums,6
Ho! Noble captain come.,6
ACT III,6
Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph with SILIUS  and other Romans Officers and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him,6
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death,6
Before our army. Thy Pacorus Orodes,6
Noble Ventidius,6
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,6
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony,6
Put garlands on thy head.,6
I have done enough; a lower place note well,6
Better to leave undone than by our deed,6
Caesar and Antony have ever won,6
One of my place in Syria his lieutenant,6
Which he achieved by the minute lost his favour.,6
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,6
Than gain which darkens him.,6
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence,6
Thou hast Ventidius,6
Without the which a soldier and his sword,6
I'll humbly signify what in his name,6
How with his banners and his well-paid ranks,6
We have jaded out o' the field.,6
He purposeth to Athens: whither with what haste,6
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!,6
SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.,6
What are the brothers parted?,6
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps,6
Since Pompey's feast as Menas says is troubled,6
Tis a noble Lepidus.,6
Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!,6
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.,6
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!,6
Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises.,6
Ho! hearts tongues figures scribes bards,6
Think speak cast write sing number ho!,6
Kneel down kneel down and wonder.,6
They are his shards and he their beetle.,6
So;,6
Good fortune worthy soldier; and farewell.,6
No further sir.,6
Use me well in 't. Sister prove such a wife,6
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,6
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,6
The fortress of it; for better might we,6
This be not cherish'd.,6
In your distrust.,6
You shall not find,6
For what you seem to fear: so the gods keep you,6
We will here part.,6
The elements be kind to thee and make,6
My noble brother!,6
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.,6
What Octavia?,6
Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can,6
down-feather,6
And neither way inclines.,6
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.,6
were he a horse;,6
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why Enobarbus,6
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept,6
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year indeed he was,6
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,6
No sweet Octavia,6
Out-go my thinking on you.,6
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:,6
And give you to the gods.,6
Let all the number of the stars give light,6
Farewell fa rewell!,6
Farewell!,6
SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
Where is the fellow?,6
Go to go to.,6
Come hither sir.,6
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you,6
That Herod's head,6
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.,6
Didst thou behold Octavia?,6
Where?,6
I look'd her in the face and saw her led,6
Is she as tall as me?,6
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?,6
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.,6
I think so Charmian: dull of tongue and dwarfish!,6
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.,6
Her motion and her station are as one;,6
A statue than a breather.,6
Or I have no observance.,6
Cannot make better note.,6
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:,6
Excellent.,6
Madam,6
Widow! Charmian hark.,6
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?,6
For the most part too they are foolish that are so.,6
Brown madam: and her forehead,6
There's gold for thee.,6
I will employ thee back again; I find thee,6
Our letters are prepared.,6
A proper man.,6
That so I harried him. Why methinks by him,6
Nothing madam.,6
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,6
I have one thing more to ask him yet good Charmian:,6
Where I will write. All may be well enough.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA,6
That were excusable that and thousands more,6
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will and read it,6
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not,6
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:,6
Or did it from his teeth.,6
Believe not all; or if you must believe,6
If this division chance ne'er stood between,6
The good gods me presently,6
Undo that prayer by crying out as loud,6
Prays and destroys the prayer; no midway,6
Gentle Octavia,6
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,6
Than yours so branchless. But as you requested,6
I'll raise the preparation of a war,6
So your desires are yours.,6
The Jove of power make me most weak most weak,6
As if the world should cleave and that slain men,6
When it appears to you where this begins,6
Can never be so equal that your love,6
Choose your own company and command what cost,6
Exeunt,6
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS meeting,6
There's strange news come sir.,6
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.,6
Caesar having made use of him in the wars 'gainst,6
him partake in the glory of the action: and not,6
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him: so,6
Then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more;,6
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?,6
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!',6
That murder'd Pompey.,6
For Italy and Caesar. More Domitius;,6
I might have told hereafter.,6
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA and MECAENAS,6
In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:,6
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold,6
Caesarion whom they call my father's son,6
Since then hath made between them. Unto her,6
Of lower Syria Cyprus Lydia,6
This in the public eye?,6
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:,6
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd,6
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis,6
As 'tis reported so.,6
Who queasy with his insolence,6
The people know it; and have now received,6
Who does he accuse?,6
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him,6
Some shipping unrestored: lastly he frets,6
Should be deposed; and being that we detain,6
Sir this should be answer'd.,6
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel;,6
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,6
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms I,6
He'll never yield to that.,6
Enter OCTAVIA with her train,6
That ever I should call thee castaway!,6
Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not,6
Should have an army for an usher and,6
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way,6
Longing for what it had not; nay the dust,6
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come,6
The ostentation of our love which left unshown,6
By sea and land; supplying every stage,6
Good my lord,6
On my free will. My lord Mark Antony,6
My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd,6
Which soon he granted,6
Do not say so my lord.,6
And his affairs come to me on the wind.,6
My lord in Athens.,6
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire,6
The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled,6
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos king,6
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;,6
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,6
With a more larger list of sceptres.,6
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,6
Welcome hither:,6
Till we perceived both how you were wrong led,6
Be you not troubled with the time which drives,6
But let determined things to destiny,6
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused,6
To do you justice make them ministers,6
And ever welcome to us.,6
Welcome dear madam.,6
Only the adulterous Antony most large,6
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,6
Is it so sir?,6
Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!,6
SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.,6
I will be even with thee doubt it not.,6
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,6
Well is it is it?,6
Be there in person?,6
If we should serve with horse and mares together,6
A soldier and his horse.,6
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;,6
from's time,6
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome,6
Manage this war.,6
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,6
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:,6
Nay I have done.,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS,6
That from Tarentum and Brundusium,6
And take in Toryne? You have heard on't sweet?,6
Than by the negligent.,6
Which might have well becomed the best of men,6
Will fight with him by sea.,6
Why will my lord do so?,6
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.,6
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,6
And so should you.,6
Your mariners are muleters reapers people,6
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:,6
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,6
By sea by sea.,6
The absolute soldiership you have by land;,6
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted,6
The way which promises assurance; and,6
From firm security.,6
I have sixty sails Caesar none better.,6
And with the rest full-mann'd from the head of Actium,6
We then can do't at land.,6
Thy business?,6
Caesar has taken Toryne.,6
Strange that power should be. Canidius,6
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:,6
Enter a Soldier,6
O noble emperor do not fight by sea;,6
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians,6
Have used to conquer standing on the earth,6
Well well: away!,6
By Hercules I think I am i' the right.,6
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,6
You keep by land,6
Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius,6
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's,6
While he was yet in Rome,6
Beguiled all spies.,6
They say one Taurus.,6
Enter a Messenger,6
With news the time's with labour and throes forth,6
Exeunt,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and TAURUS with his army marching,6
My lord?,6
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed,6
Upon this jump.,6
SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.,6
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,6
We may the number of the ships behold,6
Exeunt,6
CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage; and TAURUS the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS  CAESAR the other way. After their going in is heard the noise of a sea-fight,6
Naught naught all naught! I can behold no longer:,6
With all their sixty fly and turn the rudder:,6
Enter SCARUS,6
All the whole synod of them!,6
The greater cantle of the world is lost,6
Kingdoms and provinces.,6
On our side like the token'd pestilence,6
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,6
Both as the same or rather ours the elder,6
Hoists sails and flies.,6
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not,6
She once being loof'd,6
Claps on his sea-wing and like a doting mallard,6
I never saw an action of such shame;,6
Did violate so itself.,6
Enter CANIDIUS,6
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general,6
O he has given example for our flight,6
Ay are you thereabouts?,6
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.,6
What further comes.,6
My legions and my horse: six kings already,6
I'll yet follow,6
Sits in the wind against me.,6
SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;,6
I am so lated in the world that I,6
Laden with gold; take that divide it; fly,6
Fly! not we.,6
To run and show their shoulders. Friends be gone;,6
Which has no need of you; be gone:,6
I follow'd that I blush to look upon:,6
Reprove the brown for rashness and they them,6
Have letters from me to some friends that will,6
Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint,6
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:,6
Leave me I pray a little: pray you now:,6
Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.,6
Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following,6
Do most dear queen.,6
Let me sit down. O Juno!,6
See you here sir?,6
Madam!,6
Sir sir--,6
His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck,6
That the mad Brutus ended: he alone,6
In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.,6
The queen my lord the queen.,6
He is unqualitied with very shame.,6
Most noble sir arise; the queen approaches:,6
Your comfort makes the rescue.,6
A most unnoble swerving.,6
O whither hast thou led me Egypt? See,6
By looking back what I have left behind,6
O my lord my lord,6
You would have follow'd.,6
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,6
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that,6
Command me.,6
Now I must,6
And palter in the shifts of lowness; who,6
Making and marring fortunes. You did know,6
My sword made weak by my affection would,6
Pardon pardon!,6
All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;,6
Is he come back? Love I am full of lead.,6
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.,6
SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.,6
Let him appear that's come from Antony.,6
Caesar 'tis his schoolmaster:,6
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,6
Not many moons gone by.,6
Approach and speak.,6
I was of late as petty to his ends,6
To his grand sea.,6
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and,6
He lessens his requests; and to thee sues,6
A private man in Athens: this for him.,6
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves,6
Now hazarded to thy grace.,6
I have no ears to his request. The queen,6
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,6
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.,6
Bring him through the bands.,6
To THYREUS,6
And in our name what she requires; add more,6
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure,6
Make thine own edict for thy pains which we,6
Caesar I go.,6
And what thou think'st his very action speaks,6
Caesar I shall.,6
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
What shall we do Enobarbus?,6
Is Antony or we in fault for this?,6
Lord of his reason. What though you fled,6
Frighted each other? why should he follow?,6
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,6
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less,6
And leave his navy gazing.,6
Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS the Ambassador,6
Ay my lord.,6
Will yield us up.,6
Let her know't.,6
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim,6
That head my lord?,6
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note,6
May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail,6
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore,6
And answer me declined sword against sword,6
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS,6
Unstate his happiness and be staged to the show,6
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward,6
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,6
Answer his emptiness! Caesar thou hast subdued,6
Enter an Attendant,6
What no more ceremony? See my women!,6
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him sir.,6
[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.,6
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure,6
Does conquer him that did his master conquer,6
Enter THYREUS,6
Hear it apart.,6
So haply are they friends to Antony.,6
Or needs not us. If Caesar please our master,6
Whose he is we are and that is Caesar's.,6
Thus then thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,6
Further than he is Caesar.,6
He knows that you embrace not Antony,6
O!,6
Does pity as constrained blemishes,6
He is a god and knows,6
But conquer'd merely.,6
I will ask Antony. Sir sir thou art so leaky,6
Thy dearest quit thee.,6
Shall I say to Caesar,6
To be desired to give. It much would please him,6
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,6
And put yourself under his shrowd,6
What's your name?,6
Most kind messenger,6
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him I am prompt,6
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear,6
Tis your noblest course.,6
If that the former dare but what it can,6
My duty on your hand.,6
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,6
As it rain'd kisses.,6
Favours by Jove that thunders!,6
One that but performs,6
To have command obey'd.,6
Approach there! Ah you kite! Now gods,6
Authority melts from me: of late when I cried 'Ho!',6
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am,6
Enter Attendants,6
[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp,6
Moon and stars!,6
That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them,6
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him fellows,6
And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.,6
Tug him away: being whipp'd,6
Bear us an errand to him.,6
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!,6
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,6
By one that looks on feeders?,6
You have been a boggler ever:,6
O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;,6
Adore our errors; laugh at's while we strut,6
O is't come to this?,6
Dead Caesar's trencher; nay you were a fragment,6
Unregister'd in vulgar fame you have,6
Though you can guess what temperance should be,6
Wherefore is this?,6
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with,6
And plighter of high hearts! O that I were,6
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;,6
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank,6
Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS,6
Soundly my lord.,6
He did ask favour.,6
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry,6
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth,6
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,6
He makes me angry with him; for he seems,6
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;,6
When my good stars that were my former guides,6
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike,6
Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom,6
As he shall like to quit me: urge it thou:,6
Exit THYREUS,6
Alack our terrene moon,6
The fall of Antony!,6
To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes,6
Not know me yet?,6
Ah dear if I be so,6
And poison it in the source; and the first stone,6
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!,6
Together with my brave Egyptians all,6
Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile,6
I am satisfied.,6
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land,6
Have knit again and fleet threatening most sea-like.,6
If from the field I shall return once more,6
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:,6
That's my brave lord!,6
And fight maliciously: for when mine hours,6
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,6
Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me,6
Let's mock the midnight bell.,6
I had thought to have held it poor: but since my lord,6
We will yet do well.,6
Do so we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force,6
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,6
Even with his pestilent scythe.,6
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,6
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,6
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,6
Some way to leave him.,6
ACT IV,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA and MECAENAS with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter,6
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger,6
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know,6
Laugh at his challenge.,6
When one so great begins to rage he's hunted,6
Make boot of his distraction: never anger,6
Let our best heads,6
We mean to fight: within our files there are,6
Enough to fetch him in. See it done:,6
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!,6
SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
He will not fight with me Domitius.,6
Why should he not?,6
He is twenty men to one.,6
By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,6
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?,6
Well said; come on.,6
Be bounteous at our meal.,6
Give me thy hand,6
Thou--and thou--and thou:--you have served me well,6
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?,6
tricks which sorrow shoots,6
And thou art honest too.,6
And all of you clapp'd up together in,6
So good as you have done.,6
Well my good fellows wait on me to-night:,6
As when mine empire was your fellow too,6
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?,6
Tend me to-night;,6
Haply you shall not see me more; or if,6
You'll serve another master. I look on you,6
I turn you not away; but like a master,6
Tend me to-night two hours I ask no more,6
What mean you sir,6
And I an ass am onion-eyed: for shame,6
Ho ho ho!,6
Grace grow where those drops fall!,6
You take me in too dolorous a sense;,6
To burn this night with torches: know my hearts,6
Where rather I'll expect victorious life,6
And drown consideration.,6
SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.,6
Brother good night: to-morrow is the day.,6
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?,6
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.,6
Enter two other Soldiers,6
And you. Good night good night.,6
Here we: and if to-morrow,6
Our landmen will stand up.,6
And full of purpose.,6
Peace! what noise?,6
Hark!,6
Under the earth.,6
No.,6
What should this mean?,6
Now leaves him.,6
Do hear what we do?,6
How now masters!,6
How now! do you hear this?,6
Do you hear masters? do you hear?,6
Let's see how it will give off.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN and others attending,6
Sleep a little.,6
Enter EROS with armour,6
If fortune be not ours to-day it is,6
Nay I'll help too.,6
Ah let be let be! thou art,6
Sooth la I'll help: thus it must be.,6
We shall thrive now. Seest thou my good fellow?,6
Briefly sir.,6
Rarely rarely:,6
To daff't for our repose shall hear a storm.,6
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,6
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see,6
Enter an armed Soldier,6
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:,6
And go to't with delight.,6
Early though't be have on their riveted trim,6
Shout. Trumpets flourish,6
The morn is fair. Good morrow general.,6
Tis well blown lads:,6
That means to be of note begins betimes.,6
Fare thee well dame whate'er becomes of me:,6
Kisses her,6
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee,6
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.,6
Please you retire to your chamber.,6
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might,6
Then Antony--but now--Well on.,6
SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.,6
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!,6
To make me fight at land!,6
The kings that have revolted and the soldier,6
Follow'd thy heels.,6
Who!,6
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp,6
What say'st thou?,6
He is with Caesar.,6
He has not with him.,6
Most certain.,6
Detain no jot I charge thee: write to him--,6
Say that I wish he never find more cause,6
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!,6
SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.,6
Go forth Agrippa and begin the fight:,6
Make it so known.,6
Exit,6
Prove this a prosperous day the three-nook'd world,6
Enter a Messenger,6
Is come into the field.,6
Plant those that have revolted in the van,6
Upon himself.,6
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on,6
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,6
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest,6
No honourable trust. I have done ill;,6
That I will joy no more.,6
Enobarbus Antony,6
His bounty overplus: the messenger,6
Unloading of his mules.,6
Mock not Enobarbus.,6
Out of the host; I must attend mine office,6
Continues still a Jove.,6
I am alone the villain of the earth,6
Thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid,6
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:,6
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't I feel.,6
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits,6
Exit,6
Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others,6
Caesar himself has work and our oppression,6
Exeunt,6
O my brave emperor this is fought indeed!,6
With clouts about their heads.,6
I had a wound here that was like a T,6
They do retire.,6
Room for six scotches more.,6
They are beaten sir and our advantage serves,6
Let us score their backs,6
Tis sport to maul a runner.,6
Once for thy spritely comfort and ten-fold,6
I'll halt after.,6
SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.,6
We have beat him to his camp: run one before,6
Before the sun shall see 's we'll spill the blood,6
For doughty-handed are you and have fought,6
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.,6
Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears,6
The honour'd gashes whole.,6
Give me thy hand,6
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,6
To CLEOPATRA,6
Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou attire and all,6
Ride on the pants triumphing!,6
O infinite virtue comest thou smiling from,6
My nightingale,6
though grey,6
A brain that nourishes our nerves and can,6
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:,6
As if a god in hate of mankind had,6
I'll give thee friend,6
He has deserved it were it carbuncled,6
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;,6
Had our great palace the capacity,6
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,6
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;,6
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,6
Exeunt,6
Sentinels at their post,6
We must return to the court of guard: the night,6
By the second hour i' the morn.,6
A shrewd one to's.,6
O bear me witness night--,6
Stand close and list him.,6
When men revolted shall upon record,6
Before thy face repent!,6
Peace!,6
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,6
That life a very rebel to my will,6
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:,6
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,6
Forgive me in thine own particular;,6
A master-leaver and a fugitive:,6
Dies,6
Let's hear him for the things he speaks,6
Let's do so. But he sleeps.,6
Was never yet for sleep.,6
Awake sir awake; speak to us.,6
The hand of death hath raught him.,6
Hark! the drums,6
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour,6
Come on then;,6
Exeunt with the body,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS with their Army,6
We please them not by land.,6
I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;,6
Upon the hills adjoining to the city,6
They have put forth the haven,6
And look on their endeavour.,6
SCENE XI. Another part of the same.,6
But being charged we will be still by land,6
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS,6
does stand,6
Straight how 'tis like to go.,6
Swallows have built,6
Say they know not they cannot tell; look grimly,6
Is valiant and dejected; and by starts,6
Of what he has and has not.,6
Re-enter MARK ANTONY,6
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:,6
They cast their caps up and carouse together,6
tis thou,6
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;,6
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.,6
O sun thy uprise shall I see no more:,6
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts,6
Their wishes do discandy melt their sweets,6
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:,6
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home;,6
Like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose,6
What Eros Eros!,6
Ah thou spell! Avaunt!,6
Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving,6
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:,6
Of all thy sex; most monster-like be shown,6
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up,6
Exit CLEOPATRA,6
If it be well to live; but better 'twere,6
Might have prevented many. Eros ho!,6
Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage:,6
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club,6
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me and I fall,6
Exit,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN,6
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly,6
To the monument!,6
The soul and body rive not more in parting,6
To the monument!,6
Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony',6
And bring me how he takes my death.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS,6
Ay noble lord.,6
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,6
A forked mountain or blue promontory,6
And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen,6
They are black vesper's pageants.,6
That which is now a horse even with a thought,6
As water is in water.,6
My good knave Eros now thy captain is,6
Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave.,6
Whose heart I thought I had for she had mine;,6
A million more now lost--she Eros has,6
Unto an enemy's triumph.,6
Ourselves to end ourselves.,6
O! thy vile lady!,6
No Antony;,6
With thine entirely.,6
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.,6
And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do,6
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!',6
The name of Antony; it was divided,6
Thy name so buried in her.,6
Dead.,6
And we must sleep.,6
That thou depart'st hence safe,6
Exit MARDIAN,6
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep,6
Heart once be stronger than thy continent,6
No more a soldier: bruised pieces go;,6
Exit EROS,6
Weep for my pardon. So it must be for now,6
Lie down and stray no farther: now all labour,6
Itself with strength: seal then and all is done.,6
Where souls do couch on flowers we'll hand in hand,6
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,6
Re-enter EROS,6
Since Cleopatra died,6
Detest my baseness. I that with my sword,6
With ships made cities condemn myself to lack,6
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells,6
That when the exigent should come which now,6
The inevitable prosecution of,6
Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:,6
Put colour in thy cheek.,6
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,6
Eros,6
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms bending down,6
To penetrative shame whilst the wheel'd seat,6
His baseness that ensued?,6
Come then; for with a wound I must be cured.,6
Most useful for thy country.,6
When I did make thee free sworest thou not then,6
Or thy precedent services are all,6
Turn from me then that noble countenance,6
Lo thee!,6
My sword is drawn.,6
The thing why thou hast drawn it.,6
My captain and my emperor let me say,6
Tis said man; and farewell.,6
Now Eros.,6
Of Antony's death.,6
Thrice-nobler than myself!,6
I should and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros,6
A nobleness in record: but I will be,6
As to a lover's bed. Come then; and Eros,6
Falling on his sword,6
The guard ho! O dispatch me!,6
What's the noise?,6
Of what I have begun.,6
And time is at his period.,6
Let him that loves me strike me dead.,6
Nor I.,6
Exeunt Guard,6
This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings,6
Enter DIOMEDES,6
There Diomed there.,6
Wilt thou not answer man?,6
Art thou there Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me,6
Most absolute lord,6
When did she send thee?,6
Where is she?,6
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--,6
She had disposed with Caesar and that your rage,6
But fearing since how it might work hath sent,6
I dread too late.,6
What ho the emperor's guard! The guard what ho!,6
Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY,6
Tis the last service that I shall command you.,6
All your true followers out.,6
Nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate,6
Which comes to punish us and we punish it,6
I have led you oft: carry me now good friends,6
Exeunt bearing MARK ANTONY,6
Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft with CHARMIAN and IRAS,6
Be comforted dear madam.,6
All strange and terrible events are welcome,6
Proportion'd to our cause must be as great,6
Enter below DIOMEDES,6
His death's upon him but not dead.,6
His guard have brought him thither.,6
O sun,6
darkling stand,6
Antony Antony! Help Charmian help Iras help;,6
Peace!,6
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.,6
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!,6
I here importune death awhile until,6
I lay up thy lips.,6
Dear my lord pardon--I dare not,6
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall,6
serpents have,6
Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes,6
Demuring upon me. But come come Antony--,6
Assist good friends.,6
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!,6
That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,6
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little--,6
They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA,6
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,6
A heavy sight!,6
Give me some wine and let me speak a little.,6
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,6
One word sweet queen:,6
They do not go together.,6
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.,6
None about Caesar.,6
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts,6
Wherein I lived the greatest prince o' the world,6
Not cowardly put off my helmet to,6
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;,6
Noblest of men woo't die?,6
In this dull world which in thy absence is,6
MARK ANTONY dies,6
O wither'd is the garland of the war,6
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,6
Beneath the visiting moon.,6
O quietness lady!,6
Lady!,6
O madam madam madam!,6
Peace peace Iras!,6
By such poor passion as the maid that milks,6
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;,6
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;,6
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin,6
Ere death dare come to us? How do you women?,6
My noble girls! Ah women women look,6
We'll bury him; and then what's brave,6
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,6
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:,6
But resolution and the briefest end.,6
ACT V,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA DOLABELLA MECAENAS GALLUS PROCULEIUS and others his council of war,6
Being so frustrate tell him he mocks,6
Caesar I shall.,6
Enter DERCETAS with the sword of MARK ANTONY,6
Appear thus to us?,6
Mark Antony I served who best was worthy,6
He was my master; and I wore my life,6
To take me to thee as I was to him,6
I yield thee up my life.,6
I say O Caesar Antony is dead.,6
A greater crack: the round world,6
And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony,6
A moiety of the world.,6
Not by a public minister of justice,6
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,6
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;,6
With his most noble blood.,6
The gods rebuke me but it is tidings,6
And strange it is,6
Our most persisted deeds.,6
Waged equal with him.,6
Did steer humanity: but you gods will give us,6
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,6
O Antony!,6
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce,6
Or look on thine; we could not stall together,6
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,6
In top of all design my mate in empire,6
The arm of mine own body and the heart,6
Unreconciliable should divide,6
But I will tell you at some meeter season:,6
The business of this man looks out of him;,6
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,6
Of thy intents desires instruction,6
To the way she's forced to.,6
She soon shall know of us by some of ours,6
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live,6
So the gods preserve thee!,6
Come hither Proculeius. Go and say,6
The quality of her passion shall require,6
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome,6
And with your speediest bring us what she says,6
Caesar I shall.,6
Gallus go you along.,6
Where's Dolabella,6
Dolabella!,6
How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.,6
How hardly I was drawn into this war;,6
In all my writings: go with me and see,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN and IRAS,6
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;,6
A minister of her will: and it is great,6
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;,6
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.,6
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;,6
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.,6
My name is Proculeius.,6
Did tell me of you bade me trust you; but,6
That have no use for trusting. If your master,6
That majesty to keep decorum must,6
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,6
Will kneel to him with thanks.,6
You're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing:,6
Who is so full of grace that it flows over,6
Your sweet dependency; and you shall find,6
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.,6
I am his fortune's vassal and I send him,6
A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly,6
This I'll report dear lady.,6
Of him that caused it.,6
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window and  having descended come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates,6
Guard her till Caesar come.,6
Royal queen!,6
Quick quick good hands.,6
Hold worthy lady hold:,6
Do not yourself such wrong who are in this,6
What of death too,6
Cleopatra,6
The undoing of yourself: let the world see,6
Will never let come forth.,6
Come hither come! come come and take a queen,6
O temperance lady!,6
If idle talk will once be necessary,6
Do Caesar what he can. Know sir that I,6
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye,6
And show me to the shouting varletry,6
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud,6
Blow me into abhorring! rather make,6
And hang me up in chains!,6
These thoughts of horror further than you shall,6
Enter DOLABELLA,6
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,6
I'll take her to my guard.,6
It shall content me best: be gentle to her.,6
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,6
Say I would die.,6
Most noble empress you have heard of me?,6
Assuredly you know me.,6
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;,6
I understand not madam.,6
O such another sleep that I might see,6
If it might please ye--,6
A sun and moon which kept their course,6
The little O the earth.,6
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm,6
As all the tuned spheres and that to friends;,6
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,6
That grew the more by reaping: his delights,6
The element they lived in: in his livery,6
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.,6
Think you there was or might be such a man,6
Gentle madam no.,6
But if there be or ever were one such,6
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet to imagine,6
Condemning shadows quite.,6
Your loss is as yourself great; and you bear it,6
O'ertake pursued success but I do feel,6
My very heart at root.,6
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?,6
Nay pray you sir--,6
He'll lead me then in triumph?,6
Flourish and shout within 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!',6
Which is the Queen of Egypt?,6
CLEOPATRA kneels,6
I pray you rise; rise Egypt.,6
Will have it thus; my master and my lord,6
Take to you no hard thoughts:,6
Though written in our flesh we shall remember,6
Sole sir o' the world,6
To make it clear; but do confess I have,6
Have often shamed our sex.,6
We will extenuate rather than enforce:,6
Which towards you are most gentle you shall find,6
To lay on me a cruelty by taking,6
Of my good purposes and put your children,6
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.,6
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall,6
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.,6
I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;,6
Here madam.,6
Upon his peril that I have reserved,6
Madam,6
Speak that which is not.,6
Enough to purchase what you have made known.,6
Your wisdom in the deed.,6
How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;,6
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does,6
Than love that's hired! What goest thou back? thou shalt,6
Though they had wings: slave soulless villain dog!,6
Good queen let us entreat you.,6
That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,6
To one so meek that mine own servant should,6
Addition of his envy! Say good Caesar,6
Immoment toys things of such dignity,6
Some nobler token I have kept apart,6
Their mediation; must I be unfolded,6
Beneath the fall I have.,6
Prithee go hence;,6
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,6
Forbear Seleucus.,6
Be it known that we the greatest are misthought,6
We answer others' merits in our name,6
Cleopatra,6
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,6
Caesar's no merchant to make prize with you,6
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no dear queen;,6
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep:,6
That we remain your friend; and so adieu.,6
Not so. Adieu.,6
He words me girls he words me that I should not,6
Whispers CHARMIAN,6
And we are for the dark.,6
I have spoke already and it is provided;,6
Madam I will.,6
Where is the queen?,6
Exit,6
Madam as thereto sworn by your command,6
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria,6
You with your children will he send before:,6
Your pleasure and my promise.,6
I shall remain your debtor.,6
Adieu good queen; I must attend on Caesar.,6
Exit DOLABELLA,6
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown,6
With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall,6
Rank of gross diet shall be enclouded,6
The gods forbid!,6
Will catch at us like strumpets; and scald rhymers,6
Extemporally will stage us and present,6
Shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see,6
I' the posture of a whore.,6
Nay that's certain.,6
Are stronger than mine eyes.,6
To fool their preparation and to conquer,6
Re-enter CHARMIAN,6
Show me my women like a queen: go fetch,6
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras go.,6
And when thou hast done this chare I'll give thee leave,6
Wherefore's this noise?,6
Enter a Guardsman,6
That will not be denied your highness presence:,6
Let him come in.,6
What poor an instrument,6
My resolution's placed and I have nothing,6
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon,6
Re-enter Guardsman with Clown bringing in a basket,6
Avoid and leave him.,6
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,6
Truly I have him: but I would not be the party,6
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or,6
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?,6
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,6
do but in the way of honesty: how she died of the,6
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will,6
half that they do: but this is most fallible the,6
Get thee hence; farewell.,6
Setting down his basket,6
You must think this look you that the worm will,6
Ay ay; farewell.,6
keeping of wise people; for indeed there is no,6
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.,6
not worth the feeding.,6
You must not think I am so simple but I know the,6
woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her,6
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten,6
Well get thee gone; farewell.,6
Exit,6
Give me my robe put on my crown; I have,6
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:,6
Antony call; I see him rouse himself,6
The luck of Caesar which the gods give men,6
Now to that name my courage prove my title!,6
I give to baser life. So; have you done?,6
Farewell kind Charmian; Iras long farewell.,6
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?,6
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,6
If thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world,6
Dissolve thick cloud and rain; that I may say,6
This proves me base:,6
He'll make demand of her and spend that kiss,6
mortal wretch,6
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate,6
Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,6
Unpolicied!,6
Peace peace!,6
That sucks the nurse asleep?,6
As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle--,6
Applying another asp to her arm,6
Dies,6
Now boast thee death in thy possession lies,6
And golden Phoebus never be beheld,6
I'll mend it and then play.,6
Where is the queen?,6
Caesar hath sent--,6
Applies an asp,6
Approach ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.,6
What work is here! Charmian is this well done?,6
Descended of so many royal kings.,6
Dies,6
How goes it here?,6
Caesar thy thoughts,6
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou,6
Within  'A way there a way for Caesar!',6
O sir you are too sure an augurer;,6
Bravest at the last,6
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?,6
Who was last with them?,6
This was his basket.,6
O Caesar,6
I found her trimming up the diadem,6
And on the sudden dropp'd.,6
If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear,6
As she would catch another Antony,6
Here on her breast,6
The like is on her arm.,6
Have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves,6
Most probable,6
She hath pursued conclusions infinite,6
And bear her women from the monument:,6
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it,6
Strike those that make them; and their story is,6
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall,6
And then to Rome. Come Dolabella see,6
Exeunt,6
SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.,7
Proceed Solinus to procure my fall,7
Merchant of Syracuse plead no more;,7
The enmity and discord which of late,7
To merchants our well-dealing countrymen,7
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,7
For since the mortal and intestine jars,7
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,7
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more,7
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;,7
Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies,7
Unless a thousand marks be levied,7
Thy substance valued at the highest rate,7
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.,7
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.,7
Why thou departed'st from thy native home,7
A heavier task could not have been imposed,7
Yet that the world may witness that my end,7
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.,7
Unto a woman happy but for me,7
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased,7
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,7
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:,7
Before herself almost at fainting under,7
Had made provision for her following me,7
There had she not been long but she became,7
And which was strange the one so like the other,7
That very hour and in the self-same inn,7
Of such a burden male twins both alike:,7
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.,7
Made daily motions for our home return:,7
We came aboard.,7
Before the always wind-obeying deep,7
But longer did we not retain much hope;,7
Did but convey unto our fearful minds,7
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,7
Weeping before for what she saw must come,7
That mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear,7
And this it was for other means was none:,7
And left the ship then sinking-ripe to us:,7
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,7
To him one of the other twins was bound,7
The children thus disposed my wife and I,7
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;,7
Was carried towards Corinth as we thought.,7
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;,7
The seas wax'd calm and we discovered,7
Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this:,7
Gather the sequel by that went before.,7
For we may pity though not pardon thee.,7
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!,7
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;,7
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;,7
Fortune had left to both of us alike,7
Her part poor soul! seeming as burdened,7
Was carried with more speed before the wind;,7
By fishermen of Corinth as we thought.,7
And knowing whom it was their hap to save,7
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,7
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.,7
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,7
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,7
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.,7
At eighteen years became inquisitive,7
That his attendant--so his case was like,7
Might bear him company in the quest of him:,7
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.,7
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,7
Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought,7
But here must end the story of my life;,7
Could all my travels warrant me they live.,7
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!,7
Against my crown my oath my dignity,7
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.,7
And passed sentence may not be recall'd,7
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.,7
To seek thy life by beneficial help:,7
Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum,7
Gaoler take him to thy custody.,7
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,7
Exeunt,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse DROMIO of Syracuse and First Merchant,7
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.,7
Is apprehended for arrival here;,7
According to the statute of the town,7
There is your money that I had to keep.,7
Go bear it to the Centaur where we host,7
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:,7
Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings,7
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.,7
Many a man would take you at your word,7
Exit,7
A trusty villain sir that very oft,7
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.,7
And then go to my inn and dine with me?,7
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;,7
Please you I'll meet with you upon the mart,7
My present business calls me from you now.,7
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself,7
Sir I commend you to your own content.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.,7
That in the ocean seeks another drop,7
Unseen inquisitive confounds himself:,7
In quest of them unhappy lose myself.,7
Here comes the almanac of my true date.,7
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:,7
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;,7
She is so hot because the meat is cold;,7
You come not home because you have no stomach;,7
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Where have you left the money that I gave you?,7
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Tell me and dally not where is the money?,7
So great a charge from thine own custody?,7
I from my mistress come to you in post;,7
For she will score your fault upon my pate.,7
And strike you home without a messenger.,7
Come Dromio come these jests are out of season;,7
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.,7
Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,7
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?,7
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,7
If I should pay your worship those again,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Your worship's wife my mistress at the Phoenix;,7
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.,7
What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,7
What mean you sir? for God's sake hold your hands!,7
Exit,7
Upon my life by some device or other,7
They say this town is full of cozenage,7
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,7
Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks,7
If it prove so I will be gone the sooner.,7
I greatly fear my money is not safe.,7
ACT II,7
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA,7
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!,7
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,7
Good sister let us dine and never fret:,7
Time is their master and when they see time,7
Why should their liberty than ours be more?,7
Look when I serve him so he takes it ill.,7
There's none but asses will be bridled so.,7
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye,7
The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls,7
Men more divine the masters of all these,7
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,7
Are masters to their females and their lords:,7
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.,7
But were you wedded you would bear some sway.,7
How if your husband start some other where?,7
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;,7
A wretched soul bruised with adversity,7
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,7
So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,7
But if thou live to see like right bereft,7
Well I will marry one day but to try.,7
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus,7
Nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears,7
Say didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?,7
Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it.,7
Nay he struck so plainly I could too well feel his,7
understand them.,7
hath great care to please his wife.,7
Horn-mad thou villain!,7
But sure he is stark mad.,7
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:,7
Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:,7
Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain?',7
My mistress sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!,7
Quoth who?,7
I know' quoth he 'no house no wife no mistress.',7
I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders;,7
Go back again thou slave and fetch him home.,7
For God's sake send some other messenger.,7
And he will bless that cross with other beating:,7
Hence prating peasant! fetch thy master home.,7
That like a football you do spurn me thus?,7
If I last in this service you must case me in leather.,7
Fie how impatience loureth in your face!,7
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.,7
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:,7
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,7
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?,7
What ruins are in me that can be found,7
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair,7
But too unruly deer he breaks the pale,7
Self-harming jealousy! fie beat it hence!,7
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,7
Sister you know he promised me a chain;,7
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!,7
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,7
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,7
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,7
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!,7
SCENE II. A public place.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave,7
By computation and mine host's report.,7
I sent him from the mart. See here he comes.,7
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?,7
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?,7
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,7
What answer sir? when spake I such a word?,7
Even now even here not half an hour since.,7
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.,7
Villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt,7
For which I hope thou felt'st I was displeased.,7
What means this jest? I pray you master tell me.,7
Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?,7
Beating him,7
Upon what bargain do you give it me?,7
Because that I familiarly sometimes,7
Your sauciness will jest upon my love,7
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,7
If you will jest with me know my aspect,7
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.,7
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows,7
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nothing sir but that I am beaten.,7
Shall I tell you why?,7
a wherefore.,7
Why first--for flouting me; and then wherefore--,7
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,7
nor reason?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing.,7
I'll make you amends next to give you nothing for,7
No sir; I think the meat wants that I have.,7
In good time sir; what's that?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
If it be sir I pray you eat none of it.,7
Your reason?,7
dry basting.,7
Well sir learn to jest in good time: there's a,7
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.,7
By what rule sir?,7
pate of father Time himself.,7
Let's hear it.,7
grows bald by nature.,7
May he not do it by fine and recovery?,7
lost hair of another man.,7
Why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is,7
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.,7
Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.,7
it in a kind of jollity.,7
For what reason?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Sure ones then.,7
Nay not sure in a thing falsing.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
The one to save the money that he spends in,7
drop in his porridge.,7
You would all this time have proved there is no,7
Marry and did sir; namely no time to recover hair,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
time to recover.,7
to the world's end will have bald followers.,7
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:,7
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA,7
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;,7
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow,7
That never object pleasing in thine eye,7
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,7
How comes it now my husband O how comes it,7
Thyself I call it being strange to me,7
Am better than thy dear self's better part.,7
For know my love as easy mayest thou fall,7
And take unmingled that same drop again,7
As take from me thyself and not me too.,7
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,7
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!,7
And hurl the name of husband in my face,7
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,7
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.,7
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:,7
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,7
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,7
Who every word by all my wit being scann'd,7
Fie brother! how the world is changed with you!,7
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.,7
By Dromio?,7
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,7
Denied my house for his me for his wife.,7
Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman?,7
I sir? I never saw her till this time.,7
Villain thou liest; for even her very words,7
I never spake with her in all my life.,7
How can she thus then call us by our names,7
How ill agrees it with your gravity,7
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!,7
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.,7
Thou art an elm my husband I a vine,7
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:,7
Usurping ivy brier or idle moss;,7
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.,7
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:,7
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?,7
Until I know this sure uncertainty,7
Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner.,7
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!,7
If we obey them not this will ensue,7
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?,7
I am transformed master am I not?,7
I think thou art in mind and so am I.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
No I am an ape.,7
Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.,7
But I should know her as well as she knows me.,7
To put the finger in the eye and weep,7
Come sir to dinner. Dromio keep the gate.,7
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.,7
Say he dines forth and let no creature enter.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?,7
I'll say as they say and persever so,7
Master shall I be porter at the gate?,7
Come come Antipholus we dine too late.,7
ACT III,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus DROMIO of Ephesus ANGELO and BALTHAZAR,7
Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all;,7
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop,7
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.,7
He met me on the mart and that I beat him,7
And that I did deny my wife and house.,7
Say what you will sir but I know what I know;,7
If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry so it doth appear,7
I should kick being kick'd; and being at that pass,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.,7
welcome dear.,7
O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish,7
Good meat sir is common; that every churl affords.,7
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
But though my cates be mean take them in good part;,7
But soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.,7
[Within]  Mome malt-horse capon coxcomb,7
Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch.,7
for such store,7
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in,7
[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came lest he,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  Right sir; I'll tell you when an you tell,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  The porter for this time sir and my name,7
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.,7
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,7
name for an ass.,7
at the gate?,7
[Within]  Faith no; he comes too late;,7
O Lord I must laugh!,7
[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?,7
[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce thou hast,7
Do you hear you minion? you'll let us in I hope?,7
[Within]  I thought to have asked you.,7
So come help: well struck! there was blow for blow.,7
Thou baggage let me in.,7
Master knock the door hard.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  What needs all that and a pair of stocks in the town?,7
this noise?,7
unruly boys.,7
Are you there wife? you might have come before.,7
If you went in pain master this 'knave' would go sore.,7
fain have either.,7
They stand at the door master; bid them welcome hither.,7
There is something in the wind that we cannot get in.,7
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  Break any breaking here and I'll break your,7
A man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind,7
[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon,7
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,7
[Within]  Ay when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.,7
Well I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.,7
For a fish without a fin there's a fowl without a feather;,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Have patience sir; O let it not be so!,7
And draw within the compass of suspect,7
Once this--your long experience of her wisdom,7
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:,7
Why at this time the doors are made against you.,7
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,7
To know the reason of this strange restraint.,7
Now in the stirring passage of the day,7
And that supposed by the common rout,7
That may with foul intrusion enter in,7
For slander lives upon succession,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.,7
Pretty and witty; wild and yet too gentle:,7
My wife--but I protest without desert--,7
To her will we to dinner.,7
Get you home,7
Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine;,7
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--,7
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,7
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.,7
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.,7
SCENE II. The same.,7
And may it be that you have quite forgot,7
Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?,7
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,7
Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth;,7
Let not my sister read it in your eye;,7
Look sweet be fair become disloyalty;,7
Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted;,7
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?,7
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,7
Shame hath a bastard fame well managed;,7
Alas poor women! make us but believe,7
Though others have the arm show us the sleeve;,7
Then gentle brother get you in again;,7
Tis holy sport to be a little vain,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine--,7
Than our earth's wonder more than earth divine.,7
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,7
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.,7
To make it wander in an unknown field?,7
Transform me then and to your power I'll yield.,7
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,7
Far more far more to you do I decline.,7
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:,7
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,7
And in that glorious supposition think,7
Let Love being light be drowned if she sink!,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.,7
For gazing on your beams fair sun being by.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Why call you me love? call my sister so.,7
Thy sister's sister.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
It is thyself mine own self's better part,7
My food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,7
All this my sister is or else should be.,7
Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee.,7
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.,7
O soft air! hold you still:,7
Exit,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Do you know me sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I am an ass I am a woman's man and besides myself.,7
Marry sir besides myself I am due to a woman; one,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry sir such claim as you would lay to your,7
being a beast she would have me; but that she,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
A very reverent body; ay such a one as a man may,7
but lean luck in the match and yet is she a,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry sir she's the kitchen wench and all grease;,7
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I,7
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Swart like my shoe but her face nothing half so,7
shoes in the grime of it.,7
That's a fault that water will mend.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nell sir; but her name and three quarters that's,7
hip to hip.,7
Then she bears some breadth?,7
she is spherical like a globe; I could find out,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.,7
Where Scotland?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
In her forehead; armed and reverted making war,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I looked for the chalky cliffs but I could find no,7
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.,7
Where Spain?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Oh sir upon her nose all o'er embellished with,7
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Oh sir I did not look so low. To conclude this,7
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what,7
shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my,7
And I think if my breast had not been made of,7
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
An if the wind blow any way from shore,7
If any bark put forth come to the mart,7
If every one knows us and we know none,7
As from a bear a man would run for life,7
Exit,7
There's none but witches do inhabit here;,7
She that doth call me husband even my soul,7
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,7
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:,7
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.,7
Master Antipholus--,7
Ay that's my name.,7
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
What please yourself sir: I have made it for you.,7
Made it for me sir! I bespoke it not.,7
Go home with it and please your wife withal;,7
And then receive my money for the chain.,7
I pray you sir receive the money now,7
You are a merry man sir: fare you well.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
But this I think there's no man is so vain,7
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,7
I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay,7
Exit,7
SCENE I. A public place.,7
You know since Pentecost the sum is due,7
Nor now I had not but that I am bound,7
Therefore make present satisfaction,7
Even just the sum that I do owe to you,7
And in the instant that I met with you,7
I shall receive the money for the same.,7
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.,7
That labour may you save: see where he comes.,7
While I go to the goldsmith's house go thou,7
Among my wife and her confederates,7
But soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;,7
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I promised your presence and the chain;,7
Belike you thought our love would last too long,7
Saving your merry humour here's the note,7
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.,7
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:,7
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.,7
I am not furnish'd with the present money;,7
Good signior take the stranger to my house,7
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:,7
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?,7
No; bear it with you lest I come not time enough.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Or else you may return without your money.,7
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.,7
But like a shrew you first begin to brawl.,7
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!,7
Why give it to my wife and fetch your money.,7
Either send the chain or send me by some token.,7
Fie now you run this humour out of breath,7
My business cannot brook this dalliance.,7
If not I'll leave him to the officer.,7
I answer you! what should I answer you?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
You know I gave it you half an hour since.,7
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.,7
Consider how it stands upon my credit.,7
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.,7
Either consent to pay this sum for me,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Arrest me foolish fellow if thou darest.,7
I would not spare my brother in this case,7
I do arrest you sir: you hear the suit.,7
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.,7
As all the metal in your shop will answer.,7
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.,7
Master there is a bark of Epidamnum,7
And then sir she bears away. Our fraughtage sir,7
The oil the balsamum and aqua-vitae.,7
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And told thee to what purpose and what end.,7
You sent me to the bay sir for a bark.,7
I will debate this matter at more leisure,7
To Adriana villain hie thee straight:,7
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,7
Tell her I am arrested in the street,7
On officer to prison till it come.,7
To Adriana! that is where we dined,7
She is too big I hope for me to compass.,7
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.,7
SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.,7
Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so?,7
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?,7
What observation madest thou in this case,7
First he denied you had in him no right.,7
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.,7
Then pleaded I for you.,7
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.,7
With words that in an honest suit might move.,7
Didst speak him fair?,7
I cannot nor I will not hold me still;,7
He is deformed crooked old and sere,7
Vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind;,7
Who would be jealous then of such a one?,7
Ah but I think him better than I say,7
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:,7
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse,7
How hast thou lost thy breath?,7
Where is thy master Dromio? is he well?,7
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;,7
A fiend a fury pitiless and rough;,7
A back-friend a shoulder-clapper one that,7
The passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands;,7
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.,7
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.,7
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;,7
Will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk?,7
Exit Luciana,7
That he unknown to me should be in debt.,7
Not on a band but on a stronger thing;,7
What the chain?,7
It was two ere I left him and now the clock,7
The hours come back! that did I never hear.,7
very fear.,7
Time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he's,7
Nay he's a thief too: have you not heard men say,7
If Time be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way,7
Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse,7
And bring thy master home immediately.,7
Conceit my comfort and my injury.,7
SCENE III. A public place.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;,7
Some tender money to me; some invite me;,7
Some offer me commodities to buy:,7
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,7
Sure these are but imaginary wiles,7
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,7
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?,7
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?,7
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's,7
behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
No? why 'tis a plain case: he that went like a,7
that when gentlemen are tired gives them a sob,7
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up,7
morris-pike.,7
What thou meanest an officer?,7
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that,7
give you good rest!',7
Well sir there rest in your foolery. Is there any,7
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were,7
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And here we wander in illusions:,7
Enter a Courtezan,7
I see sir you have found the goldsmith now:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Master is this Mistress Satan?,7
It is the devil.,7
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof,7
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is,7
light is an effect of fire and fire will burn;,7
Your man and you are marvellous merry sir.,7
Master if you do expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Thou art as you are all a sorceress:,7
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,7
And I'll be gone sir and not trouble you.,7
A rush a hair a drop of blood a pin,7
But she more covetous would have a chain.,7
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.,7
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.,7
Avaunt thou witch! Come Dromio let us go.,7
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse,7
Else would he never so demean himself.,7
And for the same he promised me a chain:,7
The reason that I gather he is mad,7
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,7
Belike his wife acquainted with his fits,7
My way is now to hie home to his house,7
He rush'd into my house and took perforce,7
For forty ducats is too much to lose.,7
SCENE IV. A street.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I'll give thee ere I leave thee so much money,7
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,7
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,7
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end,7
How now sir! have you that I sent you for?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Why sir I gave the money for the rope.,7
Five hundred ducats villain for a rope?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
To a rope's-end sir; and to that end am I returned.,7
And to that end sir I will welcome you.,7
Good sir be patient.,7
Good now hold thy tongue.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I would I were senseless sir that I might not feel,7
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an,7
I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long,7
nativity to this instant and have nothing at his,7
heats me with beating; when I am warm he cools me,7
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with,7
I return; nay I bear it on my shoulders as a,7
lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door.,7
Come go along; my wife is coming yonder.,7
Mistress 'respice finem' respect your end; or,7
rope's-end.',7
Wilt thou still talk?,7
How say you now? is not your husband mad?,7
Good Doctor Pinch you are a conjurer;,7
And I will please you what you will demand.,7
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Striking him,7
To yield possession to my holy prayers,7
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!,7
Peace doting wizard peace! I am not mad.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Did this companion with the saffron face,7
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,7
O husband God doth know you dined at home;,7
Free from these slanders and this open shame!,7
Dined at home! Thou villain what sayest thou?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Perdie your doors were lock'd and you shut out.,7
And did not she herself revile me there?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Certes she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.,7
And did not I in rage depart from thence?,7
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.,7
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Alas I sent you money to redeem you,7
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
He came to me and I deliver'd it.,7
God and the rope-maker bear me witness,7
Mistress both man and master is possess'd;,7
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.,7
Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?,7
I did not gentle husband lock thee forth.,7
But I confess sir that we were lock'd out.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And art confederate with a damned pack,7
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes,7
Enter three or four and offer to bind him. He strives,7
More company! The fiend is strong within him.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them,7
Masters let him go,7
Go bind this man for he is frantic too.,7
What wilt thou do thou peevish officer?,7
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?,7
The debt he owes will be required of me.,7
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,7
Good master doctor see him safe convey'd,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Master I am here entered in bond for you.,7
Out on thee villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?,7
cry 'The devil!',7
Go bear him hence. Sister go you with me.,7
Say now whose suit is he arrested at?,7
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?,7
Say how grows it due?,7
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.,7
Came to my house and took away my ring--,7
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.,7
Come gaoler bring me where the goldsmith is:,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn and DROMIO of Syracuse,7
And come with naked swords.,7
Away! they'll kill us.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
She that would be your wife now ran from you.,7
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:,7
Faith stay here this night; they will surely do us,7
methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for,7
me I could find in my heart to stay here still and,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Therefore away to get our stuff aboard.,7
ACT V,7
Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO,7
But I protest he had the chain of me,7
How is the man esteemed here in the city?,7
Of credit infinite highly beloved,7
His word might bear my wealth at any time.,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse,7
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.,7
Signior Antipholus I wonder much,7
And not without some scandal to yourself,7
This chain which now you wear so openly:,7
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,7
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Yes that you did sir and forswore it too.,7
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?,7
Fie on thee wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty,7
I dare and do defy thee for a villain.,7
Enter ADRIANA LUCIANA the Courtezan and others,7
Some get within him take his sword away:,7
Run master run; for God's sake take a house!,7
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory,7
Be quiet people. Wherefore throng you hither?,7
Let us come in that we may bind him fast,7
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.,7
How long hath this possession held the man?,7
And much different from the man he was;,7
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.,7
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye,7
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,7
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?,7
Namely some love that drew him oft from home.,7
Why so I did.,7
As roughly as my modesty would let me.,7
And in assemblies too.,7
It was the copy of our conference:,7
At board he fed not for my urging it;,7
In company I often glanced it;,7
And thereof came it that the man was mad.,7
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.,7
And therefore comes it that his head is light.,7
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;,7
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?,7
Sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue,7
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,7
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?,7
To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast:,7
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.,7
When he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly.,7
She did betray me to my own reproof.,7
No not a creature enters in my house.,7
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,7
Till I have brought him to his wits again,7
I will attend my husband be his nurse,7
And will have no attorney but myself;,7
Be patient; for I will not let him stir,7
With wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers,7
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,7
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.,7
And ill it doth beseem your holiness,7
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.,7
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.,7
And never rise until my tears and prayers,7
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.,7
Anon I'm sure the duke himself in person,7
The place of death and sorry execution,7
Upon what cause?,7
Who put unluckily into this bay,7
Beheaded publicly for his offence.,7
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.,7
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,7
He shall not die; so much we tender him.,7
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:,7
May it please your grace Antipholus my husband,7
At your important letters--this ill day,7
That desperately he hurried through the street,7
Doing displeasure to the citizens,7
Rings jewels any thing his rage did like.,7
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,7
Anon I wot not by what strong escape,7
And with his mad attendant and himself,7
Met us again and madly bent on us,7
We came again to bind them. Then they fled,7
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,7
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.,7
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.,7
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,7
To do him all the grace and good I could.,7
And bid the lady abbess come to me.,7
Enter a Servant,7
My master and his man are both broke loose,7
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;,7
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:,7
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,7
Between them they will kill the conjurer.,7
And that is false thou dost report to us.,7
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.,7
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.,7
Hark hark! I hear him mistress. fly be gone!,7
Ay me it is my husband! Witness you,7
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus,7
Justice most gracious duke O grant me justice!,7
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took,7
That then I lost for thee now grant me justice.,7
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.,7
Justice sweet prince against that woman there!,7
That hath abused and dishonour'd me,7
Beyond imagination is the wrong,7
Discover how and thou shalt find me just.,7
This day great duke she shut the doors upon me,7
A grievous fault! Say woman didst thou so?,7
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul,7
Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night,7
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,7
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.,7
That goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her,7
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,7
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.,7
I went to seek him: in the street I met him,7
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down,7
Which God he knows I saw not: for the which,7
I did obey and sent my peasant home,7
Then fairly I bespoke the officer,7
By the way we met,7
Of vile confederates. Along with them,7
A mere anatomy a mountebank,7
A needy hollow-eyed sharp-looking wretch,7
Forsooth took on him as a conjurer,7
And with no face as 'twere outfacing me,7
They fell upon me bound me bore me thence,7
There left me and my man both bound together;,7
I gain'd my freedom and immediately,7
To give me ample satisfaction,7
My lord in truth thus far I witness with him,7
But had he such a chain of thee or no?,7
These people saw the chain about his neck.,7
Heard you confess you had the chain of him,7
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;,7
From whence I think you are come by miracle.,7
I never came within these abbey-walls,7
I never saw the chain so help me Heaven!,7
Why what an intricate impeach is this!,7
If here you housed him here he would have been;,7
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here,7
Sir he dined with her there at the Porpentine.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?,7
Why this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.,7
Exit one to Abbess,7
Haply I see a friend will save my life,7
Speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt.,7
And is not that your bondman Dromio?,7
But he I thank him gnaw'd in two my cords:,7
I am sure you both of you remember me.,7
For lately we were bound as you are now,7
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.,7
O grief hath changed me since you saw me last,7
Have written strange defeatures in my face:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Dromio nor thou?,7
I am sure thou dost.,7
man denies you are now bound to believe him.,7
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue,7
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?,7
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,7
Yet hath my night of life some memory,7
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:,7
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.,7
I never saw my father in my life.,7
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps my son,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Can witness with me that it is not so,7
I tell thee Syracusian twenty years,7
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:,7
Re-enter AEMILIA with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse,7
All gather to see them,7
One of these men is Genius to the other;,7
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?,7
I sir am Dromio; pray let me stay.,7
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?,7
Whoever bound him I will loose his bonds,7
Speak old AEgeon if thou be'st the man,7
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:,7
And speak unto the same AEmilia!,7
If thou art she tell me where is that son,7
By men of Epidamnum he and I,7
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth,7
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.,7
I to this fortune that you see me in.,7
These two Antipholuses these two so like,7
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea--,7
Which accidentally are met together.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Stay stand apart; I know not which is which.,7
I came from Corinth my most gracious lord--,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Duke Menaphon your most renowned uncle.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And are not you my husband?,7
No; I say nay to that.,7
And so do I; yet did she call me so:,7
Did call me brother.,7
What I told you then,7
If this be not a dream I see and hear.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I think I did sir; I deny it not.,7
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And Dromio my man did bring them me.,7
And I was ta'en for him and he for me,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains,7
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:,7
That by this sympathized one day's error,7
And we shall make full satisfaction.,7
Of you my sons; and till this present hour,7
The duke my husband and my children both,7
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;,7
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.,7
Master shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?,7
Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Come go with us; we'll look to that anon:,7
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus,7
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:,7
Methinks you are my glass and not my brother:,7
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?,7
That's a question: how shall we try it?,7
Nay then thus:,7
And now let's go hand in hand not one before another.,7
ACT I,8
Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves clubs and other weapons,8
Speak speak.,8
Resolved. resolved.,8
We know't we know't.,8
Is't a verdict?,8
One word good citizens.,8
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they,8
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely;,8
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an,8
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with,8
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge.,8
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.,8
Very well; and could be content to give him good,8
Nay but speak not maliciously.,8
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be,8
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he,8
What he cannot help in his nature you account a,8
If I must not I need not be barren of accusations;,8
Shouts within,8
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!,8
Soft! who comes here?,8
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved,8
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!,8
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak I pray you.,8
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,8
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we,8
Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours,8
We cannot sir we are undone already.,8
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,8
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them,8
The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs,8
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,8
Your knees to them not arms must help. Alack,8
Thither where more attends you and you slander,8
When you curse them as enemies.,8
yet: suffer us to famish and their store-houses,8
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act,8
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain,8
there's all the love they bear us.,8
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,8
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;,8
To stale 't a little more.,8
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but an 't please,8
There was a time when all the body's members,8
That only like a gulf it did remain,8
Still cupboarding the viand never bearing,8
Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel,8
Unto the appetite and affection common,8
Well sir what answer made the belly?,8
Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus--,8
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied,8
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly,8
They are not such as you.,8
The kingly-crowned head the vigilant eye,8
Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter.,8
In this our fabric if that they--,8
Fore me this fellow speaks! What then? what then?,8
Who is the sink o' the body--,8
The former agents if they did complain,8
I will tell you,8
Patience awhile you'll hear the belly's answer.,8
Note me this good friend;,8
Not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd:,8
That I receive the general food at first,8
Because I am the store-house and the shop,8
I send it through the rivers of your blood,8
And through the cranks and offices of man,8
From me receive that natural competency,8
You my good friends'--this says the belly mark me--,8
Though all at once cannot,8
Yet I can make my audit up that all,8
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?,8
The senators of Rome are this good belly,8
Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly,8
No public benefit which you receive,8
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,8
I the great toe! why the great toe?,8
Of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost:,8
Lead'st first to win some vantage.,8
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;,8
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS,8
Thanks. What's the matter you dissentious rogues,8
Make yourselves scabs?,8
He that will give good words to thee will flatter,8
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,8
Where he should find you lions finds you hares;,8
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,8
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,8
Who deserves greatness,8
A sick man's appetite who desires most that,8
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,8
With every minute you do change a mind,8
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,8
You cry against the noble senate who,8
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?,8
The city is well stored.,8
They'll sit by the fire and presume to know,8
Who thrives and who declines; side factions,8
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong,8
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's,8
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,8
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high,8
Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded;,8
Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,8
They are dissolved: hang 'em!,8
That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat,8
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds,8
And a petition granted them a strange one--,8
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps,8
Shouting their emulation.,8
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,8
Sicinius Velutus and I know not--'Sdeath!,8
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time,8
For insurrection's arguing.,8
Go get you home you fragments!,8
Where's Caius Marcius?,8
The news is sir the Volsces are in arms.,8
Our musty superfluity. See our best elders.,8
Marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us;,8
They have a leader,8
I sin in envying his nobility,8
I would wish me only he.,8
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.,8
Only my wars with him: he is a lion,8
Then worthy Marcius,8
It is your former promise.,8
And I am constant. Titus Lartius thou,8
What art thou stiff? stand'st out?,8
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,8
O true-bred!,8
Our greatest friends attend us.,8
To MARCIUS,8
Noble Marcius!,8
Nay let them follow:,8
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,8
Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS,8
He has no equal.,8
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?,8
Being moved he will not spare to gird the gods.,8
The present wars devour him: he is grown,8
Such a nature,8
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder,8
Under Cominius.,8
In whom already he's well graced can not,8
A place below the first: for what miscarries,8
To the utmost of a man and giddy censure,8
Had borne the business!',8
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall,8
Come:,8
Though Marcius earned them not and all his faults,8
In aught he merit not.,8
How the dispatch is made and in what fashion,8
Upon this present action.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators,8
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels,8
Is it not yours?,8
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome,8
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think,8
Reads,8
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;,8
Cominius Marcius your old enemy,8
And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman,8
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:,8
Our army's in the field,8
To answer us.,8
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when,8
in the hatching,8
We shall be shorten'd in our aim which was,8
Should know we were afoot.,8
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:,8
If they set down before 's for the remove,8
They've not prepared for us.,8
I speak from certainties. Nay more,8
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.,8
Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike,8
The gods assist you!,8
Farewell.,8
Farewell.,8
SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.,8
I pray you daughter sing; or express yourself in a,8
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he,8
he would show most love. When yet he was but,8
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when,8
sell him an hour from her beholding I considering,8
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if,8
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel,8
bound with oak. I tell thee daughter I sprang not,8
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a,8
But had he died in the business madam; how then?,8
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess,8
alike and none less dear than thine and my good,8
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.,8
Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.,8
Indeed you shall not.,8
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,8
Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:,8
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow,8
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow,8
His bloody brow! O Jupiter no blood!,8
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,8
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood,8
We are fit to bid her welcome.,8
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!,8
And tread upon his neck.,8
My ladies both good day to you.,8
I am glad to see your ladyship.,8
What are you sewing here? A fine spot in good,8
I thank your ladyship; well good madam.,8
look upon his school-master.,8
very pretty boy. O' my troth I looked upon him o',8
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded,8
again; and after it again; and over and over he,8
fall enraged him or how 'twas he did so set his,8
it!,8
Indeed la 'tis a noble child.,8
Come lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play,8
No good madam; I will not out of doors.,8
She shall she shall.,8
threshold till my lord return from the wars.,8
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.,8
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.,8
Tis not to save labour nor that I want love.,8
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill,8
were sensible as your finger that you might leave,8
No good madam pardon me; indeed I will not forth.,8
excellent news of your husband.,8
Verily I do not jest with you; there came news from,8
Indeed madam?,8
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against,8
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set,8
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,8
Give me excuse good madam; I will obey you in every,8
Let her alone lady: as she is now she will but,8
In troth I think she would. Fare you well then.,8
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.,8
you much mirth.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter with drum and colours MARCIUS TITUS  LARTIUS Captains and Soldiers. To them a Messenger,8
My horse to yours no.,8
Agreed.,8
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.,8
I'll buy him of you.,8
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.,8
Within this mile and half.,8
Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work,8
To help our fielded friends! Come blow thy blast.,8
Tutus Aufidius is he within your walls?,8
That's lesser than a little.,8
Hark! our drums,8
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,8
They'll open of themselves.,8
Hark you. far off!,8
Amongst your cloven army.,8
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders ho!,8
They fear us not but issue forth their city.,8
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,8
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,8
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,8
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing,8
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues,8
Further than seen and one infect another,8
That bear the shapes of men how have you run,8
All hurt behind; backs red and faces pale,8
Or by the fires of heaven I'll leave the foe,8
If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,8
Another alarum. The Volsces fly and MARCIUS follows them to the gates,8
Tis for the followers fortune widens them,8
Enters the gates,8
Nor I.,8
See they have shut him in.,8
Alarum continues,8
What is become of Marcius?,8
Following the fliers at the very heels,8
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,8
O noble fellow!,8
And when it bows stands up. Thou art left Marcius:,8
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier,8
Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and,8
Thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world,8
Re-enter MARCIUS bleeding assaulted by the enemy,8
O'tis Marcius!,8
They fight and all enter the city,8
Enter certain Romans with spoils,8
And I this.,8
Alarum continues still afar off,8
See here these movers that do prize their hours,8
Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would,8
Ere yet the fight be done pack up: down with them!,8
There is the man of my soul's hate Aufidius,8
Convenient numbers to make good the city;,8
To help Cominius.,8
Thy exercise hath been too violent for,8
Sir praise me not;,8
The blood I drop is rather physical,8
I will appear and fight.,8
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms,8
Prosperity be thy page!,8
Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.,8
Exit MARCIUS,8
Call thither all the officers o' the town,8
Exeunt,8
Enter COMINIUS as it were in retire with soldiers,8
we are come off,8
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me sirs,8
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard,8
Lead their successes as we wish our own,8
fronts encountering,8
Enter a Messenger,8
The citizens of Corioli have issued,8
I saw our party to their trenches driven,8
Though thou speak'st truth,8
How long is't since?,8
Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:,8
And bring thy news so late?,8
Held me in chase that I was forced to wheel,8
Half an hour since brought my report.,8
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods,8
Before-time seen him thus.,8
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour,8
From every meaner man.,8
Come I too late?,8
But mantled in your own.,8
In arms as sound as when I woo'd in heart,8
And tapers burn'd to bedward!,8
How is it with Titus Lartius?,8
Condemning some to death and some to exile;,8
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,8
To let him slip at will.,8
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?,8
Let him alone;,8
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--,8
From rascals worse than they.,8
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.,8
If not why cease you till you are so?,8
We have at disadvantage fought and did,8
How lies their battle? know you on which side,8
As I guess Marcius,8
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,8
I do beseech you,8
By the blood we have shed together by the vows,8
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;,8
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,8
Though I could wish,8
And balms applied to you yet dare I never,8
That best can aid your action.,8
That most are willing. If any such be here--,8
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear,8
If any think brave death outweighs bad life,8
Let him alone or so many so minded,8
And follow Marcius.,8
O me alone! make you a sword of me?,8
But is four Volsces? none of you but is,8
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,8
from all: the rest,8
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;,8
Which men are best inclined.,8
Make good this ostentation and you shall,8
Exeunt,8
TITUS LARTIUS having set a guard upon  Corioli going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS enters with Lieutenant other Soldiers and a Scout,8
As I have set them down. If I do send dispatch,8
For a short holding: if we lose the field,8
Fear not our care sir.,8
Our guider come; to the Roman camp conduct us.,8
SCENE VIII. A field of battle.,8
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee,8
We hate alike:,8
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.,8
And the gods doom him after!,8
Holloa me like a hare.,8
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,8
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge,8
Wert thou the Hector,8
Thou shouldst not scape me here.,8
Officious and not valiant you have shamed me,8
Exeunt,8
Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter from one side COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side MARCIUS with his arm in a scarf,8
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it,8
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,8
And gladly quaked hear more; where the,8
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,8
Our Rome hath such a soldier.',8
Having fully dined before.,8
O general,8
Hadst thou beheld--,8
Who has a charter to extol her blood,8
As you have done; that's what I can; induced,8
He that has but effected his good will,8
You shall not be,8
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment,8
To hide your doings; and to silence that,8
Would seem but modest: therefore I beseech you,8
What you have done--before our army hear me.,8
To hear themselves remember'd.,8
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,8
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all,8
We render you the tenth to be ta'en forth,8
Your only choice.,8
But cannot make my heart consent to take,8
And stand upon my common part with those,8
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare,8
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall,8
Made all of false-faced soothing!,8
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!,8
My nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch.--,8
You shout me forth,8
As if I loved my little should be dieted,8
Too modest are you;,8
To us that give you truly: by your patience,8
Like one that means his proper harm in manacles,8
As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius,8
My noble steed known to the camp I give him,8
For what he did before Corioli call him,8
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear,8
Flourish. Trumpets sound and drums,8
I will go wash;,8
Whether I blush or no: howbeit I thank you.,8
To undercrest your good addition,8
So to our tent;,8
To Rome of our success. You Titus Lartius,8
The best with whom we may articulate,8
I shall my lord.,8
Refused most princely gifts am bound to beg,8
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?,8
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:,8
But then Aufidius was with in my view,8
To give my poor host freedom.,8
Were he the butcher of my son he should,8
Marcius his name?,8
I am weary; yea my memory is tired.,8
Go we to our tent:,8
It should be look'd to: come.,8
SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.,8
The town is ta'en!,8
Condition!,8
Being a Volsce be that I am. Condition!,8
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times Marcius,8
And wouldst do so I think should we encounter,8
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,8
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where,8
True sword to sword I'll potch at him some way,8
He's the devil.,8
With only suffering stain by him; for him,8
Being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol,8
Embarquements all of fury shall lift up,8
My hate to Marcius: where I find him were it,8
Against the hospitable canon would I,8
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must,8
Will not you go?,8
Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither,8
I may spur on my journey.,8
Exeunt,8
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.,8
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.,8
Not according to the prayer of the people for they,8
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.,8
The lamb.,8
noble Marcius.,8
He's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb. You two,8
Well sir.,8
have not in abundance?,8
Especially in pride.,8
This is strange now: do you two know how you are,8
right-hand file? do you?,8
Because you talk of pride now--will you not be angry?,8
Why 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of,8
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at,8
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for,8
We do it not alone sir.,8
are many or else your actions would grow wondrous,8
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you,8
and make but an interior survey of your good selves!,8
What then sir?,8
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as,8
Menenius you are known well enough too.,8
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying,8
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like,8
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead,8
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as,8
you give me touch my palate adversely I make a,8
delivered the matter well when I find the ass in,8
though I must be content to bear with those that say,8
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in,8
well enough too? what barm can your bisson,8
known well enough too?,8
You know neither me yourselves nor any thing. You,8
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a,8
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a,8
matter between party and party if you chance to be,8
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all,8
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled,8
cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are,8
Come come you are well understood to be a,8
bencher in the Capitol.,8
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When,8
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not,8
cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack-,8
who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors,8
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to,8
infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly,8
BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside,8
How now my as fair as noble ladies--and the moon,8
your eyes so fast?,8
the love of Juno let's go.,8
Ay worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous,8
Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee. Hoo!,8
Nay'tis true.,8
another his wife another; and I think there's one,8
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for,8
Yes certain there's a letter for you; I saw't.,8
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at,8
Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative,8
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.,8
O he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.,8
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.,8
with the oaken garland.,8
Titus Lartius writes they fought together but,8
And 'twas time for him too I'll warrant him that:,8
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli and the gold,8
Good ladies let's go. Yes yes yes; the senate,8
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this,8
In troth there's wondrous things spoke of him.,8
true purchasing.,8
True! pow wow.,8
Where is he wounded?,8
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming,8
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be,8
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of,8
One i' the neck and two i' the thigh--there's,8
He had before this last expedition twenty-five,8
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.,8
Hark! the trumpets.,8
carries noise and behind him he leaves tears:,8
Which being advanced declines and then men die.,8
Know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight,8
With fame a name to Caius Marcius; these,8
Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus!,8
Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus!,8
Pray now no more.,8
O,8
For my prosperity!,8
Nay my good soldier up;,8
By deed-achieving honour newly named--,8
But O thy wife!,8
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,8
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,8
Now the gods crown thee!,8
To VALERIA,8
I know not where to turn: O welcome home:,8
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep,8
A curse begin at very root on's heart,8
That Rome should dote on: yet by the faith of men,8
at home that will not,8
We call a nettle but a nettle and,8
Ever right.,8
Give way there and go on!,8
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,8
From whom I have received not only greetings,8
I have lived,8
And the buildings of my fancy: only,8
Our Rome will cast upon thee.,8
I had rather be their servant in my way,8
On to the Capitol!,8
All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights,8
Into a rapture lets her baby cry,8
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,8
Are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed,8
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens,8
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames,8
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil,8
As if that whatsoever god who leads him,8
And gave him graceful posture.,8
I warrant him consul.,8
During his power go sleep.,8
From where he should begin and end but will,8
In that there's comfort.,8
The commoners for whom we stand but they,8
With the least cause these his new honours which,8
As he is proud to do't.,8
Were he to stand for consul never would he,8
The napless vesture of humility;,8
To the people beg their stinking breaths.,8
It was his word: O he would miss it rather,8
And the desire of the nobles.,8
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it,8
Tis most like he will.,8
A sure destruction.,8
To him or our authorities. For an end,8
He still hath held them; that to's power he would,8
Dispropertied their freedoms holding them,8
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world,8
Only for bearing burdens and sore blows,8
This as you say suggested,8
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,8
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire,8
Shall darken him for ever.,8
What's the matter?,8
That Marcius shall be consul:,8
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,8
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,8
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:,8
Let's to the Capitol;,8
But hearts for the event.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter two Officers to lay cushions,8
for consulships?,8
Coriolanus will carry it.,8
loves not the common people.,8
flattered the people who ne'er loved them; and there,8
wherefore: so that if they love they know not why,8
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate,8
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets,8
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,8
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater,8
nothing undone that may fully discover him their,8
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he,8
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his,8
having been supple and courteous to the people,8
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so,8
in their hearts that for their tongues to be,8
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a,8
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.,8
are coming.,8
Having determined of the Volsces and,8
As the main point of this our after-meeting,8
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,8
Most reverend and grave elders to desire,8
In our well-found successes to report,8
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom,8
With honours like himself.,8
Leave nothing out for length and make us think,8
Than we to stretch it out.,8
Masters o' the people,8
Your loving motion toward the common body,8
We are convented,8
Inclinable to honour and advance,8
Which the rather,8
A kinder value of the people than,8
That's off that's off;,8
To hear Cominius speak?,8
But yet my caution was more pertinent,8
He loves your people,8
Worthy Cominius speak.,8
Nay keep your place.,8
What you have nobly done.,8
I had rather have my wounds to heal again,8
Sir I hope,8
No sir: yet oft,8
You soothed not therefore hurt not: but,8
I love them as they weigh.,8
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun,8
To hear my nothings monster'd.,8
Masters of the people,8
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see,8
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed Cominius.,8
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held,8
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,8
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,8
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,8
When with his Amazonian chin he drove,8
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view,8
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,8
He proved best man i' the field and for his meed,8
Man-enter'd thus he waxed like a sea,8
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,8
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;,8
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before,8
And fell below his stem: his sword death's stamp,8
He was a thing of blood whose every motion,8
The mortal gate of the city which he painted,8
And with a sudden reinforcement struck,8
When by and by the din of war gan pierce,8
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,8
Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if,8
Both field and city ours he never stood,8
Worthy man!,8
Which we devise him.,8
And look'd upon things precious as they were,8
Than misery itself would give; rewards,8
To spend the time to end it.,8
Let him be call'd for.,8
He doth appear.,8
The senate Coriolanus are well pleased,8
I do owe them still,8
It then remains,8
I do beseech you,8
Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them,8
That I may pass this doing.,8
Must have their voices; neither will they bate,8
Put them not to't:,8
Take to you as your predecessors have,8
It is apart,8
Be taken from the people.,8
To brag unto them thus I did and thus;,8
As if I had received them for the hire,8
Do not stand upon't.,8
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul,8
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!,8
You see how he intends to use the people.,8
As if he did contemn what he requested,8
Come we'll inform them,8
I know they do attend us.,8
SCENE III. The same. The Forum.,8
Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him.,8
We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a,8
his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our,8
he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him,8
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful,8
which we being members should bring ourselves to be,8
And to make us no better thought of a little help,8
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.,8
are some brown some black some auburn some bald,8
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of,8
and their consent of one direct way should be at,8
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would,8
Nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's,8
if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward.,8
To lose itself in a fog where being three parts,8
for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife.,8
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But,8
say if he would incline to the people there was,8
Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility with MENENIUS,8
behavior. We are not to stay all together but to,8
by threes. He's to make his requests by,8
honour in giving him our own voices with our own,8
you shall go by him.,8
Exeunt Citizens,8
The worthiest men have done't?,8
I Pray sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring,8
I got them in my country's service when,8
From the noise of our own drums.',8
You must not speak of that: you must desire them,8
Think upon me! hang 'em!,8
Which our divines lose by 'em.,8
I'll leave you: pray you speak to 'em I pray you,8
Exit,8
And keep their teeth clean.,8
So here comes a brace.,8
You know the cause air of my standing here.,8
Mine own desert.,8
Ay but not mine own desire.,8
No sir'twas never my desire yet to trouble the,8
You must think if we give you any thing we hope to,8
Well then I pray your price o' the consulship?,8
Kindly! Sir I pray let me ha't: I have wounds to,8
good voice sir; what say you?,8
A match sir. There's in all two worthy voices,8
But this is something odd.,8
Exeunt the three Citizens,8
Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your,8
customary gown.,8
have not deserved nobly.,8
You have been a scourge to her enemies you have,8
the common people.,8
not been common in my love. I will sir flatter my,8
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account,8
rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise,8
counterfeitly; that is sir I will counterfeit the,8
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore beseech you,8
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give,8
You have received many wounds for your country.,8
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further.,8
Exeunt,8
Better it is to die better to starve,8
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,8
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:,8
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,8
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,8
To one that would do thus. I am half through;,8
Re-enter three Citizens more,8
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;,8
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six,8
Done many things some less some more your voices:,8
He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest,8
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,8
Amen amen. God save thee noble consul!,8
Worthy voices!,8
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes,8
That in the official marks invested you,8
Is this done?,8
The people do admit you and are summon'd,8
Where? at the senate-house?,8
May I change these garments?,8
That I'll straight do; and knowing myself again,8
I'll keep you company. Will you along?,8
Fare you well.,8
He has it now and by his looks methink,8
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.,8
Re-enter Citizens,8
He has our voices sir.,8
Amen sir: to my poor unworthy notice,8
Certainly,8
No'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.,8
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us,8
Why so he did I am sure.,8
He said he had wounds which he could show,8
And with his hat thus waving it in scorn,8
But by your voices will not so permit me;,8
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:,8
your voices,8
Why either were you ignorant to see't,8
To yield your voices?,8
As you were lesson'd when he had no power,8
He was your enemy ever spake against,8
I' the body of the weal; and now arriving,8
If he should still malignantly remain,8
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said,8
Than what he stood for so his gracious nature,8
Translate his malice towards you into love,8
Thus to have said,8
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd,8
As cause had call'd you up have held him to,8
Which easily endures not article,8
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler,8
Did you perceive,8
When he did need your loves and do you think,8
When he hath power to crush? Why had your bodies,8
Against the rectorship of judgment?,8
Ere now denied the asker? and now again,8
Your sued-for tongues?,8
And will deny him:,8
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.,8
They have chose a consul that will from them take,8
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking,8
Let them assemble,8
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,8
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,8
Thinking upon his services took from you,8
Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion,8
Lay,8
No impediment between but that you must,8
Say you chose him,8
By your own true affections and that your minds,8
Than what you should made you against the grain,8
Ay spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.,8
How long continued and what stock he springs of,8
That Ancus Marcius Numa's daughter's son,8
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,8
And  [Censorinus]  nobly named so,8
Was his great ancestor.,8
That hath beside well in his person wrought,8
To your remembrances: but you have found,8
That he's your fixed enemy and revoke,8
Say you ne'er had done't--,8
And presently when you have drawn your number,8
We will so: almost all,8
Exeunt Citizens,8
This mutiny were better put in hazard,8
If as his nature is he fall in rage,8
The vantage of his anger.,8
We will be there before the stream o' the people;,8
Which we have goaded onward.,8
ACT III,8
Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS all the Gentry COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS and other Senators,8
He had my lord; and that it was which caused,8
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,8
Upon's again.,8
That we shall hardly in our ages see,8
Saw you Aufidius?,8
Against the Volsces for they had so vilely,8
Spoke he of me?,8
How? what?,8
That of all things upon the earth he hated,8
To hopeless restitution so he might,8
At Antium lives he?,8
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,8
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS,8
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;,8
Against all noble sufferance.,8
Ha! what is that?,8
What makes this change?,8
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?,8
Have I had children's voices?,8
The people are incensed against him.,8
Or all will fall in broil.,8
Must these have voices that can yield them now,8
your offices?,8
Have you not set them on?,8
It is a purposed thing and grows by plot,8
Suffer't and live with such as cannot rule,8
Call't not a plot:,8
When corn was given them gratis you repined;,8
Time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness.,8
Not to them all.,8
How! I inform them!,8
Not unlike,8
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,8
Your fellow tribune.,8
For which the people stir: if you will pass,8
Which you are out of with a gentler spirit,8
Nor yoke with him for tribune.,8
The people are abused; set on. This paltering,8
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely,8
Tell me of corn!,8
Not now not now.,8
Now as I live I will. My nobler friends,8
For the mutable rank-scented many let them,8
Therein behold themselves: I say again,8
The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition,8
and scatter'd,8
Who lack not virtue no nor power but that,8
Well no more.,8
How! no more!,8
Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs,8
Which we disdain should tatter us yet sought,8
You speak o' the people,8
A man of their infirmity.,8
We let the people know't.,8
Choler!,8
By Jove 'twould be my mind!,8
That shall remain a poison where it is,8
Shall remain!,8
His absolute 'shall'?,8
Shall'!,8
You grave but reckless senators have you thus,8
That with his peremptory 'shall' being but,8
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,8
Then vail your ignorance; if none awake,8
Be not as common fools; if you are not,8
If they be senators: and they are no less,8
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,8
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench,8
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches,8
Neither supreme how soon confusion,8
The one by the other.,8
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth,8
Sometime in Greece--,8
Though there the people had more absolute power,8
The ruin of the state.,8
One that speaks thus their voice?,8
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn,8
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,8
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service,8
Their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd,8
Which they have often made against the senate,8
Of our so frank donation. Well what then?,8
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express,8
We are the greater poll and in true fear,8
The nature of our seats and make the rabble,8
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in,8
Come enough.,8
No take more:,8
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,8
Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom,8
Of general ignorance--it must omit,8
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,8
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore beseech you--,8
That love the fundamental part of state,8
A noble life before a long and wish,8
That's sure of death without it at once pluck out,8
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour,8
Of that integrity which should become't,8
For the in which doth control't.,8
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer,8
Thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee!,8
On whom depending their obedience fails,8
When what's not meet but what must be was law,8
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,8
Manifest treason!,8
The aediles ho!,8
Let him be apprehended.,8
Exit AEdile,8
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,8
And follow to thine answer.,8
Senators  and C We'll surety him.,8
Hence rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones,8
Help ye citizens!,8
On both sides more respect.,8
Seize him AEdiles!,8
Senators  and C Weapons weapons weapons!,8
Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What ho!',8
Peace peace peace!' 'Stay hold peace!',8
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You tribunes,8
Speak good Sicinius.,8
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak speak speak.,8
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,8
Fie fie fie!,8
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.,8
True,8
By the consent of all we were establish'd,8
You so remain.,8
That is the way to lay the city flat;,8
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges,8
This deserves death.,8
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,8
We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy,8
Therefore lay hold of him;,8
Into destruction cast him.,8
Yield Marcius yield!,8
Beseech you tribunes hear me but a word.,8
[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem truly your,8
And temperately proceed to what you would,8
Sir those cold ways,8
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,8
No I'll die here.,8
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:,8
Down with that sword! Tribunes withdraw awhile.,8
Help Marcius help,8
Down with him down with him!,8
Go get you to your house; be gone away!,8
Get you gone.,8
We have as many friends as enemies.,8
The gods forbid!,8
Leave us to cure this cause.,8
You cannot tent yourself: be gone beseech you.,8
I would they were barbarians--as they are,8
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--,8
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;,8
On fair ground,8
I could myself,8
two tribunes:,8
And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands,8
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend,8
What they are used to bear.,8
I'll try whether my old wit be in request,8
With cloth of any colour.,8
Exeunt CORIOLANUS COMINIUS and others,8
His nature is too noble for the world:,8
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:,8
And being angry does forget that ever,8
A noise within,8
I would they were abed!,8
Could he not speak 'em fair?,8
Where is this viper,8
Be every man himself?,8
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock,8
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial,8
Which he so sets at nought.,8
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,8
He shall sure on't.,8
Peace!,8
With modest warrant.,8
Have holp to make this rescue?,8
As I do know the consul's worthiness,8
Consul! what consul?,8
He consul!,8
If by the tribunes' leave and yours good people,8
The which shall turn you to no further harm,8
Speak briefly then;,8
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence,8
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed,8
Now the good gods forbid,8
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd,8
Should now eat up her own!,8
O he's a limb that has but a disease;,8
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?,8
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath,8
And what is left to lose it by his country,8
A brand to the end o' the world.,8
Merely awry: when he did love his country,8
The service of the foot,8
For what before it was.,8
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence:,8
Spread further.,8
This tiger-footed rage when it shall find,8
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;,8
And sack great Rome with Romans.,8
What do ye talk?,8
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.,8
Since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd,8
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,8
Where he shall answer by a lawful form,8
Noble tribunes,8
Will prove too bloody and the end of it,8
Noble Menenius,8
Masters lay down your weapons.,8
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:,8
In our first way.,8
To the Senators,8
Or what is worst will follow.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians,8
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,8
That the precipitation might down stretch,8
Be thus to them.,8
I muse my mother,8
To call them woollen vassals things created,8
In congregations to yawn be still and wonder,8
To speak of peace or war.,8
I talk of you:,8
False to my nature? Rather say I play,8
O sir sir sir,8
Before you had worn it out.,8
You might have been enough the man you are,8
The thwartings of your dispositions if,8
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.,8
Ay and burn too.,8
Come come you have been too rough something,8
You must return and mend it.,8
Unless by not so doing our good city,8
Pray be counsell'd:,8
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger,8
Well said noble woman?,8
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic,8
Which I can scarcely bear.,8
Return to the tribunes.,8
Repent what you have spoke.,8
Must I then do't to them?,8
Though therein you can never be too noble,8
Honour and policy like unsever'd friends,8
In peace what each of them by the other lose,8
Tush tush!,8
If it be honour in your wars to seem,8
You adopt your policy how is it less or worse,8
With honour as in war since that to both,8
Why force you this?,8
To the people; not by your own instruction,8
But with such words that are but rooted in,8
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.,8
Than to take in a town with gentle words,8
The hazard of much blood.,8
My fortunes and my friends at stake required,8
Your wife your son these senators the nobles;,8
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,8
Of what that want might ruin.,8
Come go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,8
Of what is past.,8
Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;,8
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business,8
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,8
Now humble as the ripest mulberry,8
Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils,8
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,8
Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far,8
This but done,8
For they have pardons being ask'd as free,8
Prithee now,8
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf,8
Enter COMINIUS,8
You make strong party or defend yourself,8
Only fair speech.,8
Can thereto frame his spirit.,8
Prithee now say you will and go about it.,8
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart,8
Yet were there but this single plot to lose,8
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!,8
I shall discharge to the life.,8
I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said,8
To have my praise for this perform a part,8
Well I must do't:,8
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,8
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice,8
Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up,8
Make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees,8
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,8
And by my body's action teach my mind,8
At thy choice then:,8
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let,8
Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death,8
Thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me,8
Pray be content:,8
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,8
Of all the trades in Rome. Look I am going:,8
Or never trust to what my tongue can do,8
Do your will.,8
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself,8
With accusations as I hear more strong,8
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go:,8
Will answer in mine honour.,8
Well mildly be it then. Mildly!,8
SCENE III. The same. The Forum.,8
In this point charge him home that he affects,8
Enforce him with his envy to the people,8
Was ne'er distributed.,8
What will he come?,8
How accompanied?,8
That always favour'd him.,8
Of all the voices that we have procured,8
I have; 'tis ready.,8
I have.,8
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so,8
For death for fine or banishment then let them,8
Insisting on the old prerogative,8
I shall inform them.,8
Let them not cease but with a din confused,8
Of what we chance to sentence.,8
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,8
Go about it.,8
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used,8
Of contradiction: being once chafed he cannot,8
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks,8
Well here he comes.,8
Calmly I do beseech you.,8
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods,8
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!,8
And not our streets with war!,8
A noble wish.,8
Draw near ye people.,8
First hear me speak.,8
Shall I be charged no further than this present?,8
I do demand,8
Allow their officers and are content,8
As shall be proved upon you?,8
Lo citizens he says he is content:,8
Upon the wounds his body bears which show,8
Scratches with briers,8
Consider further,8
You find him like a soldier: do not take,8
But as I say such as become a soldier,8
Well well no more.,8
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,8
You take it off again?,8
Say then: 'tis true I ought so.,8
From Rome all season'd office and to wind,8
For which you are a traitor to the people.,8
Nay temperately; your promise.,8
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!,8
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions in,8
Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free,8
Mark you this people?,8
Peace!,8
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,8
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying,8
So criminal and in such capital kind,8
But since he hath,8
What do you prate of service?,8
You?,8
Know I pray you--,8
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,8
But with a grain a day I would not buy,8
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,8
For that he has,8
Envied against the people seeking means,8
Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence,8
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people,8
Even from this instant banish him our city,8
From off the rock Tarpeian never more,8
I say it shall be so.,8
He's banish'd and it shall be so.,8
He's sentenced; no more hearing.,8
I have been consul and can show for Rome,8
My country's good with a respect more tender,8
My dear wife's estimate her womb's increase,8
Speak that--,8
There's no more to be said but he is banish'd,8
It shall be so.,8
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate,8
As the dead carcasses of unburied men,8
And here remain with your uncertainty!,8
Your enemies with nodding of their plumes,8
To banish your defenders; till at length,8
Making not reservation of yourselves,8
Abated captives to some nation,8
For you the city thus I turn my back:,8
Exeunt CORIOLANUS COMINIUS MENENIUS Senators and Patricians,8
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!,8
Go see him out at gates and follow him,8
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard,8
Come come; let's see him out at gates; come.,8
Exeunt,8
SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.,8
Come leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast,8
Where is your ancient courage? you were used,8
That common chances common men could bear;,8
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,8
A noble cunning: you were used to load me,8
The heart that conn'd them.,8
Nay! prithee woman--,8
And occupations perish!,8
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay mother.,8
If you had been the wife of Hercules,8
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,8
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,8
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,8
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women,8
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother you wot well,8
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,8
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son,8
With cautelous baits and practise.,8
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius,8
More than a wild exposture to each chance,8
O the gods!,8
Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us,8
A cause for thy repeal we shall not send,8
And lose advantage which doth ever cool,8
Fare ye well:,8
Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one,8
Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and,8
Bid me farewell and smile. I pray you come.,8
Hear from me still and never of me aught,8
That's worthily,8
If I could shake off but one seven years,8
I'ld with thee every foot.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter SICINIUS BRUTUS and an AEdile,8
The nobility are vex'd whom we see have sided,8
Now we have shown our power,8
Than when it was a-doing.,8
Say their great enemy is gone and they,8
Dismiss them home.,8
Here comes his mother.,8
Why?,8
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.,8
O ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods,8
Peace peace; be not so loud.,8
Nay and you shall hear some.,8
Will you be gone?,8
To say so to my husband.,8
Ay fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.,8
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome,8
O blessed heavens!,8
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:,8
Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him,8
What then?,8
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.,8
Good man the wounds that he does bear for Rome!,8
I would he had continued to his country,8
The noble knot he made.,8
I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:,8
As I can of those mysteries which heaven,8
Pray let us go.,8
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go hear this:--,8
The meanest house in Rome so far my son--,8
Whom you have banish'd does exceed you all.,8
Why stay we to be baited,8
Take my prayers with you.,8
I would the gods had nothing else to do,8
But once a-day it would unclog my heart,8
You have told them home;,8
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,8
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,8
Fie fie fie!,8
SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.,8
I know you well sir and you know,8
It is so sir: truly I have forgot you.,8
as you are against 'em: know you me yet?,8
The same sir.,8
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the,8
to find you out there: you have well saved me a,8
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the,8
Hath been! is it ended then? Our state thinks not,8
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.,8
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive,8
Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take,8
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing I can,8
breaking out.,8
Banished sir.,8
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it,8
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble,8
great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request,8
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus,8
business and I will merrily accompany you home.,8
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of,8
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,8
and to be on foot at an hour's warning.,8
man I think that shall set them in present action.,8
You take my part from me sir; I have the most cause,8
Well let us go together.,8
SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.,8
A goodly city is this Antium. City,8
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars,8
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones,8
Enter a Citizen,8
And you.,8
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?,8
At his house this night.,8
This here before you.,8
Exit Citizen,8
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,8
Are still together who twin as 'twere in love,8
On a dissension of a doit break out,8
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,8
Some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends,8
My birth-place hate I and my love's upon,8
He does fair justice; if he give me way,8
Exit,8
Music within. Enter a Servingman,8
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.,8
Enter a second Servingman,8
for him. Cotus!,8
Enter CORIOLANUS,8
Appear not like a guest.,8
What would you have friend? whence are you?,8
Exit,8
In being Coriolanus.,8
Whence are you sir? Has the porter his eyes in his,8
Pray get you out.,8
Away! get you away.,8
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.,8
What fellow's this?,8
out of the house: prithee call my master to him.,8
What have you to do here fellow? Pray you avoid,8
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.,8
A gentleman.,8
True so I am.,8
station; here's no place for you; pray you avoid: come.,8
Pushes him away,8
strange guest he has here.,8
Exit,8
Under the canopy.,8
Ay.,8
I' the city of kites and crows.,8
Then thou dwellest with daws too?,8
How sir! do you meddle with my master?,8
mistress. Thou pratest and pratest; serve with thy,8
Beats him away. Exit third Servingman,8
Where is this fellow?,8
disturbing the lords within.,8
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?,8
If Tullus,8
Not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not,8
Commands me name myself.,8
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,8
Say what's thy name?,8
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.,8
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st,8
I know thee not: thy name?,8
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces,8
My surname Coriolanus: the painful service,8
Shed for my thankless country are requited,8
And witness of the malice and displeasure,8
The cruelty and envy of the people,8
Have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest;,8
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity,8
Mistake me not--to save my life for if,8
I would have 'voided thee but in mere spite,8
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast,8
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims,8
thee straight,8
That my revengeful services may prove,8
Against my canker'd country with the spleen,8
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes,8
Longer to live most weary and present,8
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,8
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,8
It be to do thee service.,8
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart,8
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,8
Than thee all noble Marcius. Let me twine,8
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,8
The anvil of my sword and do contest,8
As ever in ambitious strength I did,8
I loved the maid I married; never man,8
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart,8
Bestride my threshold. Why thou Mars! I tell thee,8
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,8
Twelve several times and I have nightly since,8
We have been down together in my sleep,8
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,8
Thou art thence banish'd we would muster all,8
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,8
And take our friendly senators by the hands;,8
Who am prepared against your territories,8
You bless me gods!,8
The leading of thine own revenges take,8
As best thou art experienced since thou know'st,8
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,8
To fright them ere destroy. But come in:,8
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!,8
Yet Marcius that was much. Your hand: most welcome!,8
Here's a strange alteration!,8
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a,8
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his,8
Nay I knew by his face that there was something in,8
cannot tell how to term it.,8
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.,8
man i' the world.,8
Who my master?,8
Worth six on him.,8
greater soldier.,8
for the defence of a town our general is excellent.,8
Re-enter third Servingman,8
What what what? let's partake.,8
lieve be a condemned man.,8
Why here's he that was wont to thwack our general,8
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?,8
good enough for him.,8
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.,8
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched,8
An he had been cannibally given he might have,8
But more of thy news?,8
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no,8
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a,8
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But,8
the middle and but one half of what he was,8
and grant of the whole table. He'll go he says,8
will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled.,8
Do't! he will do't; for look you sir he has as,8
were durst not look you sir show themselves as,8
Directitude! what's that?,8
and the man in blood they will out of their,8
him.,8
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the,8
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they,8
Why then we shall have a stirring world again.,8
tailors and breed ballad-makers.,8
day does night; it's spritely waking audible and,8
mulled deaf sleepy insensible; a getter of more,8
Tis so: and as war in some sort may be said to,8
great maker of cuckolds.,8
Reason; because they then less need one another.,8
as Volscians. They are rising they are rising.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS,8
His remedies are tame i' the present peace,8
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends,8
Though they themselves did suffer by't behold,8
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going,8
We stood to't in good time.,8
Is this Menenius?,8
Hail sir!,8
Your Coriolanus,8
The commonwealth doth stand and so would do,8
All's well; and might have been much better if,8
Where is he hear you?,8
Hear nothing from him.,8
The gods preserve you both!,8
God-den to you all god-den to you all.,8
Are bound to pray for you both.,8
Farewell kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus,8
Now the gods keep you!,8
Exeunt Citizens,8
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,8
Caius Marcius was,8
O'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking,8
And affecting one sole throne,8
I think not so.,8
If he had gone forth consul found it so.,8
Sits safe and still without him.,8
Worthy tribunes,8
Reports the Volsces with two several powers,8
And with the deepest malice of the war,8
Tis Aufidius,8
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;,8
And durst not once peep out.,8
Of Marcius?,8
The Volsces dare break with us.,8
We have record that very well it can,8
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,8
Lest you shall chance to whip your information,8
Of what is to be dreaded.,8
I know this cannot be.,8
Enter a Messenger,8
All to the senate-house: some news is come,8
Tis this slave;--,8
Nothing but his report.,8
The slave's report is seconded; and more,8
What more fearful?,8
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,8
And vows revenge as spacious as between,8
This is most likely!,8
Good Marcius home again.,8
This is unlikely:,8
Than violentest contrariety.,8
You are sent for to the senate:,8
Associated with Aufidius rages,8
O'erborne their way consumed with fire and took,8
Enter COMINIUS,8
What news? what news?,8
To melt the city leads upon your pates,8
What's the news? what's the news?,8
Your franchises whereon you stood confined,8
Pray now your news?,8
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians--,8
He is their god: he leads them like a thing,8
That shapes man better; and they follow him,8
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,8
You have made good work,8
on the voice of occupation and,8
He will shake,8
As Hercules,8
You have made fair work!,8
Ay; and you'll look pale,8
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist,8
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?,8
We are all undone unless,8
Who shall ask it?,8
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf,8
Should say 'Be good to Rome' they charged him even,8
And therein show'd like enemies.,8
If he were putting to my house the brand,8
To say 'Beseech you cease.' You have made fair hands,8
You have brought,8
So incapable of help.,8
How! Was it we? we loved him but like beasts,8
Who did hoot him out o' the city.,8
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,8
As if he were his officer: desperation,8
That Rome can make against them.,8
Here come the clusters.,8
That made the air unwholesome when you cast,8
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;,8
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs,8
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;,8
We have deserved it.,8
For mine own part,8
And so did I.,8
many of us: that we did we did for the best; and,8
it was against our will.,8
You have made,8
O ay what else?,8
Go masters get you home; be not dismay'd:,8
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,8
The gods be good to us! Come masters let's home.,8
him.,8
Exeunt Citizens,8
Nor I.,8
Would buy this for a lie!,8
Exeunt,8
Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant,8
I do not know what witchcraft's in him but,8
Their talk at table and their thanks at end;,8
Even by your own.,8
Unless by using means I lame the foot,8
Even to my person than I thought he would,8
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse,8
Yet I wish sir--,8
Join'd in commission with him; but either,8
To him had left it solely.,8
when he shall come to his account he knows not,8
And so he thinks and is no less apparent,8
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,8
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone,8
Whene'er we come to our account.,8
All places yield to him ere he sits down;,8
The senators and patricians love him too:,8
Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty,8
As is the osprey to the fish who takes it,8
A noble servant to them; but he could not,8
Which out of daily fortune ever taints,8
To fail in the disposing of those chances,8
Not to be other than one thing not moving,8
Even with the same austerity and garb,8
As he hath spices of them all not all,8
So hated and so banish'd: but he has a merit,8
Lie in the interpretation of the time:,8
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair,8
One fire drives out one fire; one nail one nail;,8
Come let's away. When Caius Rome is thine,8
Exeunt,8
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.,8
No I'll not go: you hear what he hath said,8
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:,8
A mile before his tent fall down and knee,8
To hear Cominius speak I'll keep at home.,8
Do you hear?,8
I urged our old acquaintance and the drops,8
He would not answer to: forbad all names;,8
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire,8
Why so: you have made good work!,8
To make coals cheap--a noble memory!,8
When it was less expected: he replied,8
To one whom they had punish'd.,8
Could he say less?,8
For's private friends: his answer to me was,8
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,8
And still to nose the offence.,8
I am one of those; his mother wife his child,8
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt,8
Nay pray be patient: if you refuse your aid,8
Upbraid's with our distress. But sure if you,8
More than the instant army we can make,8
No I'll not meddle.,8
What should I do?,8
For Rome towards Marcius.,8
Return me as Cominius is return'd,8
But as a discontented friend grief-shot,8
Yet your good will,8
As you intended well.,8
I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip,8
He was not taken well; he had not dined:,8
We pout upon the morning are unapt,8
These and these conveyances of our blood,8
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him,8
And then I'll set upon him.,8
And cannot lose your way.,8
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge,8
Exit,8
Not?,8
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury,8
Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me,8
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,8
So that all hope is vain.,8
Who as I hear mean to solicit him,8
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.,8
SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.,8
Enter to them MENENIUS,8
Stand and go back.,8
I am an officer of state and come,8
From whence?,8
You may not pass you must return: our general,8
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before,8
Good my friends,8
And of his friends there it is lots to blanks,8
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name,8
I tell thee fellow,8
The book of his good acts whence men have read,8
For I have ever verified my friends,8
Would without lapsing suffer: nay sometimes,8
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise,8
I must have leave to pass.,8
behalf as you have uttered words in your own you,8
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore go back.,8
always factionary on the party of your general.,8
have I am one that telling true under him must,8
Has he dined canst thou tell? for I would not,8
You are a Roman are you?,8
Then you should hate Rome as he does. Can you,8
defender of them and in a violent popular,8
front his revenges with the easy groans of old,8
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as,8
intended fire your city is ready to flame in with,8
therefore back to Rome and prepare for your,8
you out of reprieve and pardon.,8
use me with estimation.,8
I mean thy general.,8
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back--that's,8
Nay but fellow fellow--,8
What's the matter?,8
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall,8
my son Coriolanus: guess but by my entertainment,8
hanging or of some death more long in,8
presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee.,8
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy,8
thy old father Menenius does! O my son my son!,8
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to,8
thee I have been blown out of your gates with,8
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy,8
here--this who like a block hath denied my,8
Away!,8
Wife mother child I know not. My affairs,8
My revenge properly my remission lies,8
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather,8
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than,8
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,8
And would have rent it. Another word Menenius,8
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!,8
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS,8
Tis a spell you see of much  power: you know the,8
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your,8
What cause do you think I have to swoon?,8
such things as you I can scarce think there's any,8
himself fears it not from another: let your general,8
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,8
Exit,8
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock the,8
Exeunt,8
Enter CORIOLANUS AUFIDIUS and others,8
Set down our host. My partner in this action,8
I have borne this business.,8
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against,8
A private whisper no not with such friends,8
This last old man,8
Loved me above the measure of a father;,8
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,8
The first conditions which they did refuse,8
That thought he could do more a very little,8
Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter,8
Shout within,8
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.,8
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould,8
The grandchild to her blood. But out affection!,8
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.,8
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt and am not,8
As if Olympus to a molehill should,8
Hath an aspect of intercession which,8
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never,8
As if a man were author of himself,8
My lord and husband!,8
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed,8
Like a dull actor now,8
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,8
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O a kiss,8
Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss,8
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,8
Leave unsaluted: sink my knee i' the earth;,8
Of thy deep duty more impression show,8
O stand up blest!,8
I kneel before thee; and unproperly,8
Between the child and parent.,8
What is this?,8
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach,8
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;,8
What cannot be slight work.,8
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?,8
The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle,8
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!,8
Which by the interpretation of full time,8
The god of soldiers,8
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove,8
Like a great sea-mark standing every flaw,8
Your knee sirrah.,8
Even he your wife this lady and myself,8
I beseech you peace:,8
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never,8
Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate,8
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not,8
Your colder reasons.,8
You have said you will not grant us any thing;,8
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;,8
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.,8
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?,8
And state of bodies would bewray what life,8
How more unfortunate than all living women,8
which should,8
with comforts,8
Making the mother wife and child to see,8
His country's bowels out. And to poor we,8
Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort,8
Alas how can we for our country pray.,8
Whereto we are bound? alack or we must lose,8
Our comfort in the country. We must find,8
Our wish which side should win: for either thou,8
With manacles thorough our streets or else,8
And bear the palm for having bravely shed,8
I purpose not to wait on fortune till,8
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts,8
March to assault thy country than to tread--,8
That brought thee to this world.,8
That brought you forth this boy to keep your name,8
A' shall not tread on me;,8
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,8
I have sat too long.,8
Nay go not from us thus.,8
To save the Romans thereby to destroy,8
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit,8
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,8
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest,8
The end of war's uncertain but this certain,8
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,8
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,8
Destroy'd his country and his name remains,8
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,8
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,8
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?,8
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter speak you:,8
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more,8
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate,8
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,8
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,8
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,8
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which,8
Down ladies; let us shame him with our knees.,8
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;,8
And die among our neighbours. Nay behold 's:,8
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,8
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come let us go:,8
His wife is in Corioli and his child,8
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,8
He holds her by the hand silent,8
What have you done? Behold the heavens do ope,8
They laugh at. O my mother mother! O!,8
But for your son--believe it O believe it,8
If not most mortal to him. But let it come.,8
I'll frame convenient peace. Now good Aufidius,8
A mother less? or granted less Aufidius?,8
I dare be sworn you were:,8
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But good sir,8
I'll not to Rome I'll back with you; and pray you,8
[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and,8
At difference in thee: out of that I'll work,8
The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS,8
To VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA  and c,8
A better witness back than words which we,8
Come enter with us. Ladies you deserve,8
In Italy and her confederate arms,8
Exeunt,8
Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS,8
corner-stone?,8
If it be possible for you to displace it with your,8
Rome especially his mother may prevail with him.,8
sentenced and stay upon execution.,8
condition of a man!,8
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown,8
creeping thing.,8
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother,8
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks he,8
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with,8
battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for,8
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity,8
Yes mercy if you report him truly.,8
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy,8
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of,8
The gods be good unto us!,8
us. When we banished him we respected not them;,8
Enter a Messenger,8
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune,8
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,8
Enter a second Messenger,8
Good news good news; the ladies have prevail'd,8
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,8
Friend,8
As certain as I know the sun is fire:,8
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,8
Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together,8
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,8
A shout within,8
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia,8
A city full; of tribunes such as you,8
This morning for ten thousand of your throats,8
Music still with shouts,8
Accept my thankfulness.,8
Great cause to give great thanks.,8
Almost at point to enter.,8
And help the joy.,8
SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.,8
Behold our patroness the life of Rome!,8
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:,8
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;,8
Welcome ladies Welcome!,8
SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.,8
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:,8
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,8
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse,8
Intends to appear before the people hoping,8
Exeunt Attendants,8
Most welcome!,8
Even so,8
And with his charity slain.,8
If you do hold the same intent wherein,8
Of your great danger.,8
We must proceed as we do find the people.,8
Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either,8
I know it;,8
A good construction. I raised him and I pawn'd,8
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,8
He bow'd his nature never known before,8
Sir his stoutness,8
By lack of stooping--,8
Being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth;,8
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way,8
Out of my files his projects to accomplish,8
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame,8
To do myself this wrong: till at the last,8
He waged me with his countenance as if,8
So he did my lord:,8
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd,8
There was it:,8
At a few drops of women's rheum which are,8
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,8
Drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the People,8
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,8
And patient fools,8
With giving him glory.,8
Ere he express himself or move the people,8
Which we will second. When he lies along,8
His reasons with his body.,8
Here come the lords.,8
You are most welcome home.,8
But worthy lords have you with heed perused,8
We have.,8
What faults he made before the last I think,8
Where he was to begin and give away,8
With our own charge making a treaty where,8
He approaches: you shall hear him.,8
Hail lords! I am return'd your soldier,8
Than when I parted hence but still subsisting,8
That prosperously I have attempted and,8
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home,8
The charges of the action. We have made peace,8
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,8
Together with the seal o' the senate what,8
Read it not noble lords;,8
He hath abused your powers.,8
Ay traitor Marcius!,8
Ay Marcius Caius Marcius: dost thou think,8
Coriolanus in Corioli?,8
He has betray'd your business and given up,8
I say 'your city' to his wife and mother;,8
A twist of rotten silk never admitting,8
He whined and roar'd away your victory,8
Look'd wondering each at other.,8
Name not the god thou boy of tears!,8
No more.,8
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!,8
I was forced to scold. Your judgments my grave lords,8
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that,8
To thrust the lie unto him.,8
Cut me to pieces Volsces; men and lads,8
If you have writ your annals true 'tis there,8
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:,8
Why noble lords,8
Which was your shame by this unholy braggart,8
Let him die for't.,8
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin,8
Peace ho! no outrage: peace!,8
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us,8
And trouble not the peace.,8
With six Aufidiuses or more his tribe,8
Insolent villain!,8
The Conspirators draw and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body,8
My noble masters hear me speak.,8
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.,8
Put up your swords.,8
Provoked by him you cannot--the great danger,8
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours,8
Myself your loyal servant or endure,8
Bear from hence his body;,8
As the most noble corse that ever herald,8
His own impatience,8
Let's make the best of it.,8
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.,8
Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully:,8
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,8
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.,8
ACT I,9
Enter two Gentlemen,9
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers,9
But what's the matter?,9
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow,9
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;,9
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king,9
None but the king?,9
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,9
Of the king's look's hath a heart that is not,9
And why so?,9
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--,9
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such,9
For one his like there would be something failing,9
So fair an outward and such stuff within,9
You speak him far.,9
Crush him together rather than unfold,9
What's his name and birth?,9
Was call'd Sicilius who did join his honour,9
But had his titles by Tenantius whom,9
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;,9
Two other sons who in the wars o' the time,9
their father,9
That he quit being and his gentle lady,9
As he was born. The king he takes the babe,9
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,9
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,9
And in's spring became a harvest lived in court--,9
A sample to the youngest to the more mature,9
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,9
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;,9
What kind of man he is.,9
Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,9
His only child.,9
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,9
Were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge,9
How long is this ago?,9
That a king's children should be so convey'd,9
That could not trace them!,9
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,9
I do well believe you.,9
The queen and princess.,9
Enter the QUEEN POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IMOGEN,9
After the slander of most stepmothers,9
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys,9
So soon as I can win the offended king,9
The fire of rage is in him and 'twere good,9
Your wisdom may inform you.,9
I will from hence to-day.,9
I'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying,9
Hath charged you should not speak together.,9
O,9
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,9
Always reserved my holy duty--what,9
And I shall here abide the hourly shot,9
But that there is this jewel in the world,9
My queen! my mistress!,9
To be suspected of more tenderness,9
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:,9
Who to my father was a friend to me,9
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,9
Re-enter QUEEN,9
If the king come I shall incur I know not,9
Aside,9
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,9
Pays dear for my offences.,9
Should we be taking leave,9
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!,9
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,9
This diamond was my mother's: take it heart;,9
When Imogen is dead.,9
You gentle gods give me but this I have,9
With bonds of death!,9
Remain remain thou here,9
As I my poor self did exchange for you,9
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;,9
Upon this fairest prisoner.,9
O the gods!,9
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords,9
Thou basest thing avoid! hence from my sight!,9
With thy unworthiness thou diest: away!,9
The gods protect you!,9
Exit,9
More sharp than this is.,9
That shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st,9
I beseech you sir,9
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare,9
Past grace? obedience?,9
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!,9
And did avoid a puttock.,9
A seat for baseness.,9
A lustre to it.,9
Sir,9
You bred him as my playfellow and he is,9
Almost the sum he pays.,9
Almost sir: heaven restore me! Would I were,9
Our neighbour shepherd's son!,9
Re-enter QUEEN,9
Not after our command. Away with her,9
Beseech your patience. Peace,9
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort,9
Nay let her languish,9
Die of this folly!,9
Fie! you must give way.,9
Here is your servant. How now sir! What news?,9
Ha!,9
There might have been,9
And had no help of anger: they were parted,9
I am very glad on't.,9
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!,9
Myself by with a needle that I might prick,9
On his command: he would not suffer me,9
Of what commands I should be subject to,9
This hath been,9
He will remain so.,9
Pray walk awhile.,9
I pray you speak with me: you shall at least,9
Exeunt,9
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords,9
violence of action hath made you reek as a,9
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.,9
[Aside]  No 'faith; not so much as his patience.,9
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt.,9
backside the town.,9
[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still toward your face.,9
he added to your having; gave you some ground.,9
I would they had not come between us.,9
a fool you were upon the ground.,9
[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election she,9
Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain,9
small reflection of her wit.,9
reflection should hurt her.,9
hurt done!,9
of an ass which is no great hurt.,9
I'll attend your lordship.,9
Well my lord.,9
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.,9
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,9
And not have it 'twere a paper lost,9
That he spake to thee?,9
Then waved his handkerchief?,9
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!,9
No madam; for so long,9
Distinguish him from others he did keep,9
Still waving as the fits and stirs of 's mind,9
How swift his ship.,9
As little as a crow or less ere left,9
Madam so I did.,9
To look upon him till the diminution,9
Nay follow'd him till he had melted from,9
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But good Pisanio,9
Be assured madam,9
I did not take my leave of him but had,9
How I would think on him at certain hours,9
The shes of Italy should not betray,9
At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight,9
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could,9
Betwixt two charming words comes in my father,9
Shakes all our buds from growing.,9
The queen madam,9
Those things I bid you do get them dispatch'd.,9
Madam I shall.,9
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.,9
Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain: he was,9
as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I,9
admiration though the catalogue of his endowments,9
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now,9
I have seen him in France: we had very many there,9
This matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein,9
words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter.,9
Ay and the approbation of those that weep this,9
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,9
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes,9
acquaintance?,9
have been often bound for no less than my life.,9
amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your,9
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,9
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend,9
hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing.,9
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,9
Sir you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I,9
you should have been put together with so mortal a,9
slight and trivial a nature.,9
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in,9
but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say,9
Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords,9
confounded one the other or have fallen both.,9
Safely I think: 'twas a contention in public,9
It was much like an argument that fell out last,9
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time,9
affirmation--his to be more fair virtuous wise,9
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.,9
opinion by this worn out.,9
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.,9
abate her nothing though I profess myself her,9
As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand,9
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others,9
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she,9
precious diamond that is nor you the lady.,9
What do you esteem it at?,9
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's,9
You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given if,9
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,9
Which the gods have given you?,9
You may wear her in title yours: but you know,9
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable,9
casual; a cunning thief or a that way accomplished,9
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier,9
holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do,9
notwithstanding I fear not my ring.,9
Sir with all my heart. This worthy signior I,9
With five times so much conversation I should get,9
to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend.,9
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to,9
something: but I make my wager rather against your,9
offence herein too I durst attempt it against any,9
You are a great deal abused in too bold a,9
worthy of by your attempt.,9
A repulse: though your attempt as you call it,9
Gentlemen enough of this: it came in too suddenly;,9
better acquainted.,9
approbation of what I have spoke!,9
Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.,9
that commend me to the court where your lady is,9
second conference and I will bring from thence,9
I will wage against your gold gold to it: my ring,9
You are afraid and therein the wiser. If you buy,9
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some,9
This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a,9
I am the master of my speeches and would undergo,9
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your,9
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your,9
I will have it no lay.,9
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest,9
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,9
she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are,9
free entertainment.,9
betwixt us. Only thus far you shall answer: if,9
to understand you have prevailed I am no further,9
remain unseduced you not making it appear,9
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with,9
Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set,9
Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and,9
wagers recorded.,9
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO,9
Signior Iachimo will not from it.,9
Exeunt,9
Enter QUEEN Ladies and CORNELIUS,9
Make haste: who has the note of them?,9
Dispatch.,9
Now master doctor have you brought those drugs?,9
Presenting a small box,9
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have,9
Which are the movers of a languishing death;,9
I wonder doctor,9
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how,9
That our great king himself doth woo me oft,9
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet,9
Other conclusions? I will try the forces,9
We count not worth the hanging but none human,9
Allayments to their act and by them gather,9
Your highness,9
Besides the seeing these effects will be,9
O content thee.,9
Aside,9
Will I first work: he's for his master,9
Doctor your service for this time is ended;,9
[Aside]          I do suspect you madam;,9
[To PISANIO]            Hark thee a word.,9
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,9
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has,9
Which first perchance she'll prove on,9
Then afterward up higher: but there is,9
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,9
With a most false effect; and I the truer,9
No further service doctor,9
I humbly take my leave.,9
Weeps she still say'st thou? Dost thou think in time,9
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:,9
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then,9
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name,9
Continue where he is: to shift his being,9
And every day that comes comes to decay,9
To be depender on a thing that leans,9
So much as but to prop him?,9
Thou takest up,9
It is a thing I made which hath the king,9
What is more cordial. Nay I prethee take it;,9
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how,9
Think what a chance thou changest on but think,9
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king,9
As thou'lt desire; and then myself I chiefly,9
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:,9
Exit PISANIO,9
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master,9
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that,9
Of liegers for her sweet and which she after,9
To taste of too.,9
So so: well done well done:,9
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well Pisanio;,9
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies,9
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,9
Exit,9
Enter IMOGEN,9
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,9
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated,9
As my two brothers happy! but most miserable,9
How mean soe'er that have their honest wills,9
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO,9
Comes from my lord with letters.,9
The worthy Leonatus is in safety,9
Presents a letter,9
You're kindly welcome.,9
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,9
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!,9
Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight;,9
[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note to whose,9
him accordingly as you value your trust--,9
So far I read aloud:,9
Is warm'd by the rest and takes it thankfully.,9
Have words to bid you and shall find it so,9
Thanks fairest lady.,9
To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop,9
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones,9
Partition make with spectacles so precious,9
What makes your admiration?,9
Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and,9
For idiots in this case of favour would,9
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed,9
Not so allured to feed.,9
The cloyed will,9
Both fill'd and running ravening first the lamb,9
What dear sir,9
Thanks madam; well.,9
Beseech you sir desire,9
Is strange and peevish.,9
To give him welcome.,9
Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?,9
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.,9
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd,9
When he was here,9
Not knowing why.,9
There is a Frenchman his companion one,9
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces,9
Your lord I mean--laughs from's free lungs cries 'O,9
By history report or his own proof,9
But must be will his free hours languish for,9
Will my lord say so?,9
It is a recreation to be by,9
Some men are much to blame.,9
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might,9
In you which I account his beyond all talents,9
To pity too.,9
Two creatures heartily.,9
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me,9
Lamentable! What,9
I' the dungeon by a snuff?,9
Deliver with more openness your answers,9
That others do--,9
It is an office of the gods to venge it,9
You do seem to know,9
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more,9
Either are past remedies or timely knowing,9
What both you spur and stop.,9
To bathe my lips upon; this hand whose touch,9
To the oath of loyalty; this object which,9
Fixing it only here; should I damn'd then,9
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands,9
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye,9
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit,9
Encounter such revolt.,9
Has forgot Britain.,9
Inclined to this intelligence pronounce,9
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue,9
Let me hear no more.,9
With pity that doth make me sick. A lady,9
Would make the great'st king double--to be partner'd,9
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures,9
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff,9
Or she that bore you was no queen and you,9
Revenged!,9
As I have such a heart that both mine ears,9
How should I be revenged?,9
Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,9
In your despite upon your purse? Revenge it.,9
More noble than that runagate to your bed,9
Still close as sure.,9
Let me my service tender on your lips.,9
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,9
For such an end thou seek'st--as base as strange.,9
From thy report as thou from honour and,9
Thee and the devil alike. What ho Pisanio!,9
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,9
As in a Romish stew and to expound,9
He little cares for and a daughter who,9
O happy Leonatus! I may say,9
Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness,9
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever,9
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.,9
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,9
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch,9
Half all men's hearts are his.,9
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:,9
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,9
To try your taking a false report; which hath,9
In the election of a sir so rare,9
Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you,9
All's well sir: take my power i' the court,9
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot,9
And yet of moment to for it concerns,9
Are partners in the business.,9
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--,9
To buy a present for the emperor,9
In France: 'tis plate of rare device and jewels,9
And I am something curious being strange,9
To take them in protection?,9
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since,9
In my bedchamber.,9
Attended by my men: I will make bold,9
I must aboard to-morrow.,9
Yes I beseech; or I shall short my word,9
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise,9
I thank you for your pains:,9
O I must madam:,9
To greet your lord with writing do't to-night:,9
To the tender of our present.,9
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,9
Exeunt,9
SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.,9
Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the,9
hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes,9
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.,9
your bowl.,9
it would have run all out.,9
any standers-by to curtail his oaths ha?,9
Aside,9
Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?,9
[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.,9
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;,9
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of,9
nobody can match.,9
cock with your comb on.,9
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every,9
No I know that: but it is fit I should commit,9
Ay it is fit for your lordship only.,9
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?,9
[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself and knows it,9
There's an Italian come; and 'tis thought one of,9
Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,9
One of your lordship's pages.,9
derogation in't?,9
Not easily I think.,9
issues being foolish do not derogate.,9
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come go.,9
Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord,9
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that,9
Cannot take two from twenty for his heart,9
Thou divine Imogen what thou endurest,9
A mother hourly coining plots a wooer,9
Of thy dear husband than that horrid act,9
The walls of thy dear honour keep unshaked,9
To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!,9
SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:,9
IMOGEN in bed reading; a Lady attending,9
Please you madam,9
Almost midnight madam.,9
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:,9
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,9
Exit Lady,9
From fairies and the tempters of the night,9
Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk,9
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus,9
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,9
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!,9
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that,9
Bows toward her and would under-peep her lids,9
Under these windows white and azure laced,9
To note the chamber: I will write all down:,9
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,9
Ah but some natural notes about her body,9
Would testify to enrich mine inventory.,9
And be her sense but as a monument,9
Taking off her bracelet,9
Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,9
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast,9
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,9
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en,9
Why should I write this down that's riveted,9
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down,9
To the trunk again and shut the spring of it.,9
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;,9
Clock strikes,9
Goes into the trunk. The scene closes,9
Enter CLOTEN and Lords,9
most coldest that ever turned up ace.,9
But not every man patient after the noble temper of,9
Winning will put any man into courage. If I could,9
It's almost morning is't not?,9
I would this music would come: I am advised to give,9
Enter Musicians,9
fingering so; we'll try with tongue too: if none,9
First a very excellent good-conceited thing;,9
words to it: and then let her consider.,9
Hark hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,9
His steeds to water at those springs,9
And winking Mary-buds begin,9
With every thing that pretty is,9
Arise arise.,9
consider your music the better: if it do not it is,9
calves'-guts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to,9
Exeunt Musicians,9
I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I,9
service I have done fatherly.,9
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.,9
Will she not forth?,9
The exile of her minion is too new;,9
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,9
You are most bound to the king,9
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself,9
With aptness of the season; make denials,9
You were inspired to do those duties which,9
Save when command to your dismission tends,9
Senseless! not so.,9
So like you sir ambassadors from Rome;,9
A worthy fellow,9
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him,9
And towards himself his goodness forespent on us,9
When you have given good morning to your mistress,9
To employ you towards this Roman. Come our queen.,9
If she be up I'll speak with her; if not,9
Knocks,9
I Know her women are about her: what,9
Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea and makes,9
Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold,9
Nay sometime hangs both thief and true man: what,9
One of her women lawyer to me for,9
Knocks,9
Enter a Lady,9
A gentleman.,9
Yes and a gentlewoman's son.,9
Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours,9
Your lady's person: is she ready?,9
To keep her chamber.,9
Sell me your good report.,9
What I shall think is good?--The princess!,9
Good morrow fairest: sister your sweet hand.,9
Good morrow sir. You lay out too much pains,9
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,9
Still I swear I love you.,9
If you swear still your recompense is still,9
This is no answer.,9
I would not speak. I pray you spare me: 'faith,9
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing,9
To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin:,9
Fools are not mad folks.,9
As I am mad I do:,9
That cures us both. I am much sorry sir,9
By being so verbal: and learn now for all,9
By the very truth of it I care not for you,9
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather,9
You sin against,9
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,9
With scraps o' the court it is no contract none:,9
Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,9
But brats and beggary in self-figured knot;,9
The consequence o' the crown and must not soil,9
A hilding for a livery a squire's cloth,9
Profane fellow,9
But what thou art besides thou wert too base,9
Even to the point of envy if 'twere made,9
The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated,9
The south-fog rot him!,9
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,9
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,9
Enter PISANIO,9
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--,9
I am sprited with a fool.,9
Search for a jewel that too casually,9
If I would lose it for a revenue,9
I saw't this morning: confident I am,9
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord,9
Twill not be lost.,9
Exit PISANIO,9
His meanest garment!',9
If you will make't an action call witness to't.,9
Your mother too:,9
But the worst of me. So I leave you sir,9
Exit,9
His meanest garment!' Well.,9
CYMBELINE,9
Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO,9
To win the king as I am bold her honour,9
What means do you make to him?,9
Quake in the present winter's state and wish,9
I barely gratify your love; they failing,9
Your very goodness and your company,9
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius,9
He'll grant the tribute send the arrearages,9
Is yet fresh in their grief.,9
Statist though I am none nor like to be,9
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed,9
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen,9
Smiled at their lack of skill but found,9
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,9
To their approvers they are people such,9
Enter IACHIMO,9
The swiftest harts have posted you by land;,9
To make your vessel nimble.,9
I hope the briefness of your answer made,9
Your lady,9
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty,9
And be false with them.,9
Their tenor good I trust.,9
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court,9
He was expected then,9
All is well yet.,9
Too dull for your good wearing?,9
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.,9
A second night of such sweet shortness which,9
The stone's too hard to come by.,9
Your lady being so easy.,9
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we,9
Good sir we must,9
The knowledge of your mistress home I grant,9
Profess myself the winner of her honour,9
Of her or you having proceeded but,9
If you can make't apparent,9
And ring is yours; if not the foul opinion,9
Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both,9
Sir my circumstances,9
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength,9
You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find,9
Proceed.,9
Where I confess I slept not but profess,9
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story,9
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks or for,9
So bravely done so rich that it did strive,9
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,9
This is true;,9
Or by some other.,9
Must justify my knowledge.,9
Or do your honour injury.,9
Is south the chamber and the chimney-piece,9
So likely to report themselves: the cutter,9
Motion and breath left out.,9
Which you might from relation likewise reap,9
The roof o' the chamber,9
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids,9
Depending on their brands.,9
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise,9
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves,9
Then if you can,9
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!,9
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.,9
Once more let me behold it: is it that,9
Sir--I thank her--that:,9
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,9
She prized it once.,9
To send it me.,9
O no no no! 'tis true. Here take this too;,9
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,9
Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love,9
Of no more bondage be to where they are made,9
O above measure false!,9
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:,9
Who knows if one of her women being corrupted,9
Very true;,9
Render to me some corporal sign about her,9
By Jupiter I had it from her arm.,9
Tis true:--nay keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure,9
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!,9
The cognizance of her incontinency,9
thus dearly.,9
Divide themselves between you!,9
This is not strong enough to be believed,9
Never talk on't;,9
If you seek,9
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole right proud,9
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger,9
This stain upon her?,9
Another stain as big as hell can hold,9
Will you hear more?,9
Once and a million!,9
No swearing.,9
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny,9
I'll deny nothing.,9
I will go there and do't i' the court before,9
Exit,9
The government of patience! You have won:,9
He hath against himself.,9
Exeunt,9
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,9
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;,9
Did call my father was I know not where,9
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd,9
The nonpareil of this. O vengeance vengeance!,9
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with,9
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her,9
This yellow Iachimo in an hour--wast not?--,9
Like a full-acorn'd boar a German one,9
But what he look'd for should oppose and she,9
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion,9
It is the woman's part: be it lying note it,9
Lust and rank thoughts hers hers; revenges hers;,9
Nice longing slanders mutability,9
Why hers in part or all; but rather all;,9
They are not constant but are changing still,9
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,9
In a true hate to pray they have their will:,9
Exit,9
SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.,9
Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us?,9
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues,9
And conquer'd it Cassibelan thine uncle--,9
Than in his feats deserving it--for him,9
Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately,9
And to kill the marvel,9
There be many Caesars,9
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay,9
That opportunity,9
We have again. Remember sir my liege,9
The natural bravery of your isle which stands,9
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,9
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest,9
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--,9
From off our coast twice beaten; and his shipping--,9
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges crack'd,9
The famed Cassibelan who was once at point--,9
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright,9
Come there's no more tribute to be paid: our,9
as I said there is no moe such Caesars: other of,9
straight arms none.,9
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as,9
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If,9
put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute,9
You must know,9
This tribute from us we were free:,9
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch,9
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off,9
Ourselves to be.,9
Say then to Caesar,9
Ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of Caesar,9
Shall by the power we hold be our good deed,9
Who was the first of Britain which did put,9
Himself a king.,9
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--,9
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:,9
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look,9
I thank thee for myself.,9
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent,9
Which he to seek of me again perforce,9
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for,9
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:,9
Let proof speak.,9
pastime with us a day or two or longer: if,9
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you,9
the adventure our crows shall fare the better,9
So sir.,9
All the remain is 'Welcome!',9
SCENE II. Another room in the palace.,9
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not,9
O master! what a strange infection,9
As poisonous-tongued as handed hath prevail'd,9
She's punish'd for her truth and undergoes,9
As would take in some virtue. O my master!,9
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?,9
Have made to thy command? I her? her blood?,9
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,9
so much as this fact comes to?,9
Do't: the letter,9
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!,9
Art thou a feodary for this act and look'st,9
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.,9
How now Pisanio!,9
Who? thy lord? that is my lord Leonatus!,9
That knew the stars as I his characters;,9
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,9
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:,9
For it doth physic love: of his content,9
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers,9
Though forfeiters you cast in prison yet,9
Reads,9
in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as,9
with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,9
this advise you follow. So he wishes you all,9
increasing in love,9
O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou Pisanio?,9
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs,9
Glide thither in a day? Then true Pisanio--,9
let me bate-but not like me--yet long'st,9
For mine's beyond beyond--say and speak thick;,9
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is,9
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as,9
How we may steal from hence and for the gap,9
And our return to excuse: but first how get hence:,9
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,9
Twixt hour and hour?,9
Madam 's enough for you:,9
and too much too.,9
Could never go so slow: I have heard of,9
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands,9
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say,9
A riding-suit no costlier than would fit,9
Madam you're best consider.,9
Nor what ensues but have a fog in them,9
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,9
Exeunt,9
Enter from the cave BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS following,9
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop boys; this gate,9
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs,9
And keep their impious turbans on without,9
We house i' the rock yet use thee not so hardly,9
Hail heaven!,9
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;,9
When you above perceive me like a crow,9
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you,9
This service is not service so being done,9
Draws us a profit from all things we see;,9
The sharded beetle in a safer hold,9
Is nobler than attending for a cheque,9
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:,9
Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.,9
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest nor know not,9
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you,9
With your stiff age: but unto us it is,9
A prison for a debtor that not dares,9
What should we speak of,9
The rain and wind beat dark December how,9
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;,9
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;,9
We make a quire as doth the prison'd bird,9
How you speak!,9
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court,9
Is certain falling or so slippery that,9
A pain that only seems to seek out danger,9
the search,9
As record of fair act; nay many times,9
Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys this story,9
With Roman swords and my report was once,9
And when a soldier was the theme my name,9
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,9
Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves,9
Uncertain favour!,9
But that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd,9
I was confederate with the Romans: so,9
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;,9
More pious debts to heaven than in all,9
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes,9
To him the other two shall minister;,9
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.,9
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!,9
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.,9
up thus meanly,9
The roofs of palaces and nature prompts them,9
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,9
The king his father call'd Guiderius--Jove!,9
The warlike feats I have done his spirits fly out,9
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then,9
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture,9
Once Arviragus in as like a figure,9
His own conceiving.--Hark the game is roused!,9
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,9
Thinking to bar thee of succession as,9
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for,9
And every day do honour to her grave:,9
They take for natural father. The game is up.,9
SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.,9
Thou told'st me when we came from horse the place,9
To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! man!,9
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh,9
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd,9
Into a havior of less fear ere wildness,9
Why tender'st thou that paper to me with,9
Smile to't before; if winterly thou need'st,9
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,9
May take off some extremity which to read,9
Please you read;,9
The most disdain'd of fortune.,9
strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie,9
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain,9
must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with,9
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at,9
where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain,9
equally to me disloyal.',9
Hath cut her throat already. No 'tis slander,9
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath,9
All corners of the world: kings queens and states,9
This viperous slander enters. What cheer madam?,9
To lie in watch there and to think on him?,9
charge nature,9
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed is it?,9
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,9
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks,9
Whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him:,9
And for I am richer than to hang by the walls,9
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,9
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,9
Good madam hear me.,9
Were in his time thought false and Sinon's weeping,9
From most true wretchedness: so thou Posthumus,9
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured,9
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,9
I draw the sword myself: take it and hit,9
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;,9
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike,9
But now thou seem'st a coward.,9
Thou shalt not damn my hand.,9
And if I do not by thy hand thou art,9
There is a prohibition so divine,9
Something's afore't. Soft soft! we'll no defence;,9
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,9
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more,9
Believe false teachers: though those that,9
Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor,9
And thou Posthumus thou that didst set up,9
And make me put into contempt the suits,9
It is no act of common passage but,9
To think when thou shalt be disedged by her,9
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee dispatch:,9
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,9
O gracious lady,9
I have not slept one wink.,9
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.,9
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused,9
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?,9
For my being absent? whereunto I never,9
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,9
But to win time,9
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,9
Talk thy tongue weary; speak,9
Therein false struck can take no greater wound,9
Then madam,9
Most like;,9
Not so neither:,9
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be,9
Some villain ay and singular in his art.,9
Some Roman courtezan.,9
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him,9
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,9
Why good fellow,9
Or in my life what comfort when I am,9
If you'll back to the court--,9
With that harsh noble simple nothing,9
As fearful as a siege.,9
Then not in Britain must you bide.,9
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day night,9
Our Britain seems as of it but not in 't;,9
There's livers out of Britain.,9
You think of other place. The ambassador,9
To-morrow: now if you could wear a mind,9
That which to appear itself must not yet be,9
Pretty and full of view; yea haply near,9
That though his actions were not visible yet,9
As truly as he moves.,9
Though peril to my modesty not death on't,9
Well then here's the point:,9
Command into obedience: fear and niceness--,9
Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:,9
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay you must,9
Exposing it--but O the harder heart!,9
Of common-kissing Titan and forget,9
You made great Juno angry.,9
I see into thy end and am almost,9
First make yourself but like one.,9
Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet hat hose all,9
And with what imitation you can borrow,9
Present yourself desire his service tell him,9
If that his head have ear in music--doubtless,9
And doubling that most holy. Your means abroad,9
Beginning nor supplyment.,9
The gods will diet me with. Prithee away:,9
All that good time will give us: this attempt,9
A prince's courage. Away I prithee.,9
Lest being miss'd I be suspected of,9
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:,9
Or stomach-qualm'd at land a dram of this,9
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods,9
Amen: I thank thee.,9
SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.,9
Thus far; and so farewell.,9
My emperor hath wrote I must from hence;,9
My master's enemy.,9
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself,9
Appear unkinglike.,9
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.,9
And you!,9
The due of honour in no point omit.,9
Your hand my lord.,9
I wear it as your enemy.,9
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.,9
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!,9
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us,9
Tis all the better;,9
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor,9
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:,9
Will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves,9
Tis not sleepy business;,9
Our expectation that it would be thus,9
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd,9
The duty of the day: she looks us like,9
We have noted it. Call her before us; for,9
Exit an Attendant,9
Since the exile of Posthumus most retired,9
Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,9
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,9
Re-enter Attendant,9
Can her contempt be answer'd?,9
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer,9
My lord when last I went to visit her,9
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,9
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this,9
Made me to blame in memory.,9
Not seen of late? Grant heavens that which I fear,9
Exit,9
That man of hers Pisanio her old servant,9
Go look after.,9
Pisanio thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!,9
Proceed by swallowing that for he believes,9
Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her,9
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is,9
Can make good use of either: she being down,9
Re-enter CLOTEN,9
Tis certain she is fled.,9
Dare come about him.,9
This night forestall him of the coming day!,9
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,9
Than lady ladies woman; from every one,9
Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but,9
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment,9
I will conclude to hate her nay indeed,9
Enter PISANIO,9
Come hither: ah you precious pander! Villain,9
Thou art straightway with the fiends.,9
Where is thy lady? Or by Jupiter--,9
I'll have this secret from thy heart or rip,9
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot,9
Alas my lord,9
He is in Rome.,9
No further halting: satisfy me home,9
O my all-worthy lord!,9
Discover where thy mistress is at once,9
Speak or thy silence on the instant is,9
Then sir,9
Touching her flight.,9
Let's see't. I will pursue her,9
[Aside]                 Or this or perish.,9
May prove his travel not her danger.,9
[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,9
Sirrah is this letter true?,9
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah if thou,9
undergo those employments wherein I should have,9
what villany soe'er I bid thee do to perform it,9
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy,9
Well my good lord.,9
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of,9
course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of,9
Sir I will.,9
late master's garments in thy possession?,9
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.,9
hither: let it be thy lint service; go.,9
Exit,9
thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there thou,9
garments were come. She said upon a time--the,9
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect,9
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my,9
eyes; there shall she see my valour which will then,9
speech of insultment ended on his dead body and,9
her I will execute in the clothes that she so,9
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,9
Re-enter PISANIO with the clothes,9
Ay my noble lord.,9
She can scarce be there yet.,9
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,9
but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself,9
wings to follow it! Come and be true.,9
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee,9
To him that is most true. To Milford go,9
You heavenly blessings on her! This fool's speed,9
Exit,9
Enter IMOGEN in boy's clothes,9
I have tired myself and for two nights together,9
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,9
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think,9
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me,9
That have afflictions on them knowing 'tis,9
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness,9
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!,9
My hunger's gone; but even before I was,9
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:,9
yet famine,9
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever,9
If any thing that's civil speak; if savage,9
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy,9
Such a foe good heavens!,9
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I,9
The sweat of industry would dry and die,9
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness,9
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,9
I am thoroughly weary.,9
There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,9
[Looking into the cave],9
But that it eats our victuals I should think,9
What's the matter sir?,9
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness,9
Re-enter IMOGEN,9
Before I enter'd here I call'd; and thought,9
good troth,9
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:,9
As I had made my meal and parted,9
Money youth?,9
As 'tis no better reckon'd but of those,9
I see you're angry:,9
Have died had I not made it.,9
To Milford-Haven.,9
Fidele sir. I have a kinsman who,9
To whom being going almost spent with hunger,9
Prithee fair youth,9
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!,9
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.,9
Were you a woman youth,9
I bid for you as I'd buy.,9
He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:,9
After long absence such is yours: most welcome!,9
Mongst friends,9
Aside,9
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize,9
To thee Posthumus.,9
Would I could free't!,9
What pain it cost what danger. God's!,9
Whispering,9
That had a court no bigger than this cave,9
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by,9
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me gods!,9
Since Leonatus's false.,9
Boys we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth come in:,9
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,9
Pray draw near.,9
less welcome.,9
I pray draw near.,9
SCENE VII. Rome. A public place.,9
This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:,9
Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,9
Full weak to undertake our wars against,9
The gentry to this business. He creates,9
For this immediate levy he commends,9
Is Lucius general of the forces?,9
Remaining now in Gallia?,9
Which I have spoke of whereunto your levy,9
Will tie you to the numbers and the time,9
We will discharge our duty.,9
ACT IV,9
Enter CLOTEN,9
Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments,9
him that made the tailor not be fit too? the,9
a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must,9
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer,9
as well drawn as his; no less young more strong,9
advantage of the time above him in birth alike,9
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant,9
Posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy,9
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before,9
father; who may haply be a little angry for my so,9
testiness shall turn all into my commendations. My,9
purpose! Fortune put them into my hand! This is,9
the fellow dares not deceive me.,9
SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.,9
[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;,9
[To IMOGEN] Brother stay here,9
So man and man should be;,9
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.,9
So sick I am not yet I am not well;,9
To seem to die ere sick: so please you leave me;,9
Is breach of all. I am ill but your being by me,9
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,9
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,9
I love thee; I have spoke it,9
As I do love my father.,9
If it be sin to say so I yoke me,9
I love this youth; and I have heard you say,9
And a demand who is't shall die I'd say,9
[Aside] O noble strain!,9
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:,9
I'm not their father; yet who this should be,9
Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.,9
I wish ye sport.,9
[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods what lies,9
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:,9
The imperious seas breed monsters for the dish,9
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,9
Swallows some,9
He said he was gentle but unfortunate;,9
Thus did he answer me: yet said hereafter,9
To the field to the field!,9
We'll not be long away.,9
For you must be our housewife.,9
I am bound to you.,9
Exit IMOGEN to the cave,9
Good ancestors.,9
But his neat cookery! he cut our roots,9
And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick,9
Nobly he yokes,9
Was that it was for not being such a smile;,9
From so divine a temple to commix,9
I do note,9
Mingle their spurs together.,9
And let the stinking elder grief untwine,9
It is great morning. Come away!--,9
Enter CLOTEN,9
Hath mock'd me. I am faint.,9
Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis,9
I saw him not these many years and yet,9
He is but one: you and my brother search,9
Let me alone with him.,9
Soft! What are you,9
I have heard of such. What slave art thou?,9
More slavish did I ne'er than answering,9
Thou art a robber,9
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I,9
Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not,9
Why I should yield to thee?,9
Know'st me not by my clothes?,9
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,9
Thou precious varlet,9
Hence then and thank,9
I am loath to beat thee.,9
Hear but my name and tremble.,9
Cloten thou villain.,9
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad or,9
Twould move me sooner.,9
Nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know,9
I am sorry for 't; not seeming,9
Art not afeard?,9
At fools I laugh not fear them.,9
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,9
And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:,9
Exeunt fighting,9
No companies abroad?,9
I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,9
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,9
Twas very Cloten.,9
I wish my brother make good time with him,9
Being scarce made up,9
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment,9
Re-enter GUIDERIUS with CLOTEN'S head,9
There was no money in't: not Hercules,9
Yet I not doing this the fool had borne,9
What hast thou done?,9
Son to the queen after his own report;,9
With his own single hand he'ld take us in,9
And set them on Lud's-town.,9
Why worthy father what have we to lose,9
Protects not us: then why should we be tender,9
Play judge and executioner all himself,9
Discover you abroad?,9
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason,9
Was nothing but mutation ay and that,9
Absolute madness could so far have raved,9
It may be heard at court that such as we,9
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--,9
He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable,9
Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,9
More perilous than the head.,9
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,9
I had no mind,9
Did make my way long forth.,9
Which he did wave against my throat I have ta'en,9
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,9
That's all I reck.,9
I fear 'twill be revenged:,9
Becomes thee well enough.,9
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,9
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,9
And put us to our answer.,9
We'll hunt no more to-day nor seek for danger,9
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay,9
To dinner presently.,9
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour,9
And praise myself for charity.,9
O thou goddess,9
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle,9
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,9
That by the top doth take the mountain pine,9
That an invisible instinct should frame them,9
Civility not seen from other valour,9
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange,9
Or what his death will bring us.,9
Where's my brother?,9
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage,9
Solemn music,9
Hark Polydore it sounds! But what occasion,9
Is he at home?,9
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother,9
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?,9
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.,9
Look here he comes,9
Of what we blame him for.,9
The bird is dead,9
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,9
Than have seen this.,9
My brother wears thee not the one half so well,9
O melancholy!,9
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare,9
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,9
How found you him?,9
Thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber,9
right cheek,9
Where?,9
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept and put,9
Answer'd my steps too loud.,9
If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed;,9
And worms will not come to thee.,9
Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele,9
The flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor,9
The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander,9
With charitable bill--O bill sore-shaming,9
Without a monument!--bring thee all this;,9
To winter-ground thy corse.,9
And do not play in wench-like words with that,9
And not protract with admiration what,9
Say where shall's lay him?,9
Be't so:,9
Have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground,9
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.,9
I cannot sing: I'll weep and word it with thee;,9
Than priests and fanes that lie.,9
Great griefs I see medicine the less; for Cloten,9
And though he came our enemy remember,9
mighty rotting,9
That angel of the world doth make distinction,9
And though you took his life as being our foe,9
Pray You fetch him hither.,9
When neither are alive.,9
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother begin.,9
Nay Cadwal we must lay his head to the east;,9
Tis true.,9
So. Begin.,9
Fear no more the heat o' the sun,9
Thou thy worldly task hast done,9
Golden lads and girls all must,9
Fear no more the frown o' the great;,9
Care no more to clothe and eat;,9
The sceptre learning physic must,9
Fear no more the lightning flash,9
Fear not slander censure rash;,9
All lovers young all lovers must,9
No exorciser harm thee!,9
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!,9
Quiet consummation have;,9
Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN,9
Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight more:,9
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.,9
These herblets shall which we upon you strew.,9
The ground that gave them first has them again:,9
Exeunt BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
the way?--,9
Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--,9
But soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!,9
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;,9
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,9
Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing,9
Are sometimes like our judgments blind. Good faith,9
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity,9
The dream's here still: even when I wake it is,9
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!,9
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;,9
Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,9
And mine to boot be darted on thee! Thou,9
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read,9
Hath with his forged letters--damn'd Pisanio--,9
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,9
where's that?,9
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?,9
Have laid this woe here. O 'tis pregnant pregnant!,9
And cordial to me have I not found it,9
This is Pisanio's deed and Cloten's: O!,9
That we the horrider may seem to those,9
Falls on the body,9
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,9
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:,9
But what from Rome?,9
And gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits,9
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,9
When expect you them?,9
This forwardness,9
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now sir,9
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--,9
I saw Jove's bird the Roman eagle wing'd,9
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--,9
Success to the Roman host.,9
And never false. Soft ho! what trunk is here,9
It was a worthy building. How! a page!,9
For nature doth abhor to make his bed,9
Let's see the boy's face.,9
He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,9
They crave to be demanded. Who is this,9
That otherwise than noble nature did,9
In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?,9
I am nothing: or if not,9
A very valiant Briton and a good,9
There is no more such masters: I may wander,9
Try many all good serve truly never,9
Lack good youth!,9
Thy master in bleeding: say his name good friend.,9
Aside,9
No harm by it though the gods hear I hope,9
Thy name?,9
Thou dost approve thyself the very same:,9
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say,9
No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,9
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.,9
I'll hide my master from the flies as deep,9
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,9
Such as I can twice o'er I'll weep and sigh;,9
So please you entertain me.,9
And rather father thee than master thee.,9
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us,9
And make him with our pikes and partisans,9
By thee to us and he shall be interr'd,9
Some falls are means the happier to arise.,9
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.,9
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.,9
A fever with the absence of her son,9
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,9
Upon a desperate bed and in a time,9
So needful for this present: it strikes me past,9
Who needs must know of her departure and,9
By a sharp torture.,9
I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,9
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,9
Good my liege,9
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform,9
There wants no diligence in seeking him,9
The time is troublesome.,9
We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy,9
So please your majesty,9
Are landed on your coast with a supply,9
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!,9
Good my liege,9
Than what you hear of: come more for more,9
The want is but to put those powers in motion,9
I thank you. Let's withdraw;,9
What can from Italy annoy us; but,9
Exeunt all but PISANIO,9
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:,9
To yield me often tidings: neither know I,9
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.,9
These present wars shall find I love my country,9
All other doubts by time let them be clear'd:,9
Exit,9
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.,9
Let us from it.,9
From action and adventure?,9
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans,9
For barbarous and unnatural revolts,9
Sons,9
To the king's party there's no going: newness,9
Among the bands--may drive us to a render,9
Which we have done whose answer would be death,9
This is sir a doubt,9
Nor satisfying us.,9
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,9
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,9
To know from whence we are.,9
Of many in the army: many years,9
From my remembrance. And besides the king,9
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,9
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,9
The shrinking slaves of winter.,9
Better to cease to be. Pray sir to the army:,9
So out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown,9
By this sun that shines,9
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,9
Never bestrid a horse save one that had,9
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed,9
The benefit of his blest beams remaining,9
By heavens I'll go:,9
I'll take the better care but if you will not,9
The hands of Romans!,9
No reason I since of your lives you set,9
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you boys!,9
That is my bed too lads an there I'll lie:,9
Aside,9
thinks scorn,9
Exeunt,9
SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.,9
Yea bloody cloth I'll keep thee for I wish'd,9
If each of you should take this course how many,9
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!,9
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you,9
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved,9
Me wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,9
To have them fall no more: you some permit,9
And make them dread it to the doers' thrift.,9
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither,9
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough,9
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore good heavens,9
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself,9
Against the part I come with; so I'll die,9
Is every breath a death; and thus unknown,9
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know,9
Gods put the strength o' the Leonati in me!,9
The fashion less without and more within.,9
SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.,9
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom,9
The princess of this country and the air on't,9
A very drudge of nature's have subdued me,9
As I wear mine are titles but of scorn.,9
This lout as he exceeds our lords the odds,9
Exit,9
Stand stand! We have the advantage of the ground;,9
The villany of our fears.,9
Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS and IACHIMO with IMOGEN,9
For friends kill friends and the disorder's such,9
Tis their fresh supplies.,9
Let's reinforce or fly.,9
SCENE III. Another part of the field.,9
Camest thou from where they made the stand?,9
Though you it seems come from the fliers.,9
No blame be to you sir; for all was lost,9
Of his wings destitute the army broken,9
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,9
More plentiful than tools to do't struck down,9
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd,9
To die with lengthen'd shame.,9
Close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf;,9
An honest one I warrant; who deserved,9
In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,9
The country base than to commit such slaughter,9
Than those for preservation cased or shame--,9
Our Britain s harts die flying not our men:,9
Or we are Romans and will give you that,9
But to look back in frown: stand stand.',9
Three thousand confident in act as many--,9
The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand stand',9
With their own nobleness which could have turn'd,9
Part shame part spirit renew'd; that some,9
But by example--O a sin in war,9
The way that they did and to grin like lions,9
A stop i' the chaser a retire anon,9
Chickens the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,9
Like fragments in hard voyages became,9
Of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound!,9
O'er borne i' the former wave: ten chased by one,9
Those that would die or ere resist are grown,9
This was strange chance,9
Nay do not wonder at it: you are made,9
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,9
Two boys an old man twice a boy a lane,9
Nay be not angry sir.,9
Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend;,9
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.,9
Farewell; you're angry.,9
Exit Lord,9
To be i' the field and ask 'what news?' of me!,9
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,9
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,9
Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds,9
That draw his knives i' the war. Well I will find him,9
No more a Briton I have resumed again,9
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall,9
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be,9
On either side I come to spend my breath;,9
But end it by some means for Imogen.,9
Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.,9
There was a fourth man in a silly habit,9
So 'tis reported:,9
A Roman,9
Had answer'd him.,9
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell,9
his service,9
Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS  PISANIO Soldiers Attendants and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes,9
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers,9
So graze as you find pasture.,9
Exeunt Gaolers,9
think to liberty: yet am I better,9
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured,9
To unbar these locks. My conscience thou art fetter'd,9
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,9
So children temporal fathers do appease;,9
I cannot do it better than in gyves,9
If of my freedom 'tis the main part take,9
I know you are more clement than vile men,9
A sixth a tenth letting them thrive again,9
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though,9
Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;,9
You rather mine being yours: and so great powers,9
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!,9
Sleeps,9
No more thou thunder-master show,9
With Mars fall out with Juno chide,9
Rates and revenges.,9
Whose face I never saw?,9
Attending nature's law:,9
Thou orphans' father art,9
From this earth-vexing smart.,9
But took me in my throes;,9
Came crying 'mongst his foes,9
Great nature like his ancestry,9
That he deserved the praise o' the world,9
When once he was mature for man,9
That could stand up his parallel;,9
In eye of Imogen that best,9
With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,9
From Leonati seat and cast,9
Sweet Imogen?,9
Slight thing of Italy,9
With needless jealosy;,9
O' th' other's villany?,9
Our parents and us twain,9
Fell bravely and were slain,9
With honour to maintain.,9
To Cymbeline perform'd:,9
Why hast thou thus adjourn'd,9
Being all to dolours turn'd?,9
No longer exercise,9
And potent injuries.,9
Take off his miseries.,9
Or we poor ghosts will cry,9
Against thy deity.,9
And from thy justice fly.,9
No more you petty spirits of region low,9
Accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know,9
Poor shadows of Elysium hence and rest,9
Be not with mortal accidents opprest;,9
Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,9
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:,9
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth and in,9
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,9
This tablet lay upon his breast wherein,9
and so away: no further with your din,9
Mount eagle to my palace crystalline.,9
He came in thunder; his celestial breath,9
Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is,9
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,9
Thanks Jupiter!,9
His radiant root. Away! and to be blest,9
The Apparitions vanish,9
A father to me; and thou hast created,9
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:,9
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,9
Many dream not to find neither deserve,9
That have this golden chance and know not why.,9
Be not as is our fangled world a garment,9
So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,9
Reads,9
without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of,9
lopped branches which being dead many years,9
freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,9
Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen,9
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such,9
The action of my life is like it which,9
Re-enter First Gaoler,9
Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.,9
you be ready for that you are well cooked.,9
spectators the dish pays the shot.,9
you shall be called to no more payments fear no,9
parting as the procuring of mirth: you come in,9
much drink; sorry that you have paid too much and,9
both empty; the brain the heavier for being too,9
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be,9
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and,9
the discharge: your neck sir is pen book and,9
I am merrier to die than thou art to live.,9
tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your,9
would change places with his officer; for look you,9
Yes indeed do I fellow.,9
him so pictured: you must either be directed by,9
yourself that which I am sure you do not know or,9
you shall speed in your journey's end I think you'll,9
I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to,9
will not use them.,9
have the best use of eyes to see the way of,9
Enter a Messenger,9
Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.,9
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.,9
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young,9
conscience there are verier knaves desire to live,9
too that die against their wills; so should I if I,9
mind good; O there were desolation of gaolers and,9
my wish hath a preferment in 't.,9
SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.,9
Stand by my side you whom the gods have made,9
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,9
Stepp'd before larges of proof cannot be found:,9
Our grace can make him so.,9
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;,9
But beggary and poor looks.,9
He hath been search'd among the dead and living,9
To my grief I am,9
To BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
To you the liver heart and brain of Britain,9
To ask of whence you are. Report it.,9
In Cambria are we born and gentlemen:,9
Unless I add we are honest.,9
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you,9
With dignities becoming your estates.,9
There's business in these faces. Why so sadly,9
And not o' the court of Britain.,9
To sour your happiness I must report,9
Who worse than a physician,9
By medicine life may be prolong'd yet death,9
With horror madly dying like her life,9
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd,9
Can trip me if I err; who with wet cheeks,9
Prithee say.,9
Affected greatness got by you not you:,9
Abhorr'd your person.,9
And but she spoke it dying I would not,9
Your daughter whom she bore in hand to love,9
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,9
Ta'en off by poison.,9
Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?,9
For you a mortal mineral; which being took,9
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,9
O'ercome you with her show and in time,9
Her son into the adoption of the crown:,9
Grew shameless-desperate; open'd in despite,9
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so,9
Heard you all this her women?,9
Mine eyes,9
Mine ears that heard her flattery; nor my heart,9
been vicious,9
That it was folly in me thou mayst say,9
Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO the Soothsayer and other  Roman Prisoners guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind and IMOGEN,9
The Britons have razed out though with the loss,9
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter,9
So think of your estate.,9
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,9
have threaten'd,9
Will have it thus that nothing but our lives,9
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:,9
For my peculiar care. This one thing only,9
Let him be ransom'd: never master had,9
So tender over his occasions true,9
With my request which I make bold your highness,9
Though he have served a Roman: save him sir,9
I have surely seen him:,9
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,9
To say 'live boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:,9
Fitting my bounty and thy state I'll give it;,9
The noblest ta'en.,9
I do not bid thee beg my life good lad;,9
No no: alack,9
Bitter to me as death: your life good master,9
The boy disdains me,9
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.,9
What wouldst thou boy?,9
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,9
He is a Roman; no more kin to me,9
Am something nearer.,9
I'll tell you sir in private if you please,9
Ay with all my heart,9
Fidele sir.,9
I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.,9
Is not this boy revived from death?,9
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad,9
The same dead thing alive.,9
Creatures may be alike: were 't he I am sure,9
But we saw him dead.,9
[Aside] It is my mistress:,9
To good or bad.,9
Come stand thou by our side;,9
To IACHIMO,9
Give answer to this boy and do it freely;,9
Which is our honour bitter torture shall,9
My boon is that this gentleman may render,9
[Aside]                 What's that to him?,9
How came it yours?,9
Which to be spoke would torture thee.,9
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that,9
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;,9
grieve thee,9
Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more my lord?,9
That paragon thy daughter--,9
Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.,9
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will,9
Upon a time--unhappy was the clock,9
The mansion where!--'twas at a feast--O would,9
Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--,9
Where ill men were; and was the best of all,9
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy,9
Of him that best could speak for feature laming,9
Postures beyond brief nature for condition,9
Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving,9
I stand on fire:,9
All too soon I shall,9
Most like a noble lord in love and one,9
And not dispraising whom we praised--therein,9
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue,9
And then a mind put in't either our brags,9
Proved us unspeaking sots.,9
Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.,9
And she alone were cold: whereat I wretch,9
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore,9
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring,9
No lesser of her honour confident,9
And would so had it been a carbuncle,9
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain,9
Remember me at court; where I was taught,9
Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd,9
Gan in your duller Britain operate,9
And to be brief my practise so prevail'd,9
To make the noble Leonatus mad,9
With tokens thus and thus; averting notes,9
O cunning how I got it!--nay some marks,9
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,9
Methinks I see him now--,9
Italian fiend! Ay me most credulous fool,9
That's due to all the villains past in being,9
Some upright justicer! Thou king send out,9
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend,9
That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like I lie--,9
A sacrilegious thief to do't: the temple,9
Spit and throw stone s cast mire upon me set,9
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and,9
My queen my life my wife! O Imogen,9
Peace my lord; hear hear--,9
There lie thy part.,9
O gentlemen help!,9
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help help!,9
Does the world go round?,9
Wake my mistress!,9
To death with mortal joy.,9
O get thee from my sight;,9
Breathe not where princes are.,9
Lady,9
That box I gave you was not thought by me,9
New matter still?,9
O gods!,9
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio,9
Which I gave him for cordial she is served,9
What's this Comelius?,9
To temper poisons for her still pretending,9
In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs,9
Was of more danger did compound for her,9
The present power of life but in short time,9
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?,9
My boys,9
This is sure Fidele.,9
Think that you are upon a rock; and now,9
Embracing him,9
Till the tree die!,9
What makest thou me a dullard in this act?,9
[Kneeling]               Your blessing sir.,9
this youth I blame ye not:,9
My tears that fall,9
Thy mother's dead.,9
O she was nought; and long of her it was,9
Is gone we know not how nor where.,9
Now fear is from me I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,9
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth and swore,9
It was my instant death. By accident,9
Then in my pocket; which directed him,9
Where in a frenzy in my master's garments,9
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate,9
I further know not.,9
I slew him there.,9
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips,9
Deny't again.,9
He was a prince.,9
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me,9
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;,9
To tell this tale of mine.,9
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must,9
That headless man,9
Bind the offender,9
Stay sir king:,9
As well descended as thyself; and hath,9
Had ever scar for.,9
Let his arms alone;,9
Why old soldier,9
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent,9
In that he spake too far.,9
We will die all three:,9
As I have given out him. My sons I must,9
Though haply well for you.,9
And our good his.,9
Thou hadst great king a subject who,9
What of him? he is,9
He it is that hath,9
I know not how a traitor.,9
The whole world shall not save him.,9
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;,9
As I have received it.,9
I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:,9
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,9
And think they are my sons are none of mine;,9
And blood of your begetting.,9
So sure as you your father's. I old Morgan,9
Your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment,9
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--,9
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I,9
Your highness knows. Their nurse Euriphile,9
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,9
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty,9
The more of you 'twas felt the more it shaped,9
Here are your sons again; and I must lose,9
The benediction of these covering heavens,9
To inlay heaven with stars.,9
The service that you three have done is more,9
If these be they I know not how to wish,9
Be pleased awhile.,9
Most worthy prince as yours is true Guiderius:,9
Your younger princely son; he sir was lapp'd,9
Of his queen mother which for more probation,9
Guiderius had,9
It was a mark of wonder.,9
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:,9
To be his evidence now.,9
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother,9
That after this strange starting from your orbs,9
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.,9
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,9
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,9
When ye were so indeed.,9
Ay my good lord.,9
Continued so until we thought he died.,9
O rare instinct!,9
abridgement,9
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?,9
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?,9
And your three motives to the battle with,9
And all the other by-dependencies,9
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,9
And she like harmless lightning throws her eye,9
Each object with a joy: the counterchange,9
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.,9
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.,9
To see this gracious season.,9
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,9
My good master,9
Happy be you!,9
He would have well becomed this place and graced,9
I am sir,9
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for,9
Speak Iachimo: I had you down and might,9
[Kneeling]          I am down again:,9
As then your force did. Take that life beseech you,9
And here the bracelet of the truest princess,9
Kneel not to me:,9
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,9
Nobly doom'd!,9
Pardon's the word to all.,9
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;,9
Your servant princes. Good my lord of Rome,9
Great Jupiter upon his eagle back'd,9
Of mine own kindred: when I waked I found,9
Is so from sense in hardness that I can,9
His skill in the construction.,9
Here my good lord.,9
[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall to himself,9
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar,9
years shall after revive be jointed to the old,9
his miseries Britain be fortunate and flourish in,9
Thou Leonatus art the lion's whelp;,9
Being Leonatus doth import so much.,9
The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter,9
We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine,9
Answering the letter of the oracle,9
With this most tender air.,9
The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline,9
Thy two sons forth; who by Belarius stol'n,9
To the majestic cedar join'd whose issue,9
Well,9
Although the victor we submit to Caesar,9
To pay our wonted tribute from the which,9
Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers,9
The fingers of the powers above do tune,9
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke,9
Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,9
Lessen'd herself and in the beams o' the sun,9
The imperial Caesar should again unite,9
Which shines here in the west.,9
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils,9
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let,9
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:,9
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.,9
Ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace.,9
ACT I,10
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO,10
Nay answer me: stand and unfold yourself.,10
Bernardo?,10
You come most carefully upon your hour.,10
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,10
Have you had quiet guard?,10
Well good night.,10
The rivals of my watch bid them make haste.,10
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS,10
And liegemen to the Dane.,10
O farewell honest soldier:,10
Bernardo has my place.,10
Exit,10
Say,10
A piece of him.,10
What has this thing appear'd again to-night?,10
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,10
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us:,10
With us to watch the minutes of this night;,10
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.,10
Sit down awhile;,10
That are so fortified against our story,10
Well sit we down,10
Last night of all,10
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven,10
The bell then beating one--,10
Peace break thee off; look where it comes again!,10
Thou art a scholar; speak to it Horatio.,10
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.,10
Question it Horatio.,10
Together with that fair and warlike form,10
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee speak!,10
See it stalks away!,10
Exit Ghost,10
How now Horatio! you tremble and look pale:,10
What think you on't?,10
Without the sensible and true avouch,10
Is it not like the king?,10
Such was the very armour he had on,10
So frown'd he once when in an angry parle,10
Tis strange.,10
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.,10
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,10
Good now sit down and tell me he that knows,10
So nightly toils the subject of the land,10
And foreign mart for implements of war;,10
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;,10
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:,10
That can I;,10
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,10
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,10
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--,10
Well ratified by law and heraldry,10
Which he stood seized of to the conqueror:,10
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd,10
Had he been vanquisher; as by the same covenant,10
His fell to Hamlet. Now sir young Fortinbras,10
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there,10
For food and diet to some enterprise,10
As it doth well appear unto our state--,10
And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands,10
Is the main motive of our preparations,10
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.,10
Well may it sort that this portentous figure,10
That was and is the question of these wars.,10
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,10
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead,10
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,10
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,10
And even the like precurse of fierce events,10
And prologue to the omen coming on,10
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--,10
Re-enter Ghost,10
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,10
If there be any good thing to be done,10
Speak to me:,10
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,10
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life,10
For which they say you spirits oft walk in death,10
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?,10
Tis here!,10
Tis gone!,10
We do it wrong being so majestical,10
For it is as the air invulnerable,10
It was about to speak when the cock crew.,10
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,10
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat,10
Whether in sea or fire in earth or air,10
To his confine: and of the truth herein,10
It faded on the crowing of the cock.,10
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,10
And then they say no spirit dares stir abroad;,10
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm,10
So have I heard and do in part believe it.,10
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:,10
Let us impart what we have seen to-night,10
This spirit dumb to us will speak to him.,10
As needful in our loves fitting our duty?,10
Where we shall find him most conveniently.,10
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.,10
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death,10
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom,10
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature,10
Together with remembrance of ourselves.,10
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,10
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,10
In equal scale weighing delight and dole--,10
Your better wisdoms which have freely gone,10
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,10
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death,10
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,10
Importing the surrender of those lands,10
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.,10
Thus much the business is: we have here writ,10
Who impotent and bed-rid scarcely hears,10
His further gait herein; in that the levies,10
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch,10
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;,10
To business with the king more than the scope,10
Farewell and let your haste commend your duty.,10
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.,10
And now Laertes what's the news with you?,10
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,10
That shall not be my offer not thy asking?,10
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,10
What wouldst thou have Laertes?,10
Your leave and favour to return to France;,10
To show my duty in your coronation,10
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,10
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?,10
By laboursome petition and at last,10
I do beseech you give him leave to go.,10
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!,10
[Aside]  A little more than kin and less than kind.,10
Not so my lord; I am too much i' the sun.,10
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.,10
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:,10
Passing through nature to eternity.,10
If it be,10
Seems madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.',10
Nor customary suits of solemn black,10
No nor the fruitful river in the eye,10
Together with all forms moods shapes of grief,10
For they are actions that a man might play:,10
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.,10
To give these mourning duties to your father:,10
That father lost lost his and the survivor bound,10
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever,10
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;,10
A heart unfortified a mind impatient,10
For what we know must be and is as common,10
Why should we in our peevish opposition,10
A fault against the dead a fault to nature,10
Is death of fathers and who still hath cried,10
This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth,10
As of a father: for let the world take note,10
And with no less nobility of love,10
Do I impart toward you. For your intent,10
It is most retrograde to our desire:,10
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,10
Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet:,10
I shall in all my best obey you madam.,10
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam come;,10
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,10
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,10
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.,10
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,10
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd,10
How weary stale flat and unprofitable,10
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,10
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!,10
So excellent a king; that was to this,10
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven,10
Must I remember? why she would hang on him,10
By what it fed on: and yet within a month--,10
A little month or ere those shoes were old,10
Like Niobe all tears:--why she even she--,10
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,10
Than I to Hercules: within a month:,10
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,10
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!,10
But break my heart; for I must hold my tongue.,10
Hail to your lordship!,10
Horatio--or I do forget myself.,10
Sir my good friend; I'll change that name with you:,10
My good lord--,10
But what in faith make you from Wittenberg?,10
I would not hear your enemy say so,10
To make it truster of your own report,10
But what is your affair in Elsinore?,10
My lord I came to see your father's funeral.,10
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.,10
Thrift thrift Horatio! the funeral baked meats,10
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven,10
My father!--methinks I see my father.,10
In my mind's eye Horatio.,10
He was a man take him for all in all,10
My lord I think I saw him yesternight.,10
My lord the king your father.,10
Season your admiration for awhile,10
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,10
For God's love let me hear.,10
Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch,10
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,10
Appears before them and with solemn march,10
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,10
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,10
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;,10
Where as they had deliver'd both in time,10
The apparition comes: I knew your father;,10
But where was this?,10
Did you not speak to it?,10
But answer made it none: yet once methought,10
Itself to motion like as it would speak;,10
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,10
Tis very strange.,10
And we did think it writ down in our duty,10
Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me.,10
We do my lord.,10
Arm'd my lord.,10
My lord from head to foot.,10
O yes my lord; he wore his beaver up.,10
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.,10
Nay very pale.,10
Most constantly.,10
It would have much amazed you.,10
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.,10
Not when I saw't.,10
It was as I have seen it in his life,10
I will watch to-night;,10
I warrant it will.,10
I'll speak to it though hell itself should gape,10
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,10
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,10
I will requite your loves. So fare you well:,10
I'll visit you.,10
Your loves as mine to you: farewell.,10
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;,10
Till then sit still my soul: foul deeds will rise,10
Exit,10
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA,10
And sister as the winds give benefit,10
But let me hear from you.,10
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,10
A violet in the youth of primy nature,10
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.,10
Think it no more;,10
In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes,10
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,10
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,10
For he himself is subject to his birth:,10
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends,10
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed,10
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,10
As he in his particular act and place,10
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.,10
If with too credent ear you list his songs,10
To his unmaster'd importunity.,10
And keep you in the rear of your affection,10
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,10
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:,10
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,10
Contagious blastments are most imminent.,10
Youth to itself rebels though none else near.,10
As watchman to my heart. But good my brother,10
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;,10
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,10
O fear me not.,10
Enter POLONIUS,10
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.,10
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,10
And these few precepts in thy memory,10
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.,10
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried,10
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment,10
Of entrance to a quarrel but being in,10
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice;,10
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,10
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,10
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.,10
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,10
This above all: to thine ownself be true,10
Thou canst not then be false to any man.,10
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord.,10
Farewell Ophelia; and remember well,10
Tis in my memory lock'd,10
Farewell.,10
What is't Ophelia be hath said to you?,10
Marry well bethought:,10
Given private time to you; and you yourself,10
If it be so as so 'tis put on me,10
You do not understand yourself so clearly,10
What is between you? give me up the truth.,10
Of his affection to me.,10
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.,10
I do not know my lord what I should think.,10
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,10
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,10
My lord he hath importuned me with love,10
Ay fashion you may call it; go to go to.,10
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.,10
When the blood burns how prodigal the soul,10
Giving more light than heat extinct in both,10
You must not take for fire. From this time,10
Set your entreatments at a higher rate,10
Believe so much in him that he is young,10
Than may be given you: in few Ophelia,10
Not of that dye which their investments show,10
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,10
I would not in plain terms from this time forth,10
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.,10
I shall obey my lord.,10
SCENE IV. The platform.,10
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.,10
What hour now?,10
No it is struck.,10
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.,10
What does this mean my lord?,10
Keeps wassail and the swaggering up-spring reels;,10
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out,10
Is it a custom?,10
But to my mind though I am native here,10
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.,10
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:,10
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes,10
The pith and marrow of our attribute.,10
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,10
Since nature cannot choose his origin--,10
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,10
The form of plausive manners that these men,10
Being nature's livery or fortune's star--,10
As infinite as man may undergo--,10
From that particular fault: the dram of eale,10
To his own scandal.,10
Enter Ghost,10
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,10
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,10
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,10
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell,10
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,10
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,10
That thou dead corse again in complete steel,10
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature,10
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?,10
Ghost beckons HAMLET,10
As if it some impartment did desire,10
Look with what courteous action,10
But do not go with it.,10
It will not speak; then I will follow it.,10
Why what should be the fear?,10
And for my soul what can it do to that,10
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.,10
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff,10
And there assume some other horrible form,10
And draw you into madness? think of it:,10
Without more motive into every brain,10
And hears it roar beneath.,10
Go on; I'll follow thee.,10
Hold off your hands.,10
My fate cries out,10
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.,10
By heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!,10
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET,10
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.,10
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.,10
Nay let's follow him.,10
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.,10
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.,10
I will.,10
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames,10
Alas poor ghost!,10
To what I shall unfold.,10
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.,10
I am thy father's spirit,10
And for the day confined to fast in fires,10
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid,10
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word,10
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,10
And each particular hair to stand on end,10
But this eternal blazon must not be,10
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--,10
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.,10
Murder most foul as in the best it is;,10
Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift,10
May sweep to my revenge.,10
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed,10
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now Hamlet hear:,10
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark,10
Rankly abused: but know thou noble youth,10
Now wears his crown.,10
Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast,10
O wicked wit and gifts that have the power,10
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:,10
From me whose love was of that dignity,10
I made to her in marriage and to decline,10
To those of mine!,10
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,10
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,10
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;,10
My custom always of the afternoon,10
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,10
The leperous distilment; whose effect,10
That swift as quicksilver it courses through,10
And with a sudden vigour doth posset,10
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;,10
Most lazar-like with vile and loathsome crust,10
Thus was I sleeping by a brother's hand,10
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,10
No reckoning made but sent to my account,10
O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!,10
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be,10
But howsoever thou pursuest this act,10
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,10
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!,10
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:,10
Exit,10
And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold hold my heart;,10
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!,10
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!,10
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,10
That youth and observation copied there;,10
Within the book and volume of my brain,10
O most pernicious woman!,10
My tables--meet it is I set it down,10
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:,10
So uncle there you are. Now to my word;,10
I have sworn 't.,10
[Within] Lord Hamlet--,10
So be it!,10
Hillo ho ho boy! come bird come.,10
How is't my noble lord?,10
O wonderful!,10
No; you'll reveal it.,10
Nor I my lord.,10
But you'll be secret?,10
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark,10
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave,10
Why right; you are i' the right;,10
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:,10
For every man has business and desire,10
Look you I'll go pray.,10
I'm sorry they offend you heartily;,10
There's no offence my lord.,10
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,10
For your desire to know what is between us,10
As you are friends scholars and soldiers,10
What is't my lord? we will.,10
My lord we will not.,10
In faith,10
Nor I my lord in faith.,10
We have sworn my lord already.,10
[Beneath]  Swear.,10
truepenny?,10
Consent to swear.,10
Never to speak of this that you have seen,10
[Beneath]  Swear.,10
Come hither gentlemen,10
Never to speak of this that you have heard,10
[Beneath]  Swear.,10
A worthy pioner! Once more remove good friends.,10
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.,10
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;,10
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,10
To put an antic disposition on,10
With arms encumber'd thus or this headshake,10
As 'Well well we know' or 'We could an if we would',10
Or such ambiguous giving out to note,10
So grace and mercy at your most need help you Swear.,10
Rest rest perturbed spirit!,10
So gentlemen,10
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is,10
God willing shall not lack. Let us go in together;,10
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,10
Nay come let's go together.,10
ACT II,10
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO,10
I will my lord.,10
Before you visit him to make inquire,10
My lord I did intend it.,10
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;,10
What company at what expense; and finding,10
That they do know my son come you more nearer,10
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him;,10
And in part him: ' do you mark this Reynaldo?,10
And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:,10
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him,10
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;,10
As are companions noted and most known,10
As gaming my lord.,10
Drabbing: you may go so far.,10
Faith no; as you may season it in the charge,10
That he is open to incontinency;,10
That they may seem the taints of liberty,10
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,10
But my good lord--,10
Ay my lord,10
Marry sir here's my drift;,10
You laying these slight sullies on my son,10
Your party in converse him you would sound,10
The youth you breathe of guilty be assured,10
Good sir' or so or 'friend' or 'gentleman',10
Of man and country.,10
And then sir does he this--he does--what was I,10
something: where did I leave?,10
and 'gentleman.',10
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;,10
Or then or then; with such or such; and as you say,10
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,10
Videlicet a brothel or so forth.,10
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:,10
With windlasses and with assays of bias,10
So by my former lecture and advice,10
My lord I have.,10
Good my lord!,10
I shall my lord.,10
Well my lord.,10
Exit REYNALDO,10
How now Ophelia! what's the matter?,10
With what i' the name of God?,10
Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced;,10
Ungarter'd and down-gyved to his ancle;,10
And with a look so piteous in purport,10
To speak of horrors--he comes before me.,10
My lord I do not know;,10
What said he?,10
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;,10
He falls to such perusal of my face,10
At last a little shaking of mine arm,10
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound,10
And end his being: that done he lets me go:,10
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;,10
And to the last bended their light on me.,10
This is the very ecstasy of love,10
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,10
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.,10
No my good lord but as you did command,10
His access to me.,10
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment,10
And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!,10
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,10
To lack discretion. Come go we to the king:,10
move,10
Exeunt,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and Attendants,10
Moreover that we much did long to see you,10
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard,10
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man,10
More than his father's death that thus hath put him,10
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,10
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,10
Some little time: so by your companies,10
So much as from occasion you may glean,10
That open'd lies within our remedy.,10
And sure I am two men there are not living,10
To show us so much gentry and good will,10
For the supply and profit of our hope,10
As fits a king's remembrance.,10
Might by the sovereign power you have of us,10
Than to entreaty.,10
And here give up ourselves in the full bent,10
To be commanded.,10
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:,10
My too much changed son. Go some of you,10
Heavens make our presence and our practises,10
Ay amen!,10
Enter POLONIUS,10
Are joyfully return'd.,10
Have I my lord? I assure my good liege,10
Both to my God and to my gracious king:,10
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure,10
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.,10
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;,10
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in.,10
He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found,10
I doubt it is no other but the main;,10
Well we shall sift him.,10
Welcome my good friends!,10
Most fair return of greetings and desires.,10
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd,10
But better look'd into he truly found,10
That so his sickness age and impotence,10
On Fortinbras; which he in brief obeys;,10
Makes vow before his uncle never more,10
Whereon old Norway overcome with joy,10
And his commission to employ those soldiers,10
With an entreaty herein further shown,10
That it might please you to give quiet pass,10
On such regards of safety and allowance,10
It likes us well;,10
Answer and think upon this business.,10
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:,10
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS,10
My liege and madam to expostulate,10
Why day is day night night and time is time,10
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit,10
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:,10
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?,10
More matter with less art.,10
That he is mad 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;,10
But farewell it for I will use no art.,10
That we find out the cause of this effect,10
For this effect defective comes by cause:,10
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--,10
Hath given me this: now gather and surmise.,10
To the celestial and my soul's idol the most,10
That's an ill phrase a vile phrase; 'beautified' is,10
Reads,10
Came this from Hamlet to her?,10
Reads,10
Doubt that the sun doth move;,10
But never doubt I love.,10
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that,10
Thine evermore most dear lady whilst,10
This in obedience hath my daughter shown me,10
As they fell out by time by means and place,10
But how hath she,10
What do you think of me?,10
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,10
As I perceived it I must tell you that,10
Or my dear majesty your queen here think,10
Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb,10
What might you think? No I went round to work,10
Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star;,10
That she should lock herself from his resort,10
Which done she took the fruits of my advice;,10
Fell into a sadness then into a fast,10
Thence to a lightness and by this declension,10
And all we mourn for.,10
It may be very likely.,10
That I have positively said 'Tis so',10
Not that I know.,10
Take this from this if this be otherwise:,10
Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed,10
How may we try it further?,10
Here in the lobby.,10
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:,10
Mark the encounter: if he love her not,10
Let me be no assistant for a state,10
We will try it.,10
Away I do beseech you both away:,10
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE and Attendants,10
O give me leave:,10
Well God-a-mercy.,10
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.,10
Then I would you were so honest a man.,10
Ay sir; to be honest as this world goes is to be,10
That's very true my lord.,10
god kissing carrion--Have you a daughter?,10
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a,10
Friend look to 't.,10
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I,10
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for,10
What do you read my lord?,10
What is the matter my lord?,10
I mean the matter that you read my lord.,10
that old men have grey beards that their faces are,10
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of,10
though I most powerfully and potently believe yet,10
yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab,10
[Aside]  Though this be madness yet there is method,10
Into my grave.,10
Aside,10
that often madness hits on which reason and sanity,10
leave him and suddenly contrive the means of,10
lord I will most humbly take my leave of you.,10
more willingly part withal: except my life except,10
Fare you well my lord.,10
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
[To POLONIUS]  God save you sir!,10
My honoured lord!,10
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,10
As the indifferent children of the earth.,10
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.,10
Neither my lord.,10
her favours?,10
In the secret parts of fortune? O most true; she,10
None my lord but that the world's grown honest.,10
Let me question more in particular: what have you,10
that she sends you to prison hither?,10
Denmark's a prison.,10
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,10
We think not so my lord.,10
either good or bad but thinking makes it so: to me,10
Why then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too,10
O God I could be bounded in a nut shell and count,10

substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.,10
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a,10
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and,10
to the court? for by my fay I cannot reason.,10
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest,10
man I am most dreadfully attended. But in the,10
To visit you my lord; no other occasion.,10
thank you: and sure dear friends my thanks are,10
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,10
What should we say my lord?,10
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks,10
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.,10
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by,10
our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved,10
charge you withal be even and direct with me,10
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?,10
love me hold not off.,10
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation,10
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but,10
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily,10
earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most,10
o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted,10
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.,10
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how,10
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the,10
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not,10
you seem to say so.,10
Why did you laugh then when I said 'man delights not me'?,10
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from,10
coming to offer you service.,10
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight,10
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part,10
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall,10
for't. What players are they?,10
tragedians of the city.,10
in reputation and profit was better both ways.,10
late innovation.,10
in the city? are they so followed?,10
How comes it? do they grow rusty?,10
there is sir an aery of children little eyases,10
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the,10
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of,10
What are they children? who maintains 'em? how are,10
longer than they can sing? will they not say,10
players--as it is most like if their means are no,10
exclaim against their own succession?,10
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to,10
for argument unless the poet and the player went to,10
Is't possible?,10
Do the boys carry it away?,10
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of,10
my father lived give twenty forty fifty an,10
Sblood there is something in this more than,10
Flourish of trumpets within,10
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,10
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,10
must show fairly outward should more appear like,10
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.,10
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is,10
Enter POLONIUS,10
Hark you Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a,10
out of his swaddling-clouts.,10
say an old man is twice a child.,10
mark it. You say right sir: o' Monday morning;,10
My lord I have news to tell you.,10
When Roscius was an actor in Rome--,10
Buz buz!,10
Then came each actor on his ass--,10
comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical,10
comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or,10
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the,10
O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou!,10
Why,10
The which he loved passing well.',10
Am I not i' the right old Jephthah?,10
that I love passing well.,10
What follows then my lord?,10
As by lot God wot',10
It came to pass as most like it was'--,10
more; for look where my abridgement comes.,10
You are welcome masters; welcome all. I am glad,10
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:,10
lady and mistress! By'r lady your ladyship is,10
altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice like,10
ring. Masters you are all welcome. We'll e'en,10
we'll have a speech straight: come give us a taste,10
What speech my lord?,10
never acted; or if it was not above once; for the,10
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received,10
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play well,10
modesty as cunning. I remember one said there,10
savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might,10
honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very,10
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and,10
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory begin,10
The rugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beast'--,10
The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms,10
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,10
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot,10
With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons,10
That lend a tyrannous and damned light,10
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,10
Old grandsire Priam seeks.',10
Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and,10
Anon he finds him,10
Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls,10
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;,10
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,10
Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash,10
Which was declining on the milky head,10
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood,10
Did nothing.,10
A silence in the heavens the rack stand still,10
As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder,10
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;,10
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne,10
Now falls on Priam.,10
In general synod 'take away her power;,10
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,10
This is too long.,10
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he,10
But who O who had seen the mobled queen--',10
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.,10
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head,10
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,10
Who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd,10
pronounced:,10
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport,10
The instant burst of clamour that she made,10
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,10
Look whether he has not turned his colour and has,10
Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.,10
bestowed? Do you hear let them be well used; for,10
time: after your death you were better have a bad,10
My lord I will use them according to their desert.,10
after his desert and who should 'scape whipping?,10
they deserve the more merit is in your bounty.,10
Come sirs.,10
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First,10
Murder of Gonzago?,10
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could for a need,10
I would set down and insert in't could you not?,10
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him,10
Exit First Player,10
welcome to Elsinore.,10
Ay so God be wi' ye;,10
Now I am alone.,10
Is it not monstrous that this player here,10
Could force his soul so to his own conceit,10
Tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect,10
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!,10
What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba,10
Had he the motive and the cue for passion,10
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,10
Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed,10
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak,10
And can say nothing; no not for a king,10
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?,10
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?,10
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?,10
Swounds I should take it: for it cannot be,10
To make oppression bitter or ere this,10
With this slave's offal: bloody bawdy villain!,10
O vengeance!,10
That I the son of a dear father murder'd,10
Must like a whore unpack my heart with words,10
A scullion!,10
That guilty creatures sitting at a play,10
Been struck so to the soul that presently,10
For murder though it have no tongue will speak,10
Play something like the murder of my father,10
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,10
May be the devil: and the devil hath power,10
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,10
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds,10
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.,10
ACT III,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE POLONIUS OPHELIA ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,10
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?,10
But from what cause he will by no means speak.,10
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof,10
Of his true state.,10
Most like a gentleman.,10
Niggard of question; but of our demands,10
Did you assay him?,10
Madam it so fell out that certain players,10
And there did seem in him a kind of joy,10
And as I think they have already order,10
Tis most true:,10
To hear and see the matter.,10
To hear him so inclined.,10
And drive his purpose on to these delights.,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,10
Affront Ophelia:,10
Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen,10
And gather by him as he is behaved,10
That thus he suffers for.,10
And for your part Ophelia I do wish,10
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues,10
To both your honours.,10
Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE,10
We will bestow ourselves.,10
Read on this book;,10
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this--,10
And pious action we do sugar o'er,10
[Aside]          O 'tis too true!,10
The harlot's cheek beautied with plastering art,10
Than is my deed to my most painted word:,10
I hear him coming: let's withdraw my lord.,10
Enter HAMLET,10
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer,10
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,10
No more; and by a sleep to say we end,10
That flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation,10
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay there's the rub;,10
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,10
That makes calamity of so long life;,10
The oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely,10
The insolence of office and the spurns,10
When he himself might his quietus make,10
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,10
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn,10
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,10
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;,10
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,10
With this regard their currents turn awry,10
The fair Ophelia! Nymph in thy orisons,10
Good my lord,10
I humbly thank you; well well well.,10
That I have longed long to re-deliver;,10
No not I;,10
My honour'd lord you know right well you did;,10
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,10
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.,10
Ha ha! are you honest?,10
Are you fair?,10
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should,10
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than,10
Ay truly; for the power of beauty will sooner,10
force of honesty can translate beauty into his,10
time gives it proof. I did love you once.,10
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot,10
it: I loved you not.,10
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a,10
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it,10
proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at,10
imagination to give them shape or time to act them,10
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,10
Where's your father?,10
Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the,10
O help him you sweet heavens!,10
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice as pure as,10
nunnery go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs,10
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery go,10
O heavenly powers restore him!,10
has given you one face and you make yourselves,10
nick-name God's creatures and make your wantonness,10
made me mad. I say we will have no more marriages:,10
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a,10
Exit,10
The courtier's soldier's scholar's eye tongue sword;,10
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,10
And I of ladies most deject and wretched,10
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,10
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth,10
To have seen what I have seen see what I see!,10
Love! his affections do not that way tend;,10
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,10
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose,10
I have in quick determination,10
For the demand of our neglected tribute,10
With variable objects shall expel,10
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus,10
It shall do well: but yet do I believe,10
Sprung from neglected love. How now Ophelia!,10
We heard it all. My lord do as you please;,10
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him,10
And I'll be placed so please you in the ear,10
To England send him or confine him where,10
It shall be so:,10
Exeunt,10
Enter HAMLET and Players,10
you trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,10
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air,10
for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say,10
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O it,10
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to,10
for the most part are capable of nothing but,10
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it,10
I warrant your honour.,10
be your tutor: suit the action to the word the,10
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is,10
first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the,10
scorn her own image and the very age and body of,10
or come tardy off though it make the unskilful,10
censure of the which one must in your allowance,10
players that I have seen play and heard others,10
that neither having the accent of Christians nor,10
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of,10
well they imitated humanity so abominably.,10
sir.,10
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;,10
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh,10
question of the play be then to be considered:,10
in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.,10
Enter POLONIUS ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
And the queen too and that presently.,10
Exit POLONIUS,10
We will my lord.,10
What ho! Horatio!,10
Here sweet lord at your service.,10
As e'er my conversation coped withal.,10
Nay do not think I flatter;,10
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,10
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,10
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?,10
And could of men distinguish her election,10
As one in suffering all that suffers nothing,10
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those,10
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger,10
That is not passion's slave and I will wear him,10
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--,10
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,10
I prithee when thou seest that act afoot,10
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt,10
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,10
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;,10
And after we will both our judgments join,10
Well my lord:,10
And 'scape detecting I will pay the theft.,10
Get you a place.,10
How fares our cousin Hamlet?,10
the air promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.,10
are not mine.,10
To POLONIUS,10
That did I my lord; and was accounted a good actor.,10
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the,10
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf,10
Ay my lord; they stay upon your patience.,10
No good mother here's metal more attractive.,10
Lady shall I lie in your lap?,10
No my lord.,10
Ay my lord.,10
I think nothing my lord.,10
What is my lord?,10
You are merry my lord.,10
Ay my lord.,10
but be merry? for look you how cheerfully my,10
Nay 'tis twice two months my lord.,10
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two,10
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half,10
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on with,10
the hobby-horse is forgot.',10
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen  embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes  show of protestation unto him. He takes her up  and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down  upon a bank of flowers: she seeing him asleep  leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow takes off his  crown kisses it and pours poison in the King's  ears and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King  dead and makes passionate action. The Poisoner  with some two or three Mutes comes in again  seeming to lament with her. The dead body is  carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with  gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts his love,10
What means this my lord?,10
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.,10
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot,10
Will he tell us what this show meant?,10
ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means.,10
For us and for our tragedy,10
We beg your hearing patiently.,10
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?,10
As woman's love.,10
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round,10
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen,10
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands,10
So many journeys may the sun and moon,10
But woe is me you are so sick of late,10
That I distrust you. Yet though I distrust,10
For women's fear and love holds quantity;,10
Now what my love is proof hath made you know;,10
Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear;,10
Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too;,10
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,10
For husband shalt thou--,10
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:,10
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.,10
The instances that second marriage move,10
A second time I kill my husband dead,10
I do believe you think what now you speak;,10
Purpose is but the slave to memory,10
Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree;,10
Most necessary 'tis that we forget,10
What to ourselves in passion we propose,10
The violence of either grief or joy,10
Where joy most revels grief doth most lament;,10
This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange,10
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,10
The great man down you mark his favourite flies;,10
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;,10
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,10
But orderly to end where I begun,10
That our devices still are overthrown;,10
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;,10
Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light!,10
To desperation turn my trust and hope!,10
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy,10
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,10
If she should break it now!,10
My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile,10
Sleeps,10
And never come mischance between us twain!,10
Madam how like you this play?,10
O but she'll keep her word.,10
No no they do but jest poison in jest; no offence,10
What do you call the play?,10
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is,10
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o',10
touches us not: let the galled jade wince our,10
Enter LUCIANUS,10
You are as good as a chorus my lord.,10
could see the puppets dallying.,10
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.,10
So you must take your husbands. Begin murderer;,10
the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.',10
Confederate season else no creature seeing;,10
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted thrice infected,10
On wholesome life usurp immediately.,10
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His,10
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer,10
The king rises.,10
How fares my lord?,10
Give me some light: away!,10
Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO,10
The hart ungalled play;,10
So runs the world away.,10
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two,10
fellowship in a cry of players sir?,10
A whole one I.,10
This realm dismantled was,10
A very very--pajock.,10
O good Horatio I'll take the ghost's word for a,10
Very well my lord.,10
I did very well note him.,10
For if the king like not the comedy,10
Come some music!,10
Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you.,10
The king sir--,10
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.,10
No my lord rather with choler.,10
signify this to his doctor; for for me to put him,10
more choler.,10
start not so wildly from my affair.,10
The queen your mother in most great affliction of,10
You are welcome.,10
breed. If it shall please you to make me a,10
commandment: if not your pardon and my return,10
Sir I cannot.,10
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,10
or rather as you say my mother: therefore no,10
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her,10
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother! But,10
admiration? Impart.,10
go to bed.,10
you any further trade with us?,10
So I do still by these pickers and stealers.,10
do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if,10
Sir I lack advancement.,10
himself for your succession in Denmark?,10
is something musty.,10
O the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with,10
as if you would drive me into a toil?,10
unmannerly.,10
this pipe?,10
I pray you.,10
I do beseech you.,10
Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with,10
mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music.,10
But these cannot I command to any utterance of,10
Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of,10
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my,10
the top of my compass: and there is much music,10
you make it speak. 'Sblood do you think I am,10
instrument you will though you can fret me yet you,10
Enter POLONIUS,10
My lord the queen would speak with you and,10
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?,10
Methinks it is like a weasel.,10
Or like a whale?,10
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool,10
I will say so.,10
Exit POLONIUS,10
Exeunt all but HAMLET,10
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out,10
And do such bitter business as the day,10
O heart lose not thy nature; let not ever,10
Let me be cruel not unnatural:,10
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;,10
To give them seals never my soul consent!,10
SCENE III. A room in the castle.,10
I like him not nor stands it safe with us,10
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,10
The terms of our estate may not endure,10
Out of his lunacies.,10
Most holy and religious fear it is,10
That live and feed upon your majesty.,10
With all the strength and armour of the mind,10
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest,10
Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw,10
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,10
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which when it falls,10
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone,10
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage;,10
Which now goes too free-footed.,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
My lord he's going to his mother's closet:,10
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:,10
Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,10
The speech of vantage. Fare you well my liege:,10
And tell you what I know.,10
Exit POLONIUS,10
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,10
Though inclination be as sharp as will:,10
And like a man to double business bound,10
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand,10
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens,10
But to confront the visage of offence?,10
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,10
My fault is past. But O what form of prayer,10
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd,10
My crown mine own ambition and my queen.,10
In the corrupted currents of this world,10
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself,10
There is no shuffling there the action lies,10
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,10
Try what repentance can: what can it not?,10
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!,10
Art more engaged! Help angels! Make assay!,10
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!,10
Retires and kneels,10
Now might I do it pat now he is praying;,10
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:,10
I his sole son do this same villain send,10
O this is hire and salary not revenge.,10
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May;,10
But in our circumstance and course of thought,10
To take him in the purging of his soul,10
No!,10
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage,10
At gaming swearing or about some act,10
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven,10
As hell whereto it goes. My mother stays:,10
Exit,10
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.,10
SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.,10
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:,10
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between,10
Pray you be round with him.,10
I'll warrant you,10
POLONIUS hides behind the arras,10
Now mother what's the matter?,10
Mother you have my father much offended.,10
Go go you question with a wicked tongue.,10
What's the matter now?,10
No by the rood not so:,10
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.,10
Come come and sit you down; you shall not budge;,10
Where you may see the inmost part of you.,10
Help help ho!,10
[Drawing]  How now! a rat? Dead for a ducat dead!,10
[Behind]  O I am slain!,10
O me what hast thou done?,10
Is it the king?,10
A bloody deed! almost as bad good mother,10
As kill a king!,10
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS,10
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;,10
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,10
If it be made of penetrable stuff,10
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.,10
In noise so rude against me?,10
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,10
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,10
As false as dicers' oaths: O such a deed,10
The very soul and sweet religion makes,10
Yea this solidity and compound mass,10
Is thought-sick at the act.,10
That roars so loud and thunders in the index?,10
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.,10
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;,10
A station like the herald Mercury,10
A combination and a form indeed,10
To give the world assurance of a man:,10
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,10
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,10
You cannot call it love; for at your age,10
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment,10
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense,10
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd,10
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't,10
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight,10
Or but a sickly part of one true sense,10
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,10
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,10
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,10
And reason panders will.,10
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;,10
As will not leave their tinct.,10
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,10
Over the nasty sty--,10
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;,10
A murderer and a villain;,10
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;,10
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,10
No more!,10
Enter Ghost,10
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?,10
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,10
The important acting of your dread command? O say!,10
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.,10
O step between her and her fighting soul:,10
Speak to her Hamlet.,10
Alas how is't with you,10
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?,10
And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,10
Starts up and stands on end. O gentle son,10
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?,10
His form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones,10
Lest with this piteous action you convert,10
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.,10
Do you see nothing there?,10
Nor did you nothing hear?,10
Why look you there! look how it steals away!,10
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!,10
This the very coinage of your brain:,10
Is very cunning in.,10
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,10
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,10
Would gambol from. Mother for love of grace,10
That not your trespass but my madness speaks:,10
Whilst rank corruption mining all within,10
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;,10
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;,10
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,10
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain.,10
And live the purer with the other half.,10
Assume a virtue if you have it not.,10
Of habits devil is angel yet in this,10
He likewise gives a frock or livery,10
And that shall lend a kind of easiness,10
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,10
With wondrous potency. Once more good night:,10
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,10
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,10
That I must be their scourge and minister.,10
The death I gave him. So again good night.,10
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.,10
What shall I do?,10
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;,10
And let him for a pair of reechy kisses,10
Make you to ravel all this matter out,10
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;,10
Would from a paddock from a bat a gib,10
No in despite of sense and secrecy,10
Let the birds fly and like the famous ape,10
And break your own neck down.,10
And breath of life I have no life to breathe,10
I must to England; you know that?,10
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.,10
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,10
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;,10
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard,10
And blow them at the moon: O 'tis most sweet,10
This man shall set me packing:,10
Mother good night. Indeed this counsellor,10
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.,10
Good night mother.,10
ACT IV,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.,10
Bestow this place on us a little while.,10
Ah my good lord what have I seen to-night!,10
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend,10
Behind the arras hearing something stir,10
And in this brainish apprehension kills,10
O heavy deed!,10
His liberty is full of threats to all;,10
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?,10
Should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt,10
We would not understand what was most fit;,10
To keep it from divulging let it feed,10
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:,10
Among a mineral of metals base,10
O Gertrude come away!,10
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed,10
Both countenance and excuse. Ho Guildenstern!,10
Friends both go join you with some further aid:,10
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:,10
Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.,10
Come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends;,10
And what's untimely done. O come away!,10
Exeunt,10
Enter HAMLET,10

[Within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!,10
O here they come.,10
What have you done my lord with the dead body?,10
Tell us where 'tis that we may take it thence,10
Do not believe it.,10
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.,10
replication should be made by the son of a king?,10
Ay sir that soaks up the king's countenance his,10
king best service in the end: he keeps them like,10
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have,10
shall be dry again.,10
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a,10
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go,10
The body is with the king but the king is not with,10
A thing my lord!,10
Exeunt,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS attended,10
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!,10
He's loved of the distracted multitude,10
And where tis so the offender's scourge is weigh'd,10
This sudden sending him away must seem,10
By desperate appliance are relieved,10
Enter ROSENCRANTZ,10
Where the dead body is bestow'd my lord,10
But where is he?,10
Bring him before us.,10
Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN,10
At supper.,10
Not where he eats but where he is eaten: a certain,10
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all,10
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but,10
that's the end.,10
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a,10
What dost you mean by this?,10
progress through the guts of a beggar.,10
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger,10
yourself. But indeed if you find him not within,10
stairs into the lobby.,10
To some Attendants,10
Exeunt Attendants,10
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve,10
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;,10
The associates tend and every thing is bent,10
For England!,10
Good.,10
I see a cherub that sees them. But come; for,10
Thy loving father Hamlet.,10
and wife is one flesh; and so my mother. Come for England!,10
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;,10
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,10
After the Danish sword and thy free awe,10
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,10
The present death of Hamlet. Do it England;,10
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,10
Exit,10
Enter FORTINBRAS a Captain and Soldiers marching,10
Tell him that by his licence Fortinbras,10
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.,10
We shall express our duty in his eye;,10
I will do't my lord.,10
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers,10
Good sir whose powers are these?,10
How purposed sir I pray you?,10
Who commands them sir?,10
Goes it against the main of Poland sir,10
Truly to speak and with no addition,10
That hath in it no profit but the name.,10
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole,10
Why then the Polack never will defend it.,10
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats,10
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,10
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you sir.,10
Exit,10
I'll be with you straight go a little before.,10
How all occasions do inform against me,10
If his chief good and market of his time,10
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,10
That capability and god-like reason,10
Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple,10
A thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom,10
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;',10
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:,10
Led by a delicate and tender prince,10
Makes mouths at the invisible event,10
To all that fortune death and danger dare,10
Is not to stir without great argument,10
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,10
Excitements of my reason and my blood,10
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,10
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot,10
Which is not tomb enough and continent,10
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth!,10
SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.,10
I will not speak with her.,10
Her mood will needs be pitied.,10
She speaks much of her father; says she hears,10
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,10
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move,10
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;,10
yield them,10
Though nothing sure yet much unhappily.,10
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.,10
Exit HORATIO,10
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:,10
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.,10
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?,10
[Sings],10
From another one?,10
And his sandal shoon.,10
Say you? nay pray you mark.,10
He is dead and gone lady,10
At his head a grass-green turf,10
Nay but Ophelia--,10

Conceit upon her father.,10

To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,10
And I a maid at your window,10
Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,10
Let in the maid that out a maid,10
Pretty Ophelia!,10
Sings,10
Alack and fie for shame!,10
By cock they are to blame.,10
You promised me to wed.,10
An thou hadst not come to my bed.,10
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I,10
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:,10
coach! Good night ladies; good night sweet ladies;,10
Exit,10
I pray you.,10
O this is the poison of deep grief; it springs,10
When sorrows come they come not single spies,10
Next your son gone; and he most violent author,10
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,10
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia,10
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:,10
Her brother is in secret come from France;,10
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear,10
Wherein necessity of matter beggar'd,10
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude this,10
Gives me superfluous death.,10
Alack what noise is this?,10
Enter another Gentleman,10
Save yourself my lord:,10
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste,10
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;,10
Antiquity forgot custom not known,10
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:',10
Laertes shall be king Laertes king!',10
O this is counter you false Danish dogs!,10
Noise within,10
Where is this king? Sirs stand you all without.,10
I pray you give me leave.,10
They retire without the door,10
Give me my father!,10
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,10
Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow,10
What is the cause Laertes,10
Let him go Gertrude; do not fear our person:,10
That treason can but peep to what it would,10
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go Gertrude.,10
Where is my father?,10
But not by him.,10
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:,10
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit!,10
That both the worlds I give to negligence,10
Most thoroughly for my father.,10
My will not all the world:,10
They shall go far with little.,10
If you desire to know the certainty,10
That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,10
None but his enemies.,10
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;,10
Repast them with my blood.,10
Like a good child and a true gentleman.,10
And am most sensible in grief for it,10
As day does to your eye.,10
How now! what noise is that?,10
O heat dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,10
By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight,10
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia!,10
Should be as moral as an old man's life?,10
It sends some precious instance of itself,10
[Sings],10
Hey non nonny nonny hey nonny;,10
Fare you well my dove!,10
It could not move thus.,10
You must sing a-down a-down,10
O how the wheel becomes it! It is the false,10
This nothing's more than matter.,10
love remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.,10
There's fennel for you and columbines: there's rue,10
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with,10
some violets but they withered all when my father,10
Sings,10
Thought and affliction passion hell itself,10
[Sings],10
And will he not come again?,10
Go to thy death-bed:,10
His beard was as white as snow,10
He is gone he is gone,10
God ha' mercy on his soul!,10
Exit,10
Laertes I must commune with your grief,10
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.,10
If by direct or by collateral hand,10
Our crown our life and all that we can ours,10
Be you content to lend your patience to us,10
To give it due content.,10
His means of death his obscure funeral--,10
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--,10
That I must call't in question.,10
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.,10
Exeunt,10
Enter HORATIO and a Servant,10
Sailors sir: they say they have letters for you.,10
Exit Servant,10
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet.,10
God bless you sir.,10
He shall sir an't please him. There's a letter for,10
bound for England; if your name be Horatio as I am,10
[Reads]  'Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked,10
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old,10
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on,10
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so,10
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they,10
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me,10
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee,10
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee,10
course for England: of them I have much to tell,10
He that thou knowest thine HAMLET.',10
And do't the speedier that you may direct me,10
Exeunt,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES,10
And you must put me in your heart for friend,10
That he which hath your noble father slain,10
It well appears: but tell me,10
So crimeful and so capital in nature,10
You mainly were stirr'd up.,10
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd,10
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--,10
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,10
I could not but by her. The other motive,10
Is the great love the general gender bear him;,10
Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,10
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,10
And not where I had aim'd them.,10
A sister driven into desperate terms,10
Stood challenger on mount of all the age,10
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think,10
That we can let our beard be shook with danger,10
I loved your father and we love ourself;,10
Enter a Messenger,10
Letters my lord from Hamlet:,10
From Hamlet! who brought them?,10
They were given me by Claudio; he received them,10
Laertes you shall hear them. Leave us.,10
Reads,10
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see,10
pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden,10
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?,10
Know you the hand?,10
And in a postscript here he says 'alone.',10
I'm lost in it my lord. But let him come;,10
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,10
If it be so Laertes--,10
Will you be ruled by me?,10
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.,10
As checking at his voyage and that he means,10
To an exploit now ripe in my device,10
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,10
And call it accident.,10
The rather if you could devise it so,10
It falls right.,10
And that in Hamlet's hearing for a quality,10
Did not together pluck such envy from him,10
Of the unworthiest siege.,10
A very riband in the cap of youth,10
The light and careless livery that it wears,10
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,10
I've seen myself and served against the French,10
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;,10
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured,10
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,10
A Norman was't?,10
Upon my life Lamond.,10
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed,10
He made confession of you,10
For art and exercise in your defence,10
That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed,10
He swore had had neither motion guard nor eye,10
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy,10
Your sudden coming o'er to play with him.,10
What out of this my lord?,10
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,10
Why ask you this?,10
But that I know love is begun by time;,10
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.,10
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;,10
For goodness growing to a plurisy,10
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,10
As there are tongues are hands are accidents;,10
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--,10
To show yourself your father's son in deed,10
To cut his throat i' the church.,10
Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,10
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:,10
And set a double varnish on the fame,10
And wager on your heads: he being remiss,10
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,10
A sword unbated and in a pass of practise,10
I will do't:,10
I bought an unction of a mountebank,10
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,10
Under the moon can save the thing from death,10
With this contagion that if I gall him slightly,10
Let's further think of this;,10
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,10
Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project,10
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:,10
When in your motion you are hot and dry--,10
And that he calls for drink I'll have prepared him,10
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,10
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE,10
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,10
Drown'd! O where?,10
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;,10
Of crow-flowers nettles daisies and long purples,10
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:,10
Clambering to hang an envious sliver broke;,10
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;,10
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;,10
Or like a creature native and indued,10
Till that her garments heavy with their drink,10
To muddy death.,10
Drown'd drown'd.,10
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet,10
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,10
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,10
Exit,10
How much I had to do to calm his rage!,10
Therefore let's follow.,10
ACT V,10
Enter two Clowns with spades  and c,10
wilfully seeks her own salvation?,10
straight: the crowner hath sat on her and finds it,10
How can that be unless she drowned herself in her,10
Why 'tis found so.,10
here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,10
is to act to do to perform: argal she drowned,10
Nay but hear you goodman delver--,10
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,10
goes--mark you that; but if the water come to him,10
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.,10
Ay marry is't; crowner's quest law.,10
a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o',10
Why there thou say'st: and the more pity that,10
drown or hang themselves more than their even,10
gentleman but gardeners ditchers and grave-makers:,10
Was he a gentleman?,10
Why he had none.,10
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:',10
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the,10
Go to.,10
mason the shipwright or the carpenter?,10
thousand tenants.,10
does well; but how does it well? it does well to,10
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,10
Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or,10
Ay tell me that and unyoke.,10
To't.,10
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO at a distance,10
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when,10
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till,10
stoup of liquor.,10
He digs and sings,10
Methought it was very sweet,10
O methought there was nothing meet.,10
sings at grave-making?,10
Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath,10
[Sings],10
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,10
As if I had never been such.,10
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once:,10
Cain's jaw-bone that did the first murder! It,10
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,10
It might my lord.,10
sweet lord! How dost thou good lord?' This might,10
such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it; might it not?,10
Why e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless and,10
here's fine revolution an we had the trick to,10
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.,10
A pick-axe and a spade a spade,10
O a pit of clay for to be made,10
Throws up another skull,10
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now his quillets,10
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the,10
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be,10
his recognizances his fines his double vouchers,10
the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine,10
no more of his purchases and double ones too than,10
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in,10
Not a jot more my lord.,10
Ay my lord and of calf-skins too.,10
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose,10
Mine sir.,10
O a pit of clay for to be made,10
I think it be thine indeed; for thou liest in't.,10
yours: for my part I do not lie in't and yet it is mine.,10
tis for the dead not for the quick; therefore thou liest.,10
you.,10
For no man sir.,10
For none neither.,10
One that was a woman sir; but rest her soul she's dead.,10
card or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,10
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the,10
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a,10
Of all the days i' the year I came to't that day,10
How long is that since?,10
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that,10
Ay marry why was he sent into England?,10
there; or if he do not it's no great matter there.,10
Twill a not be seen in him there; there the men,10
How came he mad?,10
How strangely?,10
Upon what ground?,10
and boy thirty years.,10
I' faith if he be not rotten before he die--as we,10
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year,10
Why he more than another?,10
he will keep out water a great while; and your water,10
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth,10
Whose was it?,10
Nay I know not.,10
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,10
This?,10
Let me see.,10
Alas poor Yorick! I knew him Horatio: a fellow,10
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now how,10
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know,10
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,10
now to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?,10
her paint an inch thick to this favour she must,10
me one thing.,10
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i',10
E'en so.,10
Puts down the skull,10
To what base uses we may return Horatio! Why may,10
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?,10
No faith not a jot; but to follow him thither with,10
thus: Alexander died Alexander was buried,10
earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he,10
Imperious Caesar dead and turn'd to clay,10
O that that earth which kept the world in awe,10
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.,10
The queen the courtiers: who is this they follow?,10
The corse they follow did with desperate hand,10
Couch we awhile and mark.,10
What ceremony else?,10
A very noble youth: mark.,10
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged,10
And but that great command o'ersways the order,10
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,10
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,10
Of bell and burial.,10
No more be done:,10
To sing a requiem and such rest to her,10
Lay her i' the earth:,10
May violets spring! I tell thee churlish priest,10
When thou liest howling.,10
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!,10
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;,10
And not have strew'd thy grave.,10
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,10
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,10
Leaps into the grave,10
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,10
Of blue Olympus.,10
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow,10
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,10
Leaps into the grave,10
Grappling with him,10
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;,10
Yet have I something in me dangerous,10
Pluck them asunder.,10
Gentlemen--,10
The Attendants part them and they come out of the grave,10
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.,10
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers,10
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?,10
For love of God forbear him.,10
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?,10
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?,10
Be buried quick with her and so will I:,10
Millions of acres on us till our ground,10
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay an thou'lt mouth,10
This is mere madness:,10
Anon as patient as the female dove,10
His silence will sit drooping.,10
What is the reason that you use me thus?,10
Let Hercules himself do what he may,10
Exit,10
Exit HORATIO,10
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;,10
Good Gertrude set some watch over your son.,10
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;,10
Exeunt,10
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO,10
You do remember all the circumstance?,10
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting,10
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,10
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,10
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,10
That is most certain.,10
My sea-gown scarf'd about me in the dark,10
Finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew,10
My fears forgetting manners to unseal,10
O royal knavery!--an exact command,10
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,10
That on the supervise no leisure bated,10
My head should be struck off.,10
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.,10
I beseech you.,10
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,10
Devised a new commission wrote it fair:,10
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much,10
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know,10
Ay good my lord.,10
As England was his faithful tributary,10
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear,10
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,10
Without debatement further more or less,10
Not shriving-time allow'd.,10
Why even in that was heaven ordinant.,10
Which was the model of that Danish seal;,10
Subscribed it gave't the impression placed it safely,10
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent,10
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.,10
They are not near my conscience; their defeat,10
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes,10
Of mighty opposites.,10
Does it not think'st thee stand me now upon--,10
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,10
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,10
To let this canker of our nature come,10
It must be shortly known to him from England,10
It will be short: the interim is mine;,10
But I am very sorry good Horatio,10
For by the image of my cause I see,10
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me,10
Peace! who comes here?,10
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.,10
No my good lord.,10
know him. He hath much land and fertile: let a,10
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but as I say,10
Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I,10
I will receive it sir with all diligence of,10
I thank your lordship it is very hot.,10
northerly.,10
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my,10
Exceedingly my lord; it is very sultry--as,10
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a,10
I beseech you remember--,10
Nay good my lord; for mine ease in good faith.,10
me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent,10
indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or,10
continent of what part a gentleman would see.,10
though I know to divide him inventorially would,10
neither in respect of his quick sail. But in the,10
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and,10
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace,10
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.,10
in our more rawer breath?,10
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?,10
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?,10
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.,10
I know you are not ignorant--,10
it would not much approve me. Well sir?,10
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with,10
know himself.,10
laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed.,10
Rapier and dagger.,10
The king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary,10
it six French rapiers and poniards with their,10
carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very,10
and of very liberal conceit.,10
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.,10
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we,10
be hangers till then. But on: six Barbary horses,10
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet,10
The king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes,10
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it,10
would vouchsafe the answer.,10
I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial.,10
majesty 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let,10
king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can;,10
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?,10
I commend my duty to your lordship.,10
Exit OSRIC,10
tongues else for's turn.,10
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it.,10
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of,10
yesty collection which carries them through and,10
but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out.,10
My lord his majesty commended him to you by young,10
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to,10
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's,10
or whensoever provided I be so able as now.,10
In happy time.,10
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.,10
Exit Lord,10
I do not think so: since he went into France I,10
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here,10
Nay good my lord--,10
gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.,10
forestall their repair hither and say you are not,10
Not a whit we defy augury: there's a special,10
tis not to come; if it be not to come it will be,10
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE LAERTES Lords OSRIC and Attendants with foils  and c,10
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's,10
But pardon't as you are a gentleman.,10
And you must needs have heard how I am punish'd,10
That might your nature honour and exception,10
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:,10
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,10
Who does it then? His madness: if't be so,10
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.,10
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil,10
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,10
I am satisfied in nature,10
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour,10
Till by some elder masters of known honour,10
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,10
And will not wrong it.,10
And will this brother's wager frankly play.,10
Come one for me.,10
Your skill shall like a star i' the darkest night,10
You mock me sir.,10
Give them the foils young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,10
Very well my lord,10
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:,10
This is too heavy let me see another.,10
They prepare to play,10
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.,10
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,10
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;,10
Richer than that which four successive kings,10
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,10
The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth,10
And you the judges bear a wary eye.,10
Come my lord.,10
One.,10
Judgment.,10
Well; again.,10
Here's to thy health.,10
Give him the cup.,10
They play,10
A touch a touch I do confess.,10
He's fat and scant of breath.,10
The queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet.,10
Gertrude do not drink.,10
[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.,10
Come let me wipe thy face.,10
I do not think't.,10
Come for the third Laertes: you but dally;,10
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.,10
They play,10
Have at you now!,10
Part them; they are incensed.,10
QUEEN GERTRUDE falls,10
They bleed on both sides. How is it my lord?,10
Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric;,10
How does the queen?,10
No no the drink the drink--O my dear Hamlet--,10
Dies,10
Treachery! Seek it out.,10
No medicine in the world can do thee good;,10
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,10
Hath turn'd itself on me lo here I lie,10
I can no more: the king the king's to blame.,10
Then venom to thy work.,10
Treason! treason!,10
Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane,10
Follow my mother.,10
He is justly served;,10
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet:,10
Nor thine on me.,10
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.,10
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,10
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant death,10
But let it be. Horatio I am dead;,10
To the unsatisfied.,10
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:,10
As thou'rt a man,10
O good Horatio what a wounded name,10
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,10
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,10
March afar off and shot within,10
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland,10
This warlike volley.,10
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:,10
But I do prophesy the election lights,10
So tell him with the occurrents more and less,10
Dies,10
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!,10
March within,10
Where is this sight?,10
If aught of woe or wonder cease your search.,10
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,10
So bloodily hast struck?,10
And our affairs from England come too late:,10
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,10
Where should we have our thanks?,10
Had it the ability of life to thank you:,10
But since so jump upon this bloody question,10
Are here arrived give order that these bodies,10
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world,10
Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts,10
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,10
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I,10
Let us haste to hear it,10
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune:,10
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.,10
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;,10
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance,10
Let four captains,10
For he was likely had he been put on,10
The soldiers' music and the rites of war,10
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this,10
Go bid the soldiers shoot.,10
ACT I,11
Enter Chorus,11
The brightest heaven of invention,11
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!,11
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,11
Crouch for employment. But pardon and gentles all,11
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth,11
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram,11
That did affright the air at Agincourt?,11
Attest in little place a million;,11
On your imaginary forces work.,11
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,11
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:,11
Into a thousand parts divide on man,11
Think when we talk of horses that you see them,11
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,11
Turning the accomplishment of many years,11
Admit me Chorus to this history;,11
Gently to hear kindly to judge our play.,11
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.,11
My lord I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,11
Was like and had indeed against us pass'd,11
Did push it out of farther question.,11
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,11
For all the temporal lands which men devout,11
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:,11
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,11
And to relief of lazars and weak age,11
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;,11
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.,11
Twould drink the cup and all.,11
The king is full of grace and fair regard.,11
The courses of his youth promised it not.,11
But that his wildness mortified in him,11
Consideration like an angel came,11
Leaving his body as a paradise,11
Never was such a sudden scholar made;,11
With such a heady currance scouring faults,11
So soon did lose his seat and all at once,11
We are blessed in the change.,11
And all-admiring with an inward wish,11
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,11
List his discourse of war and you shall hear,11
Turn him to any cause of policy,11
Familiar as his garter: that when he speaks,11
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,11
So that the art and practic part of life,11
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,11
His companies unletter'd rude and shallow,11
And never noted in him any study,11
From open haunts and popularity.,11
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best,11
And so the prince obscured his contemplation,11
Grew like the summer grass fastest by night,11
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;,11
How things are perfected.,11
How now for mitigation of this bill,11
Incline to it or no?,11
Or rather swaying more upon our part,11
For I have made an offer to his majesty,11
And in regard of causes now in hand,11
As touching France to give a greater sum,11
Did to his predecessors part withal.,11
With good acceptance of his majesty;,11
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,11
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,11
Derived from Edward his great-grandfather.,11
The French ambassador upon that instant,11
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?,11
Then go we in to know his embassy;,11
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.,11
Exeunt,11
Enter KING HENRY V GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK WESTMORELAND and Attendants,11
Not here in presence.,11
Shall we call in the ambassador my liege?,11
Before we hear him of some things of weight,11
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP of ELY,11
And make you long become it!,11
My learned lord we pray you to proceed,11
Why the law Salique that they have in France,11
And God forbid my dear and faithful lord,11
Or nicely charge your understanding soul,11
Suits not in native colours with the truth;,11
Shall drop their blood in approbation,11
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,11
We charge you in the name of God take heed;,11
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops,11
Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords,11
Under this conjuration speak my lord;,11
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd,11
Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers,11
To this imperial throne. There is no bar,11
But this which they produce from Pharamond,11
No woman shall succeed in Salique land:',11
To be the realm of France and Pharamond,11
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm,11
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;,11
There left behind and settled certain French;,11
For some dishonest manners of their life,11
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:,11
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.,11
Was not devised for the realm of France:,11
Until four hundred one and twenty years,11
Idly supposed the founder of this law;,11
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great,11
Beyond the river Sala in the year,11
King Pepin which deposed Childeric,11
Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair,11
Hugh Capet also who usurped the crown,11
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,11
Through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,11
Daughter to Charlemain who was the son,11
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,11
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,11
That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother,11
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:,11
Was re-united to the crown of France.,11
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,11
To hold in right and title of the female:,11
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law,11
And rather choose to hide them in a net,11
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.,11
The sin upon my head dread sovereign!,11
When the man dies let the inheritance,11
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;,11
Go my dread lord to your great-grandsire's tomb,11
And your great-uncle's Edward the Black Prince,11
Making defeat on the full power of France,11
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp,11
O noble English. that could entertain,11
And let another half stand laughing by,11
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,11
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;,11
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege,11
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.,11
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,11
They know your grace hath cause and means and might;,11
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,11
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.,11
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;,11
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum,11
Bring in to any of your ancestors.,11
But lay down our proportions to defend,11
With all advantages.,11
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend,11
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,11
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;,11
Never went with his forces into France,11
Came pouring like the tide into a breach,11
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,11
That England being empty of defence,11
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege;,11
When all her chivalry hath been in France,11
She hath herself not only well defended,11
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,11
And make her chronicle as rich with praise,11
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.,11
If that you will France win,11
For once the eagle England being in prey,11
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,11
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.,11
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,11
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.,11
The advised head defends itself at home;,11
Put into parts doth keep in one consent,11
Like music.,11
The state of man in divers functions,11
To which is fixed as an aim or butt,11
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach,11
They have a king and officers of sorts;,11
Others like merchants venture trade abroad,11
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,11
To the tent-royal of their emperor;,11
The singing masons building roofs of gold,11
The poor mechanic porters crowding in,11
The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum,11
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,11
To one consent may work contrariously:,11
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;,11
As many lines close in the dial's centre;,11
End in one purpose and be all well borne,11
Divide your happy England into four;,11
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.,11
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,11
The name of hardiness and policy.,11
Exeunt some Attendants,11
And yours the noble sinews of our power,11
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,11
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,11
Tombless with no remembrance over them:,11
Speak freely of our acts or else our grave,11
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.,11
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure,11
Your greeting is from him not from the king.,11
Freely to render what we have in charge;,11
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?,11
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject,11
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness,11
Thus then in few.,11
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right,11
In answer of which claim the prince our master,11
And bids you be advised there's nought in France,11
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.,11
This tun of treasure; and in lieu of this,11
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.,11
Tennis-balls my liege.,11
His present and your pains we thank you for:,11
We will in France by God's grace play a set,11
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler,11
With chaces. And we understand him well,11
Not measuring what use we made of them.,11
And therefore living hence did give ourself,11
That men are merriest when they are from home.,11
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness,11
For that I have laid by my majesty,11
But I will rise there with so full a glory,11
Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.,11
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul,11
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows,11
Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down;,11
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.,11
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name,11
To venge me as I may and to put forth,11
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin,11
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.,11
Exeunt Ambassadors,11
We hope to make the sender blush at it.,11
That may give furtherance to our expedition;,11
Save those to God that run before our business.,11
Be soon collected and all things thought upon,11
More feathers to our wings; for God before,11
Therefore let every man now task his thought,11
Exeunt. Flourish,11
PROLOGUE,11
Now all the youth of England are on fire,11
Now thrive the armourers and honour's thought,11
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,11
With winged heels as English Mercuries.,11
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point,11
Promised to Harry and his followers.,11
Of this most dreadful preparation,11
Seek to divert the English purposes.,11
Like little body with a mighty heart,11
Were all thy children kind and natural!,11
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills,11
One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second,11
Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland,11
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;,11
If hell and treason hold their promises,11
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest,11
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;,11
Is now transported gentles to Southampton;,11
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,11
To give you gentle pass; for if we may,11
But till the king come forth and not till then,11
Exit,11
Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH,11
Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolph.,11
For my part I care not: I say little; but when,11
shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will,11
what though? it will toast cheese and it will,11
there's an end.,11
we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it,11
Faith I will live so long as I may that's the,11
will do as I may: that is my rest that is the,11
It is certain corporal that he is married to Nell,11
were troth-plight to her.,11
sleep and they may have their throats about them at,11
be as it may: though patience be a tired mare yet,11
cannot tell.,11
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good,11
Base tike call'st thou me host? Now by this hand,11
No by my troth not long; for we cannot lodge and,11
honestly by the prick of their needles but it will,11
NYM and PISTOL draw,11
shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.,11
Pish!,11
Good Corporal Nym show thy valour and put up your sword.,11
Solus' egregious dog? O viper vile!,11
The 'solus' in thy teeth and in thy throat,11
And which is worse within thy nasty mouth!,11
For I can take and Pistol's cock is up,11
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an,11
foul with me Pistol I will scour you with my,11
off I would prick your guts a little in good,11
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!,11
Therefore exhale.,11
first stroke I'll run him up to the hilts as I am a soldier.,11
An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.,11
Thy spirits are most tall.,11
terms: that is the humour of it.,11
That is the word. I thee defy again.,11
No; to the spital go,11
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,11
I have and I will hold the quondam Quickly,11
Enter the Boy,11
you hostess: he is very sick and would to bed.,11
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith he's very ill.,11
By my troth he'll yield the crow a pudding one of,11
husband come home presently.,11
Come shall I make you two friends? We must to,11
knives to cut one another's throats?,11
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?,11
That now I will have: that's the humour of it.,11
They draw,11
kill him; by this sword I will.,11
Corporal Nym an thou wilt be friends be friends:,11
Prithee put up.,11
A noble shalt thou have and present pay;,11
And friendship shall combine and brotherhood:,11
Is not this just? for I shall sutler be,11
Give me thy hand.,11
In cash most justly paid.,11
Re-enter Hostess,11
John. Ah poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning,11
behold. Sweet men come to him.,11
the even of it.,11
His heart is fracted and corroborate.,11
he passes some humours and careers.,11
SCENE II. Southampton. A council-chamber.,11
Fore God his grace is bold to trust these traitors.,11
How smooth and even they do bear themselves!,11
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.,11
By interception which they dream not of.,11
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,11
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.,11
Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard.,11
And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts:,11
Will cut their passage through the force of France,11
For which we have in head assembled them?,11
I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded,11
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,11
Success and conquest to attend on us.,11
Than is your majesty: there's not I think a subject,11
Under the sweet shade of your government.,11
Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you,11
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;,11
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit,11
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,11
To do your grace incessant services.,11
Enlarge the man committed yesterday,11
it was excess of wine that set him on;,11
That's mercy but too much security:,11
Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind.,11
So may your highness and yet punish too.,11
You show great mercy if you give him life,11
Alas your too much love and care of me,11
If little faults proceeding on distemper,11
When capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested,11
Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care,11
Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:,11
I one my lord:,11
So did you me my liege.,11
Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours;,11
Grey of Northumberland this same is yours:,11
My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter,11
What see you in those papers that you lose,11
Their cheeks are paper. Why what read you there,11
Out of appearance?,11
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.,11
The mercy that was quick in us but late,11
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy;,11
As dogs upon their masters worrying you.,11
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,11
To furnish him with all appertinents,11
Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired,11
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which,11
Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn. But O,11
Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature!,11
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,11
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,11
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil,11
That though the truth of it stands off as gross,11
Treason and murder ever kept together,11
Working so grossly in a natural cause,11
But thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in,11
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was,11
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:,11
Do botch and bungle up damnation,11
From glistering semblances of piety;,11
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,11
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus,11
He might return to vasty Tartar back,11
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.',11
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?,11
Why so didst thou: come they of noble family?,11
Why so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,11
Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood,11
Not working with the eye without the ear,11
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:,11
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued,11
For this revolt of thine methinks is like,11
Arrest them to the answer of the law;,11
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of,11
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of,11
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of,11
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;,11
Which I beseech your highness to forgive,11
For me the gold of France did not seduce;,11
The sooner to effect what I intended:,11
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,11
Never did faithful subject more rejoice,11
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.,11
My fault but not my body pardon sovereign.,11
You have conspired against our royal person,11
Received the golden earnest of our death;,11
His princes and his peers to servitude,11
And his whole kingdom into desolation.,11
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,11
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,11
The taste whereof God of his mercy give,11
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.,11
Now lords for France; the enterprise whereof,11
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,11
This dangerous treason lurking in our way,11
But every rub is smoothed on our way.,11
Our puissance into the hand of God,11
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:,11
Exeunt,11
Enter PISTOL Hostess NYM BARDOLPH and Boy,11
No; for my manly heart doth yearn.,11
Boy bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,11
Would I were with him wheresome'er he is either in,11
Nay sure he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's,11
a finer end and went away an it had been any,11
and one even at the turning o' the tide: for after,11
flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends I knew,11
a pen and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,11
cheer.' So a' cried out 'God God God!' three or,11
should not think of God; I hoped there was no need,11
a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my,11
cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees and,11
upward and all was as cold as any stone.,11
Ay that a' did.,11
Nay that a' did not.,11
incarnate.,11
never liked.,11
A' did in some sort indeed handle women; but then,11
Do you not remember a' saw a flea stick upon,11
burning in hell-fire?,11
that's all the riches I got in his service.,11
Southampton.,11
Look to my chattels and my movables:,11
Trust none;,11
And hold-fast is the only dog my duck:,11
Go clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,11
To suck to suck the very blood to suck!,11
Touch her soft mouth and march.,11
Kissing her,11
Let housewifery appear: keep close I thee command.,11
Exeunt,11
Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE the Constable and others,11
And more than carefully it us concerns,11
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,11
And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch,11
With men of courage and with means defendant;,11
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.,11
As fear may teach us out of late examples,11
Upon our fields.,11
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;,11
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,11
Should be maintain'd assembled and collected,11
Therefore I say 'tis meet we all go forth,11
And let us do it with no show of fear;,11
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:,11
Her sceptre so fantastically borne,11
That fear attends her not.,11
You are too much mistaken in this king:,11
With what great state he heard their embassy,11
How modest in exception and withal,11
And you shall find his vanities forespent,11
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;,11
That shall first spring and be most delicate.,11
But though we think it so it is no matter:,11
The enemy more mighty than he seems:,11
Which of a weak or niggardly projection,11
A little cloth.,11
And princes look you strongly arm to meet him.,11
And he is bred out of that bloody strain,11
Witness our too much memorable shame,11
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand,11
Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing,11
Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him,11
The patterns that by God and by French fathers,11
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear,11
Enter a Messenger,11
Do crave admittance to your majesty.,11
Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords,11
Turn head and stop pursuit; for coward dogs,11
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,11
Of what a monarchy you are the head:,11
As self-neglecting.,11
From our brother England?,11
He wills you in the name of God Almighty,11
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,11
To him and to his heirs; namely the crown,11
By custom and the ordinance of times,11
Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,11
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,11
In every branch truly demonstrative;,11
And when you find him evenly derived,11
Edward the Third he bids you then resign,11
From him the native and true challenger.,11
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown,11
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,11
That if requiring fail he will compel;,11
Deliver up the crown and to take mercy,11
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head,11
The dead men's blood the pining maidens groans,11
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.,11
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,11
For us we will consider of this further:,11
Back to our brother England.,11
I stand here for him: what to him from England?,11
And any thing that may not misbecome,11
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness,11
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,11
That caves and womby vaultages of France,11
In second accent of his ordnance.,11
It is against my will; for I desire,11
As matching to his youth and vanity,11
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,11
And be assured you'll find a difference,11
Between the promise of his greener days,11
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read,11
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.,11
Come here himself to question our delay;,11
You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:,11
To answer matters of this consequence.,11
ACT III,11
Enter Chorus,11
In motion of no less celerity,11
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier,11
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:,11
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;,11
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,11
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,11
You stand upon the ravage and behold,11
For so appears this fleet majestical,11
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,11
Guarded with grandsires babies and old women,11
For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd,11
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?,11
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,11
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;,11
Katharine his daughter and with her to dowry,11
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner,11
Alarum and chambers go off,11
And eke out our performance with your mind.,11
SCENE I. France. Before Harfleur.,11
Once more unto the breach dear friends once more;,11
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,11
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,11
Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood,11
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;,11
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it,11
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,11
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,11
To his full height. On on you noblest English.,11
Fathers that like so many Alexanders,11
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:,11
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.,11
And teach them how to war. And you good yeoman,11
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear,11
For there is none of you so mean and base,11
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,11
Follow your spirit and upon this charge,11
Exeunt. Alarum and chambers go off,11
Enter NYM BARDOLPH PISTOL and Boy,11
Pray thee corporal stay: the knocks are too hot;,11
the humour of it is too hot that is the very,11
The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:,11
And sword and shield,11
Doth win immortal fame.,11
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.,11
If wishes would prevail with me,11
But thither would I hie.,11
As bird doth sing on bough.,11
Up to the breach you dogs! avaunt you cullions!,11
Be merciful great duke to men of mould.,11
Abate thy rage great duke!,11
These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.,11
As young as I am I have observed these three,11
three though they would serve me could not be man,11
a man. For Bardolph he is white-livered and,11
fights not. For Pistol he hath a killing tongue,11
words and keeps whole weapons. For Nym he hath,11
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a',11
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never,11
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal,11
lute-case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for,11
brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a,11
men would carry coals. They would have me as,11
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,11
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I,11
their villany goes against my weak stomach and,11
Exit,11
Captain Fluellen you must come presently to the,11
To the mines! tell you the duke it is not so good,11
not according to the disciplines of the war: the,11
the athversary you may discuss unto the duke look,11
countermines: by Cheshu I think a' will plough up,11
The Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the,11
Irishman a very valiant gentleman i' faith.,11
I think it be.,11
verify as much in his beard: be has no more,11
you of the Roman disciplines than is a puppy-dog.,11
Here a' comes; and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with him.,11
that is certain; and of great expedition and,11
knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu he will,11
the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars,11
I say gud-day Captain Fluellen.,11
How now Captain Macmorris! have you quit the,11
By Chrish la! tish ill done: the work ish give,11
swear and my father's soul the work ish ill done;,11
Chrish save me la! in an hour: O tish ill done,11
Captain Macmorris I beseech you now will you,11
as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of,11
look you and friendly communication; partly to,11
look you of my mind as touching the direction of,11
It sall be vary gud gud feith gud captains bath:,11
occasion; that sall I marry.,11
day is hot and the weather and the wars and the,11
town is beseeched and the trumpet call us to the,11
tis shame for us all: so God sa' me 'tis shame to,11
throats to be cut and works to be done; and there,11
By the mess ere theise eyes of mine take themselves,11
the grund for it; ay or go to death; and ay'll pay,11
that is the breff and the long. Marry I wad full,11
Captain Macmorris I think look you under your,11
Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,11
my nation? Who talks of my nation?,11
meant Captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think,11
discretion you ought to use me look you: being as,11
war and in the derivation of my birth and in,11
I do not know you so good a man as myself: so,11
Gentlemen both you will mistake each other.,11
A parley sounded,11
Captain Macmorris when there is more better,11
bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;,11
Exeunt,11
The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train,11
This is the latest parle we will admit;,11
Or like to men proud of destruction,11
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,11
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur,11
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,11
In liberty of bloody hand shall range,11
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.,11
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,11
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?,11
If your pure maidens fall into the hand,11
What rein can hold licentious wickedness,11
We may as bootless spend our vain command,11
As send precepts to the leviathan,11
Take pity of your town and of your people,11
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace,11
Of heady murder spoil and villany.,11
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand,11
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,11
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,11
Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry,11
What say you? will you yield and this avoid,11
Our expectation hath this day an end:,11
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready,11
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.,11
For we no longer are defensible.,11
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,11
Use mercy to them all. For us dear uncle,11
Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais.,11
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.,11
SCENE IV. The FRENCH KING's palace.,11
Alice tu as ete en Angleterre et tu parles bien le langage.,11
Je te prie m'enseignez: il faut que j'apprenne a,11
La main? elle est appelee de hand.,11
Les doigts? ma foi j'oublie les doigts; mais je me,11
appeles de fingres; oui de fingres.,11
que je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots,11
Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.,11
hand de fingres et de nails.,11
Dites-moi l'Anglois pour le bras.,11
Et le coude?,11
De elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les,11
Il est trop difficile madame comme je pense.,11
de nails de arma de bilbow.,11
O Seigneur Dieu je m'en oublie! de elbow. Comment,11
De neck madame.,11
De chin.,11
Oui. Sauf votre honneur en verite vous prononcez,11
Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la grace de Dieu,11
N'avez vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?,11
fingres de mails--,11
De nails de arm de ilbow.,11
Ainsi dis-je; de elbow de nick et de sin. Comment,11
De foot madame; et de coun.,11
de son mauvais corruptible gros et impudique et,11
prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France,11
Neanmoins je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon,11
elbow de nick de sin de foot de coun.,11
C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.,11
SCENE V. The same.,11
Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.,11
Let us not live in France; let us quit all,11
O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,11
Our scions put in wild and savage stock,11
And overlook their grafters?,11
Mort de ma vie! if they march along,11
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm,11
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?,11
On whom as in despite the sun looks pale,11
A drench for sur-rein'd jades their barley-broth,11
And shall our quick blood spirited with wine,11
Let us not hang like roping icicles,11
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!,11
By faith and honour,11
Our mettle is bred out and they will give,11
To new-store France with bastard warriors.,11
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;,11
And that we are most lofty runaways.,11
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.,11
More sharper than your swords hie to the field:,11
You Dukes of Orleans Bourbon and of Berri,11
Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont,11
Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois;,11
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.,11
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:,11
Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat,11
Go down upon him you have power enough,11
Bring him our prisoner.,11
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,11
For I am sure when he shall see our army,11
And for achievement offer us his ransom.,11
And let him say to England that we send,11
Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen.,11
Be patient for you shall remain with us.,11
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.,11
SCENE VI. The English camp in Picardy.,11
How now Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?,11
committed at the bridge.,11
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;,11
heart and my duty and my life and my living and,11
blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the,11
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the,11
valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no,11
gallant service.,11
He is called Aunchient Pistol.,11
Enter PISTOL,11
Captain I thee beseech to do me favours:,11
Ay I praise God; and I have merited some love at,11
Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart,11
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,11
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--,11
painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to,11
painted also with a wheel to signify to you which,11
inconstant and mutability and variation: and her,11
which rolls and rolls and rolls: in good truth,11
Fortune is an excellent moral.,11
For he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a' be:,11
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free,11
But Exeter hath given the doom of death,11
Therefore go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:,11
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:,11
Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning.,11
Certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice,11
desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put,11
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!,11
The fig of Spain!,11
Very good.,11
remember him now; a bawd a cutpurse.,11
bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it,11
I warrant you when time is serve.,11
goes to the wars to grace himself at his return,11
fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:,11
done; at such and such a sconce at such a breach,11
shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on;,11
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what,11
the camp will do among foaming bottles and,11
you must learn to know such slanders of the age or,11
I tell you what Captain Gower; I do perceive he is,11
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat I will,11
Drum heard,11
him from the pridge.,11
God pless your majesty!,11
Ay so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has,11
gone off look you; and there is gallant and most,11
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to,11
pridge: I can tell your majesty the duke is a,11
What men have you lost Fluellen?,11
great reasonable great: marry for my part I,11
is like to be executed for robbing a church one,11
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o',11
a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red;,11
We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we,11
country there be nothing compelled from the,11
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;,11
gentler gamester is the soonest winner.,11
You know me by my habit.,11
My master's mind.,11
Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:,11
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we,11
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were,11
is imperial: England shall repent his folly see,11
therefore consider of his ransom; which must,11
have lost the disgrace we have digested; which in,11
For our losses his exchequer is too poor; for the,11
faint a number; and for our disgrace his own,11
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and,11
followers whose condemnation is pronounced. So far,11
What is thy name? I know thy quality.,11
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.,11
But could be willing to march on to Calais,11
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much,11
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,11
Almost no better than so many French;,11
I thought upon one pair of English legs,11
That I do brag thus! This your air of France,11
Go therefore tell thy master here I am;,11
My army but a weak and sickly guard;,11
Though France himself and such another neighbour,11
Go bid thy master well advise himself:,11
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood,11
The sum of all our answer is but this:,11
Nor as we are we say we will not shun it:,11
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.,11
I hope they will not come upon us now.,11
March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:,11
And on to-morrow bid them march away.,11
SCENE VII. The French camp near Agincourt:,11
Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!,11
It is the best horse of Europe.,11
My lord of Orleans and my lord high constable you,11
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.,11
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.,11
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant the Pegasus,11
soar I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth,11
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.,11
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for,11
elements of earth and water never appear in him but,11
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you,11
Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse.,11
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.,11
Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the,11
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as,11
tongues and my horse is argument for them all:,11
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the,11
their particular functions and wonder at him. I,11
Wonder of nature'--,11
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my,11
Your mistress bears well.,11
perfection of a good and particular mistress.,11
shook your back.,11
Mine was not bridled.,11
like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in,11
You have good judgment in horsemanship.,11
not warily fall into foul bogs. I had rather have,11
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.,11
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow,11
Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et,11
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any,11
My lord constable the armour that I saw in your tent,11
Stars my lord.,11
And yet my sky shall not want.,11
twere more honour some were away.,11
trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.,11
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile and,11
I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of,11
fain be about the ears of the English.,11
You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them.,11
Exit,11
He longs to eat the English.,11
By the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince.,11
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.,11
He never did harm that I heard of.,11
I know him to be valiant.,11
you.,11
Marry he told me so himself; and he said he cared,11
He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.,11
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it,11
Ill will never said well.,11
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.',11
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A,11
You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A,11
You have shot over.,11
Enter a Messenger,11
fifteen hundred paces of your tents.,11
The Lord Grandpre.,11
day! Alas poor Harry of England! he longs not for,11
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of,11
far out of his knowledge!,11
That they lack; for if their heads had any,11
head-pieces.,11
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.,11
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like,11
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.,11
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving,11
great meals of beef and iron and steel they will,11
Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef.,11
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:,11
It is now two o'clock: but let me see by ten,11
Exeunt,11
PROLOGUE,11
Now entertain conjecture of a time,11
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.,11
The hum of either army stilly sounds,11
The secret whispers of each other's watch:,11
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;,11
Piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents,11
With busy hammers closing rivets up,11
The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll,11
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,11
Do the low-rated English play at dice;,11
Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp,11
Like sacrifices by their watchful fires,11
The morning's danger and their gesture sad,11
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon,11
The royal captain of this ruin'd band,11
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!',11
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,11
Upon his royal face there is no note,11
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour,11
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint,11
That every wretch pining and pale before,11
A largess universal like the sun,11
Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all,11
A little touch of Harry in the night.,11
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace,11
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,11
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.,11
SCENE I. The English camp at Agincourt.,11
Gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger;,11
Good morrow brother Bedford. God Almighty!,11
Would men observingly distil it out.,11
Which is both healthful and good husbandry:,11
And preachers to us all admonishing,11
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,11
Enter ERPINGHAM,11
A good soft pillow for that good white head,11
Not so my liege: this lodging likes me better,11
Tis good for men to love their present pains,11
And when the mind is quicken'd out of doubt,11
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,11
Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas. Brothers both,11
Do my good morrow to them and anon,11
We shall my liege.,11
No my good knight;,11
I and my bosom must debate awhile,11
The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry!,11
God-a-mercy old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.,11
Qui va la?,11
Discuss unto me; art thou officer?,11
I am a gentleman of a company.,11
Even so. What are you?,11
Then you are a better than the king.,11
A lad of life an imp of fame;,11
I kiss his dirty shoe and from heart-string,11
Harry le Roy.,11
No I am a Welshman.,11
Yes.,11
Upon Saint Davy's day.,11
lest he knock that about yours.,11
And his kinsman too.,11

Under what captain serve you?,11
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I,11
Even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be,11
He hath not told his thought to the king?,11
speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I,11
element shows to him as it doth to me; all his,11
laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man; and,11
yet when they stoop they stoop with the like,11
do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish,11
him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing,11
He may show what outward courage he will; but I,11
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he,11
By my troth I will speak my conscience of the king:,11
where he is.,11
sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved.,11
alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's,11
contented as in the king's company; his cause being,11
That's more than we know.,11
enough if we know we are the kings subjects: if,11
the crime of it out of us.,11
a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and,11
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at,11

outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach,11
Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon,11
But I do not desire he should answer for me; and,11
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.,11
when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we,11
If I live to see it I will never trust his word after.,11

Exeunt soldiers,11

Of every fool whose sense no more can feel,11
Must kings neglect that private men enjoy!,11
Save ceremony save general ceremony?,11
What kind of god art thou that suffer'st more,11
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?,11
What is thy soul of adoration?,11
Creating awe and fear in other men?,11
Than they in fearing.,11
But poison'd flattery? O be sick great greatness,11
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out,11
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?,11
Command the health of it? No thou proud dream,11
I am a king that find thee and I know,11
The sword the mace the crown imperial,11
The farced title running 'fore the king,11
That beats upon the high shore of this world,11
Not all these laid in bed majestical,11
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind,11
Never sees horrid night the child of hell,11
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night,11
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,11
With profitable labour to his grave:,11
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,11
The slave a member of the country's peace,11
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,11
Enter ERPINGHAM,11
Seek through your camp to find you.,11
Collect them all together at my tent:,11

O not to-day think not upon the fault,11
I Richard's body have interred anew;,11
Than from it issued forced drops of blood:,11
Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up,11
Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests,11

Imploring pardon.,11

Mount them and make incision in their hides,11
And dout them with superfluous courage ha!,11
How shall we then behold their natural tears?,11
The English are embattled you French peers.,11
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,11
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.,11
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins,11
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,11
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.,11
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,11
About our squares of battle were enow,11
Though we upon this mountain's basis by,11
But that our honours must not. What's to say?,11
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound,11
For our approach shall so much dare the field,11
Enter GRANDPRE,11
Yon island carrions desperate of their bones,11
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,11
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host,11
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,11
Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips,11
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit,11
And their executors the knavish crows,11
Description cannot suit itself in words,11
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.,11
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,11
And after fight with them?,11
I will the banner from a trumpet take,11
The sun is high and we outwear the day.,11
SCENE III. The English camp.,11
Where is the king?,11
Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.,11
God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.,11
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,11
My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter,11
Farewell good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!,11
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,11
Exit SALISBURY,11
Princely in both.,11
O that we now had here,11

To do our country loss; and if to live,11
God's will! I pray thee wish not one man more.,11
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;,11
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:,11
I am the most offending soul alive.,11
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour,11
For the best hope I have. O do not wish one more!,11
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,11
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:,11
That fears his fellowship to die with us.,11
He that outlives this day and comes safe home,11
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.,11
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,11
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.,11
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,11
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.,11
Harry the king Bedford and Exeter,11
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.,11
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,11
But we in it shall be remember'd;,11
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me,11
This day shall gentle his condition:,11
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,11
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.,11
My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed:,11
And will with all expedience charge on us.,11
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!,11
God's will! my liege would you and I alone,11
Why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;,11
You know your places: God be with you all!,11
Once more I come to know of thee King Harry,11
Before thy most assured overthrow:,11
Thou needs must be englutted. Besides in mercy,11
Thy followers of repentance; that their souls,11
From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies,11
Who hath sent thee now?,11
I pray thee bear my former answer back:,11
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?,11
While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.,11
Find native graves; upon the which I trust,11
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,11
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,11
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,11
Mark then abounding valour in our English,11
Break out into a second course of mischief,11
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable,11
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd,11
There's not a piece of feather in our host--,11
And time hath worn us into slovenry:,11
And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night,11
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads,11
As if God please they shall--my ransom then,11
Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald:,11
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,11

Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,11
O pardonnez moi!,11
Come hither boy: ask me this slave in French,11
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?,11

Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.,11
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous,11

Peasant unless thou give me crowns brave crowns;,11
O je vous supplie pour l'amour de Dieu me,11

He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of,11
two hundred crowns.,11

vaillant et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.,11
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks; and,11

As I suck blood I will some mercy show.,11
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.,11
I did never know so full a voice issue from so,11

O diable!,11
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded all!,11
Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!,11
A short alarum,11
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.,11
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?,11
Let us die in honour: once more back again;,11
Let him go hence and with his cap in hand,11
Whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog,11
Disorder that hath spoil'd us friend us now!,11
We are enow yet living in the field,11
If any order might be thought upon.,11
Let life be short; else shame will be too long.,11
SCENE VI. Another part of the field.,11
Well have we done thrice valiant countrymen:,11
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.,11
I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;,11
In which array brave soldier doth he lie,11
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,11
Suffolk first died: and York all haggled over,11
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes,11
And cries aloud 'Tarry dear cousin Suffolk!,11
Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast,11
We kept together in our chivalry!',11
He smiled me in the face raught me his hand,11
Commend my service to me sovereign.',11
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;,11
A testament of noble-ending love.,11
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;,11
And all my mother came into mine eyes,11

With mistful eyes or they will issue too.,11
But hark! what new alarum is this same?,11

Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:,11
Or void the field; they do offend our sight:,11

Killing them twice. O give us leave great king,11

The glove which I have given him for a favour,11

And give it to this fellow. Keep it fellow;,11

Of time of numbers and due course of things,11
Be here presented. Now we bear the king,11
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts,11

Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king,11
And solemnly see him set on to London.,11

His bruised helmet and his bended sword,11
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;,11
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,11

Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst base Trojan,11
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.,11

So are you princes English every one.,11
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,11

The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:,11
Have lost their quality and that this day,11
To cry amen to that thus we appear.,11

You have congreeted let it not disgrace me,11
What rub or what impediment there is,11
Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,11
Our fertile France put up her lovely visage?,11
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,11
Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart,11
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,11
The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory,11
That should deracinate such savagery;,11
The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover,11
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems,11
Losing both beauty and utility.,11
Defective in their natures grow to wildness,11
Have lost or do not learn for want of time,11
But grow like savages--as soldiers will,11
To swearing and stern looks diffused attire,11
Which to reduce into our former favour,11
That I may know the let why gentle Peace,11
And bless us with her former qualities.,11
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections,11
With full accord to all our just demands;,11
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.,11
There is no answer made.,11
Which you before so urged lies in his answer.,11
O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace,11
To sit with us once more with better heed,11
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.,11
And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester,11
And take with you free power to ratify,11
Shall see advantageable for our dignity,11
And we'll consign thereto. Will you fair sister,11
Our gracious brother I will go with them:,11
When articles too nicely urged be stood on.,11
She is our capital demand comprised,11
She hath good leave.,11
Fair Katharine and most fair,11
Such as will enter at a lady's ear,11
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.,11
your French heart I will be glad to hear you,11
you like me Kate?,11
An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel.,11
Oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi dit-il.,11
affirm it.,11
tromperies.,11
are full of deceits?,11
deceits: dat is de princess.,11
Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am,11
thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king,11
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love but,11
farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out,11
clap hands and a bargain: how say you lady?,11
Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for,11
have neither words nor measure and for the other I,11
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at,11
armour on my back under the correction of bragging,11
Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse,11
sit like a jack-an-apes never off. But before God,11
eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation;,11
nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a,11
sun-burning that never looks in his glass for love,11
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst,11
that I shall die is true; but for thy love by the,11
livest dear Kate take a fellow of plain and,11
right because he hath not the gift to woo in other,11
can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours they do,11
speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A,11
black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow,11
hollow: but a good heart Kate is the sun and the,11
shines bright and never changes but keeps his,11
me; and take me take a soldier; take a soldier,11
speak my fair and fairly I pray thee.,11
No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of,11
the friend of France; for I love France so well that,11
all mine: and Kate when France is mine and I am,11
I cannot tell vat is dat.,11
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married,11
off. Je quand sur le possession de France et quand,11
then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est,11
Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much,11
unless it be to laugh at me.,11
est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.,11
tongue and I thine most truly-falsely must needs,11
understand thus much English canst thou love me?,11
Can any of your neighbours tell Kate? I'll ask,11
when you come into your closet you'll question this,11
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with,11
rather gentle princess because I love thee,11
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get,11
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,11
boy half French half English that shall go to,11
shall we not? what sayest thou my fair,11
I do not know dat,11
but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your,11
take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer,11
et devin deesse?,11
most sage demoiselle dat is en France.,11
true English I love thee Kate: by which honour I,11
flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor,11
my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars,11
stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when,11
Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear:,11
beauty can do no more spoil upon my face: thou,11
shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better:,11
have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the,11
take me by the hand and say 'Harry of England I am,11
ear withal but I will tell thee aloud 'England is,11
Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before,11
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.,11
music and thy English broken; therefore queen of,11
English; wilt thou have me?,11
Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please,11
Den it sall also content me.,11
Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez: ma foi je,11
baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne,11
tres-puissant seigneur.,11
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant,11
Madam my interpreter what says she?,11
France--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.,11
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.,11
before they are married would she say?,11
O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear,11
list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of,11
places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will,11
country in denying me a kiss: therefore patiently,11
Kissing her,11
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the,11
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general,11
Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN BURGUNDY and other Lords,11
our princess English?,11
perfectly I love her; and that is good English.,11
Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not,11
heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up,11
his true likeness.,11
for that. If you would conjure in her you must,11
likeness he must appear naked and blind. Can you,11
virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the,11
self? It were my lord a hard condition for a maid,11
Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces.,11
what they do.,11
I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will,11
summered and warm kept are like flies at,11
eyes; and then they will endure handling which,11
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;,11
latter end and she must be blind too.,11
It is so: and you may some of you thank love for,11
for one fair French maid that stands in my way.,11
turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with,11
Shall Kate be my wife?,11
I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may,11
my wish shall show me the way to my will.,11
Is't so my lords of England?,11
His daughter first and then in sequel all,11
Only he hath not yet subscribed this:,11
having any occasion to write for matter of grant,11
addition in French Notre trescher fils Henri Roi,11
Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex,11
Nor this I have not brother so denied,11
I pray you then in love and dear alliance,11
And thereupon give me your daughter.,11
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms,11
With envy of each other's happiness,11
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord,11
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.,11
Now welcome Kate: and bear me witness all,11
Flourish,11
Combine your hearts in one your realms in one!,11
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,11
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,11
To make divorce of their incorporate league;,11
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!,11
Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,11
And all the peers' for surety of our leagues.,11
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!,11
EPILOGUE,11
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen,11
In little room confining mighty men,11
Small time but in that small most greatly lived,11
By which the world's best garden be achieved,11
Henry the Sixth in infant bands crown'd King,11
Whose state so many had the managing,11
Which oft our stage hath shown; and for their sake,11
Exit,11
PROLOGUE,12
That bear a weighty and a serious brow,12
Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,12
May if they think it well let fall a tear;,12
Their money out of hope they may believe,12
Only a show or two and so agree,12
I'll undertake may see away their shilling,12
That come to hear a merry bawdy play,12
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,12
To rank our chosen truth with such a show,12
Our own brains and the opinion that we bring,12
Will leave us never an understanding friend.,12
The first and happiest hearers of the town,12
The very persons of our noble story,12
And follow'd with the general throng and sweat,12
How soon this mightiness meets misery:,12
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.,12
Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY,12
Since last we saw in France?,12
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer,12
An untimely ague,12
Those suns of glory those two lights of men,12
Twixt Guynes and Arde:,12
Beheld them when they lighted how they clung,12
Which had they what four throned ones could have weigh'd,12
All the whole time,12
Then you lost,12
Till this time pomp was single but now married,12
Became the next day's master till the last,12
All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods,12
Made Britain India: every man that stood,12
As cherubins all guilt: the madams too,12
The pride upon them that their very labour,12
Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night,12
Equal in lustre were now best now worst,12
Still him in praise: and being present both,12
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--,12
The noble spirits to arms they did perform,12
Being now seen possible enough got credit,12
O you go far.,12
In honour honesty the tract of every thing,12
Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;,12
Order gave each thing view; the office did,12
Who did guide,12
Of this great sport together as you guess?,12
In such a business.,12
All this was order'd by the good discretion,12
The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed,12
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder,12
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun,12
Surely sir,12
For being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace,12
For high feats done to the crown; neither allied,12
Out of his self-drawing web he gives us note,12
A gift that heaven gives for him which buys,12
I cannot tell,12
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride,12
If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,12
A new hell in himself.,12
Upon this French going out took he upon him,12
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file,12
To whom as great a charge as little honour,12
The honourable board of council out,12
I do know,12
By this so sickened their estates that never,12
O many,12
For this great journey. What did this vanity,12
A most poor issue?,12
The peace between the French and us not values,12
Every man,12
A thing inspired; and not consulting broke,12
Dashing the garment of this peace aboded,12
Which is budded out;,12
Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.,12
The ambassador is silenced?,12
A proper title of a peace; and purchased,12
Why all this business,12
Like it your grace,12
Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--,12
Honour and plenteous safety--that you read,12
Together; to consider further that,12
A minister in his power. You know his nature,12
Hath a sharp edge: it's long and 't may be said,12
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,12
That I advise your shunning.,12
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor ha?,12
Here so please you.,12
Ay please your grace.,12
Shall lessen this big look.,12
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd and I,12
Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book,12
What are you chafed?,12
Which your disease requires.,12
Matter against me; and his eye reviled,12
He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;,12
Stay my lord,12
What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills,12
A full-hot horse who being allow'd his way,12
Can advise me like you: be to yourself,12
I'll to the king;,12
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim,12
Be advised;,12
That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,12
And lose by over-running. Know you not,12
In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:,12
More stronger to direct you than yourself,12
Or but allay the fire of passion.,12
I am thankful to you; and I'll go along,12
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but,12
And proofs as clear as founts in July when,12
To be corrupt and treasonous.,12
To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong,12
Or wolf or both--for he is equal ravenous,12
As able to perform't; his mind and place,12
Only to show his pomp as well in France,12
To this last costly treaty the interview,12
Did break i' the rinsing.,12
Pray give me favour sir. This cunning cardinal,12
As himself pleased; and they were ratified,12
As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal,12
Who cannot err he did it. Now this follows--,12
To the old dam treason--Charles the emperor,12
For 'twas indeed his colour but he came,12
His fears were that the interview betwixt,12
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league,12
Deals with our cardinal; and as I trow--,12
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted,12
And paved with gold the emperor thus desired,12
And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,12
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,12
I am sorry,12
Something mistaken in't.,12
I  do pronounce him in that very shape,12
Enter BRANDON a Sergeant-at-arms before him and two or three of the Guard,12
Sir,12
Of Hereford Stafford and Northampton I,12
Of our most sovereign king.,12
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish,12
I am sorry,12
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure,12
It will help me nothing,12
Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven,12
O my Lord Abergavenny fare you well!,12
To ABERGAVENNY,12
How he determines further.,12
The will of heaven be done and the king's pleasure,12
Here is a warrant from,12
Of the duke's confessor John de la Car,12
So so;,12
A monk o' the Chartreux.,12
He.,12
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:,12
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,12
Exeunt,12
Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder the Nobles and LOVELL;  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side,12
Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level,12
To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us,12
I'll hear him his confessions justify;,12
He shall again relate.,12
Nay we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.,12
Never name to us; you have half our power:,12
Repeat your will and take it.,12
That you would love yourself and in that love,12
The dignity of your office is the point,12
Lady mine proceed.,12
And those of true condition that your subjects,12
Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart,12
My good lord cardinal they vent reproaches,12
Of these exactions yet the king our master--,12
escapes not,12
The sides of loyalty and almost appears,12
Not almost appears,12
The clothiers all not able to maintain,12
The spinsters carders fullers weavers who,12
And lack of other means in desperate manner,12
And danger serves among then!,12
Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,12
Know you of this taxation?,12
I know but of a single part in aught,12
Where others tell steps with me.,12
You know no more than others; but you frame,12
To those which would not know them and yet must,12
Whereof my sovereign would have note they are,12
The back is sacrifice to the load. They say,12
Too hard an exclamation.,12
The nature of it? in what kind let's know,12
I am much too venturous,12
Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief,12
The sixth part of his substance to be levied,12
Is named your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:,12
Allegiance in them; their curses now,12
This tractable obedience is a slave,12
Would give it quick consideration for,12
By my life,12
And for me,12
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but,12
Traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know,12
The chronicles of my doing let me say,12
That virtue must go through. We must not stint,12
To cope malicious censurers; which ever,12
That is new-trimm'd but benefit no further,12
By sick interpreters once weak ones is,12
Hitting a grosser quality is cried up,12
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,12
State-statues only.,12
And with a care exempt themselves from fear;,12
Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent,12
We must not rend our subjects from our laws,12
A trembling contribution! Why we take,12
And though we leave it with a root thus hack'd,12
Where this is question'd send our letters with,12
The force of this commission: pray look to't;,12
A word with you.,12
Let there be letters writ to every shire,12
Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised,12
And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you,12
Exit Secretary,12
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham,12
It grieves many:,12
To nature none more bound; his training such,12
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,12
Not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt,12
Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,12
Almost with ravish'd listening could not find,12
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces,12
As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--,12
Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount,12
We cannot feel too little hear too much.,12
Most like a careful subject have collected,12
Speak freely.,12
It would infect his speech that if the king,12
To make the sceptre his: these very words,12
Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced,12
Please your highness note,12
Not friended by by his wish to your high person,12
Beyond you to your friends.,12
Deliver all with charity.,12
How grounded he his title to the crown,12
At any time speak aught?,12
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.,12
Sir a Chartreux friar,12
With words of sovereignty.,12
Not long before your highness sped to France,12
Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand,12
Concerning the French journey: I replied,12
To the king's danger. Presently the duke,12
Twould prove the verity of certain words,12
Hath sent to me wishing me to permit,12
To hear from him a matter of some moment:,12
He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke,12
To me should utter with demure confidence,12
Tell you the duke shall prosper: bid him strive,12
Shall govern England.',12
You were the duke's surveyor and lost your office,12
You charge not in your spleen a noble person,12
Yes heartily beseech you.,12
Go forward.,12
I told my lord the duke by the devil's illusions,12
To ruminate on this so far until,12
It was much like to do: he answer'd 'Tush,12
That had the king in his last sickness fail'd,12
Should have gone off.,12
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?,12
Proceed.,12
After your highness had reproved the duke,12
I remember,12
The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?,12
As to the Tower I thought I would have play'd,12
The usurper Richard; who being at Salisbury,12
As he made semblance of his duty would,12
A giant traitor!,12
and this man out of prison?,12
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?,12
He stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger,12
He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor,12
His father by as much as a performance,12
There's his period,12
Call him to present trial: if he may,12
Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,12
Exeunt,12
Enter Chamberlain and SANDS,12
Men into such strange mysteries?,12
Though they be never so ridiculous,12
As far as I see all the good our English,12
A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;,12
Their very noses had been counsellors,12
They have all new legs and lame ones: one would take it,12
Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.,12
Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,12
Enter LOVELL,12
What news Sir Thomas Lovell?,12
I hear of none but the new proclamation,12
What is't for?,12
That fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors.,12
To think an English courtier may be wise,12
They must either,12
Of fool and feather that they got in France,12
Pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks,12
Out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean,12
Short blister'd breeches and those types of travel,12
Or pack to their old playfellows: there I take it,12
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.,12
Are grown so catching.,12
Will have of these trim vanities!,12
There will be woe indeed lords: the sly whoresons,12
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.,12
For sure there's no converting of 'em: now,12
A long time out of play may bring his plainsong,12
Held current music too.,12
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.,12
Nor shall not while I have a stump.,12
Whither were you a-going?,12
Your lordship is a guest too.,12
This night he makes a supper and a great one,12
The beauty of this kingdom I'll assure you.,12
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;,12
No doubt he's noble;,12
He may my lord; has wherewithal: in him,12
Men of his way should be most liberal;,12
True they are so:,12
Your lordship shall along. Come good Sir Thomas,12
For I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guildford,12
I am your lordship's.,12
SCENE IV. A Hall in York Place.,12
Ladies a general welcome from his grace,12
To fair content and you: none here he hopes,12
One care abroad; he would have all as merry,12
Can make good people. O my lord you're tardy:,12
The very thought of this fair company,12
You are young Sir Harry Guildford.,12
But half my lay thoughts in him some of these,12
I think would better please 'em: by my life,12
O that your lordship were but now confessor,12
I would I were;,12
Faith how easy?,12
Sweet ladies will it please you sit? Sir Harry,12
His grace is entering. Nay you must not freeze;,12
My Lord Sands you are one will keep 'em waking;,12
By my faith,12
If I chance to talk a little wild forgive me;,12
Was he mad sir?,12
But he would bite none; just as I do now,12
Kisses her,12
So now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,12
Pass away frowning.,12
Let me alone.,12
You're welcome my fair guests: that noble lady,12
Is not my friend: this to confirm my welcome;,12
Drinks,12
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,12
My Lord Sands,12
Ladies you are not merry: gentlemen,12
The red wine first must rise,12
Talk us to silence.,12
My Lord Sands.,12
Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it madam,12
You cannot show me.,12
Drum and trumpet chambers discharged,12
Look out there some of ye.,12
What warlike voice,12
By all the laws of war you're privileged.,12
How now! what is't?,12
For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;,12
From foreign princes.,12
Go give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;,12
Into our presence where this heaven of beauty,12
Exit Chamberlain attended. All rise and tables removed,12
A good digestion to you all: and once more,12
Hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VIII and others as  masquers habited like shepherds ushered by the  Chamberlain. They pass directly before CARDINAL WOLSEY and gracefully salute him,12
Because they speak no English thus they pray'd,12
Of this so noble and so fair assembly,12
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,12
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat,12
Say lord chamberlain,12
A thousand thanks and pray 'em take their pleasures.,12
The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,12
Music. Dance,12
Your grace?,12
There should be one amongst 'em by his person,12
If I but knew him with my love and duty,12
I will my lord.,12
What say they?,12
There is indeed; which they would have your grace,12
Let me see then.,12
My royal choice.,12
Unmasking,12
You are a churchman or I'll tell you cardinal,12
I am glad,12
My lord chamberlain,12
An't please your grace Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--,12
By heaven she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,12
And not to kiss you. A health gentlemen!,12
Sir Thomas Lovell is the banquet ready,12
Yes my lord.,12
I fear with dancing is a little heated.,12
There's fresher air my lord,12
Lead in your ladies every one: sweet partner,12
Good my lord cardinal I have half a dozen healths,12
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream,12
Exeunt with trumpets,12
SCENE I. Westminster. A street.,12
Whither away so fast?,12
Even to the hall to hear what shall become,12
I'll save you,12
Of bringing back the prisoner.,12
Yes indeed was I.,12
You may guess quickly what.,12
Yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't.,12
So are a number more.,12
I'll tell you in a little. The great duke,12
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged,12
The king's attorney on the contrary,12
Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired,12
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;,12
Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,12
That was he,12
The same.,12
Would have flung from him but indeed he could not:,12
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much,12
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.,12
When he was brought again to the bar to hear,12
With such an agony he sweat extremely,12
But he fell to himself again and sweetly,12
I do not think he fears death.,12
He never was so womanish; the cause,12
Certainly,12
Tis likely,12
Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,12
Lest he should help his father.,12
Was a deep envious one.,12
No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,12
The cardinal instantly will find employment,12
All the commons,12
Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much,12
The mirror of all courtesy;--,12
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.,12
Let's stand close and behold him.,12
You that thus far have come to pity me,12
I have this day received a traitor's judgment,12
And if I have a co nscience let it sink me,12
The law I bear no malice for my death;,12
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:,12
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,12
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.,12
Nor will I sue although the king have mercies,12
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,12
Is only bitter to him only dying,12
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,12
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on o' God's name.,12
If ever any malice in your heart,12
Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you,12
There cannot be those numberless offences,12
no black envy,12
And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him,12
Yet are the king's; and till my soul forsake,12
Longer than I have time to tell his years!,12
And when old time shall lead him to his end,12
To the water side I must conduct your grace;,12
Who undertakes you to your end.,12
The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;,12
The greatness of his person.,12
Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.,12
And Duke of Buckingham; now poor Edward Bohun:,12
That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;,12
My noble father Henry of Buckingham,12
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,12
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!,12
My father's loss like a most royal prince,12
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,12
That made me happy at one stroke has taken,12
And must needs say a noble one; which makes me,12
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both,12
A most unnatural and faithless service!,12
This from a dying man receive as certain:,12
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends,12
The least rub in your fortunes fall away,12
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,12
Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:,12
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!,12
O this is full of pity! Sir it calls,12
That were the authors.,12
Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling,12
Greater than this.,12
What may it be? You do not doubt my faith sir?,12
A strong faith to conceal it.,12
I do not talk much.,12
You shall sir: did you not of late days hear,12
Between the king and Katharine?,12
For when the king once heard it out of anger,12
To stop the rumor and allay those tongues,12
But that slander sir,12
Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain,12
Or some about him near have out of malice,12
That will undo her: to confirm this too,12
As all think for this business.,12
And merely to revenge him on the emperor,12
The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.,12
That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal,12
Tis woful.,12
Let's think in private more.,12
SCENE II. An ante-chamber in the palace.,12
My lord the horses your lordship sent for with,12
furnished. They were young and handsome and of the,12
set out for London a man of my lord cardinal's by,12
this reason: His master would be served before a,12
mouths sir.',12
He will have all I think.,12
Well met my lord chamberlain.,12
How is the king employ'd?,12
Full of sad thoughts and troubles.,12
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife,12
No his conscience,12
Tis so:,12
That blind priest like the eldest son of fortune,12
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.,12
And with what zeal! for now he has crack'd the league,12
He dives into the king's soul and there scatters,12
Fears and despairs; and all these for his marriage:,12
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her,12
About his neck yet never lost her lustre;,12
That angels love good men with; even of her,12
Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?,12
These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,12
Look into these affairs see this main end,12
The king's eyes that so long have slept upon,12
And free us from his slavery.,12
And heartily for our deliverance;,12
From princes into pages: all men's honours,12
Into what pitch he please.,12
I love him not nor fear him; there's my creed:,12
If the king please; his curses and his blessings,12
I knew him and I know him; so I leave him,12
Let's in;,12
From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him:,12
Excuse me;,12
You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:,12
Thanks my good lord chamberlain.,12
How sad he looks! sure he is much afflicted.,12
Pray God he be not angry.,12
Into my private meditations?,12
A gracious king that pardons all offences,12
Is business of estate; in which we come,12
Ye are too bold:,12
Is this an hour for temporal affairs ha?,12
Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,12
Thou art a cure fit for a king.,12
You're welcome,12
Use us and it.,12
My good lord have great care,12
Sir you cannot.,12
Of private conference.,12
We are busy; go.,12
This priest has no pride in him?,12
I would not be so sick though for his place:,12
[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do,12
[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.,12
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom,12
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:,12
The Spaniard tied blood and favour to her,12
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,12
Have their free voices: Rome the nurse of judgment,12
One general tongue unto us this good man,12
Whom once more I present unto your highness.,12
And thank the holy conclave for their loves:,12
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,12
I tender my commission; by whose virtue,12
Cardinal of York are join'd with me their servant,12
Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted,12
I know your majesty has always loved her,12
A woman of less place might ask by law:,12
Ay and the best she shall have; and my favour,12
Prithee call Gardiner to me my new secretary:,12
Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY,12
[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy and,12
You are the king's now.,12
But to be commanded,12
Come hither Gardiner.,12
My Lord of York was not one Doctor Pace,12
Yes he was.,12
Yes surely.,12
Even of yourself lord cardinal.,12
They will not stick to say you envied him,12
Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,12
Heaven's peace be with him!,12
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;,12
If I command him follows my appointment:,12
We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.,12
Exit GARDINER,12
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;,12
My Wolsey see it furnish'd. O my lord,12
So sweet a bedfellow? But conscience conscience!,12
Exeunt,12
Enter ANNE and an Old Lady,12
His highness having lived so long with her and she,12
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,12
So many courses of the sun enthroned,12
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than,12
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity,12
Hearts of most hard temper,12
O God's will! much better,12
Yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce,12
As soul and body's severing.,12
She's a stranger now again.,12
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,12
And range with humble livers in content,12
And wear a golden sorrow.,12
Is our best having.,12
I would not be a queen.,12
And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,12
You that have so fair parts of woman on you,12
Affected eminence wealth sovereignty;,12
Saving your mincing the capacity,12
If you might please to stretch it.,12
Yes troth and troth; you would not be a queen?,12
Old Lady: 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,12
What think you of a duchess? have you limbs,12
No in truth.,12
I would not be a young count in your way,12
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen'tis too weak,12
How you do talk!,12
For all the world.,12
You'ld venture an emballing: I myself,12
No more to the crown but that. Lo who comes here?,12
Good morrow ladies. What were't worth to know,12
My good lord,12
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.,12
The action of good women: there is hope,12
Now I pray God amen!,12
Follow such creatures. That you may fair lady,12
Ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty,12
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing,12
A thousand pound a year annual support,12
I do not know,12
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers,12
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes,12
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,12
Whose health and royalty I pray for.,12
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit,12
Aside,12
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled,12
But from this lady may proceed a gem,12
And say I spoke with you.,12
My honour'd lord.,12
I have been begging sixteen years in court,12
Come pat betwixt too early and too late,12
A very fresh-fish here--fie fie fie upon,12
Before you open it.,12
How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence no.,12
That would not be a queen that would she not,12
Come you are pleasant.,12
O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!,12
No other obligation! By my life,12
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time,12
Are you not stronger than you were?,12
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,12
If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,12
The queen is comfortless and we forgetful,12
What here you've heard to her.,12
Exeunt,12
Trumpets sennet and cornets. Enter two Vergers  with short silver wands; next them two Scribes in  the habit of doctors; after them CANTERBURY alone;  after him LINCOLN Ely Rochester and Saint  Asaph; next them with some small distance follows  a Gentleman bearing the purse with the great seal  and a cardinal's hat; then two Priests bearing  each a silver cross; then a Gentleman-usher  bare-headed accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms  bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing  two great silver pillars; after them side by side  CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS; two Noblemen  with the sword and mace. KING HENRY VIII takes  place under the cloth of state; CARDINAL WOLSEY and  CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as judges. QUEEN  KATHARINE takes place some distance from KING  HENRY VIII. The Bishops place themselves on each  side the court in manner of a consistory; below  them the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops.  The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order about the stage,12
Let silence be commanded.,12
It hath already publicly been read,12
You may then spare that time.,12
Say Henry King of England come into the court.,12
Here.,12
Katharine Queen of England  and c.,12
Sir I desire you do me right and justice;,12
I am a most poor woman and a stranger,12
No judge indifferent nor no more assurance,12
In what have I offended you? what cause,12
That thus you should proceed to put me off,12
I have been to you a true and humble wife,12
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,12
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour,12
Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends,12
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine,12
Continue in my liking? nay gave notice,12
That I have been your wife in this obedience,12
With many children by you: if in the course,12
And prove it too against mine honour aught,12
Against your sacred person in God's name,12
Shut door upon me and so give me up,12
The king your father was reputed for,12
And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,12
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many,12
That they had gather'd a wise council to them,12
Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly,12
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel,12
Your pleasure be fulfill'd!,12
And of your choice these reverend fathers; men,12
Yea the elect o' the land who are assembled,12
That longer you desire the court; as well,12
What is unsettled in the king.,12
Hath spoken well and justly: therefore madam,12
And that without delay their arguments,12
Lord cardinal,12
Your pleasure madam?,12
I am about to weep; but thinking that,12
The daughter of a king my drops of tears,12
Be patient yet.,12
Or God will punish me. I do believe,12
You are mine enemy and make my challenge,12
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;,12
I utterly abhor yea from my soul,12
I hold my most malicious foe and think not,12
I do profess,12
Have stood to charity and display'd the effects,12
O'ertopping woman's power. Madam you do me wrong:,12
For you or any: how far I have proceeded,12
By a commission from the consistory,12
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:,12
That I gainsay my deed how may he wound,12
As you have done my truth. If he know,12
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him,12
Remove these thoughts from you: the which before,12
You gracious madam to unthink your speaking,12
My lord my lord,12
To oppose your cunning. You're meek and,12
You sign your place and calling in full seeming,12
Is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride.,12
Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted,12
Domestics to you serve your will as't please,12
You tender more your person's honour than,12
I do refuse you for my judge; and here,12
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,12
She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII and offers to depart,12
Stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and,12
She's going away.,12
Katharine Queen of England come into the court.,12
What need you note it? pray you keep your way:,12
They vex me past my patience! Pray you pass on:,12
Upon this business my appearance make,12
Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants,12
That man i' the world who shall report he has,12
For speaking false in that: thou art alone,12
Thy meekness saint-like wife-like government,12
Sovereign and pious else could speak thee out,12
And like her true nobility she has,12
Most gracious sir,12
That it shall please you to declare in hearing,12
There must I be unloosed although not there,12
Did broach this business to your highness; or,12
Induce you to the question on't? or ever,12
A royal lady spake one the least word that might,12
Or touch of her good person?,12
I do excuse you; yea upon mine honour,12
That you have many enemies that know not,12
Bark when their fellows do: by some of these,12
But will you be more justified? You ever,12
It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd oft,12
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,12
I will be bold with time and your attention:,12
My conscience first received a tenderness,12
By the Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador;,12
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and,12
Ere a determinate resolution he,12
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise,12
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,12
The bosom of my conscience enter'd me,12
The region of my breast; which forced such way,12
And press'd in with this caution. First methought,12
Commanded nature that my lady's womb,12
Do no more offices of life to't than,12
Or died where they were made or shortly after,12
This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,12
Be gladded in't by me: then follows that,12
By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me,12
The wild sea of my conscience I did steer,12
Now present here together: that's to say,12
I then did feel full sick and yet not well--,12
And doctors learn'd: first I began in private,12
How under my oppression I did reek,12
Very well my liege.,12
How far you satisfied me.,12
The question did at first so stagger me,12
And consequence of dread that I committed,12
And did entreat your highness to this course,12
I then moved you,12
To make this present summons: unsolicited,12
But by particular consent proceeded,12
For no dislike i' the world against the person,12
Of my alleged reasons drive this forward:,12
And kingly dignity we are contented,12
Katharine our queen before the primest creature,12
So please your highness,12
That we adjourn this court till further day:,12
Made to the queen to call back her appeal,12
[Aside] I may perceive,12
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.,12
Prithee return: with thy approach I know,12
I say set on.,12
ACT III,12
Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women as at work,12
Sing and disperse 'em if thou canst: leave working.,12
Orpheus with his lute made trees,12
Bow themselves when he did sing:,12
Ever sprung; as sun and showers,12
Every thing that heard him play,12
Hung their heads and then lay by.,12
Killing care and grief of heart,12
Enter a Gentleman,12
An't please your grace the two great cardinals,12
Would they speak with me?,12
Pray their graces,12
Exit Gentleman,12
With me a poor weak woman fall'n from favour?,12
They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:,12
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,12
Your graces find me here part of a housewife,12
What are your pleasures with me reverend lords?,12
Into your private chamber we shall give you,12
Speak it here:,12
Deserves a corner: would all other women,12
My lords I care not so much I am happy,12
Were tried by every tongue every eye saw 'em,12
I know my life so even. If your business,12
Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.,12
serenissima--,12
I am not such a truant since my coming,12
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,12
Pray speak in English: here are some will thank you,12
Believe me she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,12
May be absolved in English.,12
I am sorry my integrity should breed,12
So deep suspicion where all faith was meant.,12
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,12
You have too much good lady; but to know,12
Between the king and you; and to deliver,12
And comforts to your cause.,12
My Lord of York out of his noble nature,12
Forgetting like a good man your late censure,12
Offers as I do in a sign of peace,12
[Aside] To betray me.--,12
Ye speak like honest men; pray God ye prove so!,12
In such a point of weight so near mine honour--,12
And to such men of gravity and learning,12
Among my maids: full little God knows looking,12
For her sake that I have been--for I feel,12
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:,12
Madam you wrong the king's love with these fears:,12
In England,12
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?,12
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,12
They that must weigh out my afflictions,12
They are as all my other comforts far hence,12
I would your grace,12
How sir?,12
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much,12
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,12
He tells you rightly.,12
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!,12
That no king can corrupt.,12
The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,12
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:,12
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,12
I will not wish ye half my miseries;,12
Take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once,12
Madam this is a mere distraction;,12
Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye,12
If you have any justice any pity;,12
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?,12
His love too long ago! I am old my lords,12
Is only my obedience. What can happen,12
Make me a curse like this.,12
Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,12
A woman I dare say without vain-glory,12
Have I with all my full affections,12
obey'd him?,12
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?,12
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,12
And to that woman when she has done most,12
Madam you wander from the good we aim at.,12
To give up willingly that noble title,12
Shall e'er divorce my dignities.,12
Would I had never trod this English earth,12
Ye have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts.,12
I am the most unhappy woman living.,12
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity,12
Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,12
I'll hang my head and perish.,12
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,12
Upon what cause wrong you? alas our places,12
We are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em.,12
How you may hurt yourself ay utterly,12
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,12
They swell and grow as terrible as storms.,12
A soul as even as a calm: pray think us,12
Madam you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues,12
As yours was put into you ever casts,12
Beware you lose it not: for us if you please,12
To use our utmost  studies in your service.,12
If I have used myself unmannerly;,12
To make a seemly answer to such persons.,12
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers,12
Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,12
She should have bought her dignities so dear.,12
SCENE II. Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.,12
If you will now unite in your complaints,12
Cannot stand under them: if you omit,12
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,12
I am joyful,12
Remembrance of my father-in-law the duke,12
Which of the peers,12
Strangely neglected? when did he regard,12
Out of himself?,12
What he deserves of you and me I know;,12
Gives way to us I much fear. If you cannot,12
Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft,12
O fear him not;,12
Matter against him that for ever mars,12
Not to come off in his displeasure.,12
I should be glad to hear such news as this,12
Believe it this is true:,12
Are all unfolded wherein he appears,12
How came,12
Most strangely.,12
The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,12
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness,12
It did take place 'I do' quoth he 'perceive,12
A creature of the queen's Lady Anne Bullen.',12
Believe it.,12
The king in this perceives him how he coasts,12
All his tricks founder and he brings his physic,12
Hath married the fair lady.,12
May you be happy in your wish my lord,12
Now all my joy,12
My amen to't!,12
There's order given for her coronation:,12
To some ears unrecounted. But my lords,12
In mind and feature: I persuade me from her,12
In it be memorised.,12
Digest this letter of the cardinal's?,12
Marry amen!,12
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose,12
Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;,12
Is posted as the agent of our cardinal,12
The king cried Ha! at this.,12
And let him cry Ha! louder!,12
When returns Cranmer?,12
Have satisfied the king for his divorce,12
Almost in Christendom: shortly I believe,12
Her coronation. Katharine no more,12
And widow to Prince Arthur.,12
A worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain,12
He has; and we shall see him,12
So I hear.,12
The cardinal!,12
Observe observe he's moody.,12
Gave't you the king?,12
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?,12
He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,12
Was in his countenance. You he bade,12
Is he ready,12
I think by this he is.,12
Exit CROMWELL,12
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,12
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:,12
No we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish,12
He's discontented.,12
Does whet his anger to him.,12
Lord for thy justice!,12
a knight's daughter,12
This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;,12
And well deserving? yet I know her for,12
Our cause that she should lie i' the bosom of,12
An heretic an arch one Cranmer; one,12
And is his oracle.,12
I would 'twere something that would fret the string,12
Enter KING HENRY VIII reading of a schedule and LOVELL,12
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated,12
Seems to flow from him! How i' the name of thrift,12
Saw you the cardinal?,12
Stood here observing him: some strange commotion,12
Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground,12
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,12
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures,12
It may well be;,12
Papers of state he sent me to peruse,12
There--on my conscience put unwittingly?,12
The several parcels of his plate his treasure,12
I find at such proud rate that it out-speaks,12
It's heaven's will:,12
To bless your eye withal.,12
His contemplation were above the earth,12
Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid,12
His serious considering.,12
Heaven forgive me!,12
Good my lord,12
Of your best graces in your mind; the which,12
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span,12
I deem you an ill husband and am glad,12
Sir,12
To think upon the part of business which,12
Her times of preservation which perforce,12
Must give my tendence to.,12
And ever may your highness yoke together,12
With my well saying!,12
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:,12
His said he did; and with his deed did crown,12
I have kept you next my heart; have not alone,12
But pared my present havings to bestow,12
[Aside]             What should this mean?,12
Have I not made you,12
If what I now pronounce you have found true:,12
If you are bound to us or no. What say you?,12
Shower'd on me daily have been more than could,12
Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours,12
Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends,12
To the good of your most sacred person and,12
Heap'd upon me poor undeserver I,12
My prayers to heaven for you my loyalty,12
Till death that winter kill it.,12
A loyal and obedient subject is,12
Does pay the act of it; as i' the contrary,12
That as my hand has open'd bounty to you,12
On you than any; so your hand and heart,12
Should notwithstanding that your bond of duty,12
To me your friend than any.,12
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd,12
Though all the world should crack their duty to you,12
Abound as thick as thought could make 'em and,12
As doth a rock against the chiding flood,12
And stand unshaken yours.,12
Take notice lords he has a loyal breast,12
Giving him papers,12
What appetite you have.,12
What should this mean?,12
He parted frowning from me as if ruin,12
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;,12
I fear the story of his anger. 'Tis so;,12
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together,12
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!,12
Made me put this main secret in the packet,12
No new device to beat this from his brains?,12
A way if it take right in spite of fortune,12
The letter as I live with all the business,12
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;,12
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall,12
And no man see me more.,12
Hear the king's pleasure cardinal: who commands you,12
Into our hands; and to confine yourself,12
Till you hear further from his highness.,12
Where's your commission lords? words cannot carry,12
Who dare cross 'em,12
Till I find more than will or words to do it,12
I dare and must deny it. Now I feel,12
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,12
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!,12
You have Christian warrant for 'em and no doubt,12
You ask with such a violence the king,12
Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours,12
Tied it by letters-patents: now who'll take it?,12
It must be himself then.,12
Proud lord thou liest:,12
Have burnt that tongue than said so.,12
Thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land,12
The heads of all thy brother cardinals,12
Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!,12
Far from his succor from the king from all,12
Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity,12
This and all else,12
I answer is most false. The duke by law,12
From any private malice in his end,12
If I loved many words lord I should tell you,12
That in the way of loyalty and truth,12
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,12
By my soul,12
shouldst feel,12
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?,12
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,12
And dare us with his cap like larks.,12
Is poison to thy stomach.,12
Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,12
The goodness of your intercepted packets,12
Since you provoke me shall be most notorious.,12
As you respect the common good the state,12
Who if he live will scarce be gentlemen,12
Collected from his life. I'll startle you,12
Lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal.,12
But that I am bound in charity against it!,12
But thus much they are foul ones.,12
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,12
This cannot save you:,12
Some of these articles; and out they shall.,12
You'll show a little honesty.,12
I dare your worst objections: if I blush,12
I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!,12
You wrought to be a legate; by which power,12
Then that in all you writ to Rome or else,12
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king,12
Then that without the knowledge,12
Ambassador to the emperor you made bold,12
Item you sent a large commission,12
Without the king's will or the state's allowance,12
That out of mere ambition you have caused,12
Then that you have sent innumerable substance--,12
To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways,12
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;,12
I will not taint my mouth with.,12
Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:,12
Not you correct him. My heart weeps to see him,12
I forgive him.,12
Because all those things you have done of late,12
Fall into the compass of a praemunire,12
To forfeit all your goods lands tenements,12
Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.,12
How to live better. For your stubborn answer,12
The king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you.,12
Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY,12
Farewell! a long farewell to all my greatness!,12
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,12
The third day comes a frost a killing frost,12
His greatness is a-ripening nips his root,12
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,12
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride,12
Weary and old with service to the mercy,12
Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye:,12
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!,12
That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin,12
And when he falls he falls like Lucifer,12
Enter CROMWELL and stands amazed,12
I have no power to speak sir.,12
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder,12
I am fall'n indeed.,12
Why well;,12
I know myself now; and I feel within me,12
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,12
These ruin'd pillars out of pity taken,12
O 'tis a burthen Cromwell 'tis a burthen,12
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.,12
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,12
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.,12
The heaviest and the worst,12
God bless him!,12
Lord chancellor in your place.,12
But he's a learned man. May he continue,12
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,12
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?,12
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.,12
Last that the Lady Anne,12
This day was view'd in open as his queen,12
Only about her coronation.,12
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories,12
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,12
Upon my smiles. Go get thee from me Cromwell;,12
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;,12
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;,12
I know his noble nature--not to let,12
Neglect him not; make use now and provide,12
O my lord,12
So good so noble and so true a master?,12
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.,12
For ever and for ever shall be yours.,12
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,12
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me Cromwell;,12
And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention,12
Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory,12
Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in;,12
Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me.,12
By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,12
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;,12
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,12
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,12
O Cromwell,12
And--prithee lead me in:,12
To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,12
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell Cromwell!,12
I served my king he would not in mine age,12
Good sir have patience.,12
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.,12
ACT IV,12
Enter two Gentlemen meeting one another,12
So are you.,12
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?,12
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.,12
This general joy.,12
I am sure have shown at full their royal minds--,12
In celebration of this day with shows,12
Never greater,12
May I be bold to ask at what that contains,12
Yes; 'tis the list,12
By custom of the coronation.,12
To be high-steward; next the Duke of Norfolk,12
I thank you sir: had I not known those customs,12
But I beseech you what's become of Katharine,12
That I can tell you too. The Archbishop,12
Learned and reverend fathers of his order,12
From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which,12
And to be short for not appearance and,12
Of all these learned men she was divorced,12
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,12
Alas good lady!,12
The trumpets sound: stand close the queen is coming.,12
THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION,12
2. Then two Judges.,12
before him.,12
Music,12
Garter in his coat of arms and on his,12
6. Marquess Dorset bearing a sceptre of gold,12
him SURREY bearing the rod of silver with,12
Collars of SS.,12
on his head bearing a long white wand as,12
rod of marshalship a coronet on his head.,12
8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;,12
richly adorned with pearl crowned. On each,12
Winchester.,12
gold wrought with flowers bearing QUEEN,12
10. Certain Ladies or Countesses with plain,12
They pass over the stage in order and state,12
Who's that that bears the sceptre?,12
And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.,12
The Duke of Suffolk?,12
And that my Lord of Norfolk?,12
Heaven bless thee!,12
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.,12
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,12
I cannot blame his conscience.,12
The cloth of honour over her are four barons,12
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.,12
Is that old noble lady Duchess of Norfolk.,12
Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;,12
No more of that.,12
Enter a third Gentleman,12
Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger,12
With the mere rankness of their joy.,12
The ceremony?,12
How was it?,12
Good sir speak it to us.,12
Of lords and ladies having brought the queen,12
A distance from her; while her grace sat down,12
In a rich chair of state opposing freely,12
Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman,12
Had the full view of such a noise arose,12
As loud and to as many tunes: hats cloaks--,12
Been loose this day they had been lost. Such joy,12
That had not half a week to go like rams,12
And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living,12
So strangely in one piece.,12
At length her grace rose and with modest paces,12
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.,12
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury,12
As holy oil Edward Confessor's crown,12
Laid nobly on her: which perform'd the choir,12
Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,12
To York-place where the feast is held.,12
You must no more call it York-place that's past;,12
Tis now the king's and call'd Whitehall.,12
But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name,12
What two reverend bishops,12
Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,12
The other London.,12
Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,12
All the land knows that:,12
Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.,12
Thomas Cromwell;,12
A worthy friend. The king has made him master,12
And one already of the privy council.,12
Yes without all doubt.,12
Is to the court and there ye shall be my guests:,12
I'll tell ye more.,12
Exeunt,12
Enter KATHARINE Dowager sick; led between GRIFFITH her gentleman usher and PATIENCE her woman,12
O Griffith sick to death!,12
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:,12
Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou led'st me,12
Yes madam; but I think your grace,12
Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died:,12
For my example.,12
For after the stout Earl Northumberland,12
As a man sorely tainted to his answer,12
He could not sit his mule.,12
At last with easy roads he came to Leicester,12
With all his covent honourably received him;,12
An old man broken with the storms of state,12
Give him a little earth for charity!',12
Pursued him still: and three nights after this,12
Foretold should be his last full of repentance,12
He gave his honours to the world again,12
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!,12
And yet with charity. He was a man,12
Himself with princes; one that by suggestion,12
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence,12
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,12
His promises were as he then was mighty;,12
Of his own body he was ill and gave,12
Noble madam,12
We write in water. May it please your highness,12
Yes good Griffith;,12
This cardinal,12
Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.,12
Exceeding wise fair-spoken and persuading:,12
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.,12
Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam,12
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,12
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;,12
So excellent in art and still so rising,12
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;,12
And found the blessedness of being little:,12
Than man could give him he died fearing God.,12
No other speaker of my living actions,12
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.,12
With thy religious truth and modesty,12
Patience be near me still; and set me lower:,12
Cause the musicians play me that sad note,12
On that celestial harmony I go to.,12
She is asleep: good wench let's sit down quiet,12
The vision. Enter solemnly tripping one after  another six personages clad in white robes  wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden  vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her then  dance; and at certain changes the first two hold  a spare garland over her head; at which the other  four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two  who observe the same order in their changes and  holding the garland over her head: which done  they deliver the same garland to the last two who  likewise observe the same order: at which as it  were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them. The music continues,12
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?,12
It is not you I call for:,12
None madam.,12
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces,12
They promised me eternal happiness;,12
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall assuredly.,12
Possess your fancy.,12
They are harsh and heavy to me.,12
Do you note,12
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,12
She is going wench: pray pray.,12
Enter a Messenger,12
You are a saucy fellow:,12
You are to blame,12
To use so rude behavior; go to kneel.,12
My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying,12
Admit him entrance Griffith: but this fellow,12
Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger,12
If my sight fail not,12
My royal nephew and your name Capucius.,12
O my lord,12
With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,12
Noble lady,12
The king's request that I would visit you;,12
Sends you his princely commendations,12
O my good lord that comfort comes too late;,12
That gentle physic given in time had cured me;,12
How does his highness?,12
So may he ever do! and ever flourish,12
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience is that letter,12
No madam.,12
Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver,12
Most willing madam.,12
The model of our chaste loves his young daughter;,12
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--,12
I hope she will deserve well--and a little,12
Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition,12
Upon my wretched women that so long,12
Of which there is not one I dare avow,12
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,12
A right good husband let him be a noble,12
The last is for my men; they are the poorest,12
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,12
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life,12
These are the whole contents: and good my lord,12
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,12
To do me this last right.,12
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!,12
In all humility unto his highness:,12
Out of this world; tell him in death I bless'd him,12
My lord. Griffith farewell. Nay Patience,12
Call in more women. When I am dead good wench,12
With maiden flowers that all the world may know,12
Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd yet like,12
I can no more.,12
ACT V,12
Enter GARDINER Bishop of Winchester a Page with a torch before him met by LOVELL,12
It hath struck.,12
Not for delights; times to repair our nature,12
To waste these times. Good hour of night Sir Thomas!,12
Came you from the king my lord,12
With the Duke of Suffolk.,12
Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.,12
It seems you are in haste: an if there be,12
Some touch of your late business: affairs that walk,12
In them a wilder nature than the business,12
My lord I love you;,12
Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,12
She'll with the labour end.,12
I pray for heartily that it may find,12
I wish it grubb'd up now.,12
Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says,12
Deserve our better wishes.,12
Hear me Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman,12
And let me tell you it will ne'er be well,12
Till Cranmer Cromwell her two hands and she,12
Now sir you speak of two,12
Beside that of the jewel house is made master,12
Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,12
Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak,12
Yes yes Sir Thomas,12
To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,12
Incensed the lords o' the council that he is,12
A most arch heretic a pestilence,12
Have broken with the king; who hath so far,12
And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs,12
To-morrow morning to the council-board,12
And we must root him out. From your affairs,12
Many good nights my lord: I rest your servant.,12
Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK,12
My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.,12
But little Charles;,12
Now Lovell from the queen what is the news?,12
What you commanded me but by her woman,12
In the great'st humbleness and desired your highness,12
What say'st thou ha?,12
So said her woman; and that her sufferance made,12
Alas good lady!,12
With gentle travail to the gladding of,12
Tis midnight Charles;,12
The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;,12
Would not be friendly to.,12
A quiet night; and my good mistress will,12
Charles good night.,12
Enter DENNY,12
Sir I have brought my lord the archbishop,12
Ha! Canterbury?,12
Tis true: where is he Denny?,12
Exit DENNY,12
I am happily come hither.,12
Avoid the gallery.,12
Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!,12
[Aside],12
Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.,12
Wherefore I sent for you.,12
To attend your highness' pleasure.,12
My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.,12
I have news to tell you: come come give me your hand.,12
And am right sorry to repeat what follows,12
Heard many grievous I do say my lord,12
Have moved us and our council that you shall,12
You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,12
Which will require your answer you must take,12
To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,12
Would come against you.,12
I humbly thank your highness;,12
Most throughly to be winnow'd where my chaff,12
There's none stands under more calumnious tongues,12
Stand up good Canterbury:,12
In us thy friend: give me thy hand stand up:,12
What manner of man are you? My lord I look'd,12
I should have ta'en some pains to bring together,12
Without indurance further.,12
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:,12
Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,12
What can be said against me.,12
How your state stands i' the world with the whole world?,12
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever,12
The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease,12
To swear against you? such things have been done.,12
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,12
Whose minister you are whiles here he lived,12
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,12
God and your majesty,12
The trap is laid for me!,12
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.,12
You do appear before them: if they shall chance,12
The best persuasions to the contrary,12
The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties,12
Deliver them and your appeal to us,12
He's honest on mine honour. God's blest mother!,12
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,12
Exit CRANMER,12
His language in his tears.,12
[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?,12
Will make my boldness manners. Now good angels,12
Under their blessed wings!,12
I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?,12
Ay ay my liege;,12
Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,12
Desires your visitation and to be,12
As cherry is to cherry.,12
Sir?,12
Exit,12
An ordinary groom is for such payment.,12
Said I for this the girl was like to him?,12
While it is hot I'll put it to the issue.,12
SCENE II. Before the council-chamber. Pursuivants Pages  and c.,12
Enter CRANMER,12
That was sent to me from the council pray'd me,12
Who waits there? Sure you know me?,12
Yes my lord;,12
Why?,12
Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.,12
[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad,12
Shall understand it presently.,12
[Aside] 'Tis Butts,12
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!,12
This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--,12
To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me,12
Mong boys grooms and lackeys. But their pleasures,12
Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above,12
What's that Butts?,12
Body o' me where is it?,12
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;,12
Pages and footboys.,12
Is this the honour they do one another?,12
They had parted so much honesty among 'em,12
A man of his place and so near our favour,12
And at the door too like a post with packets.,12
Let 'em alone and draw the curtain close:,12
Exeunt,12
Enter Chancellor; places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand; a seat being left  void above him as for CRANMER's seat. SUFFOLK  NORFOLK SURREY Chamberlain GARDINER seat  themselves in order on each side. CROMWELL at lower end as secretary. Keeper at the door,12
Why are we met in council?,12
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.,12
Yes.,12
Without my noble lords?,12
My lord archbishop;,12
Let him come in.,12
CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table,12
To sit here at this present and behold,12
In our own natures frail and capable,12
And want of wisdom you that best should teach us,12
Toward the king first then his laws in filling,12
For so we are inform'd with new opinions,12
And not reform'd may prove pernicious.,12
My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses,12
But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur 'em,12
Out of our easiness and childish pity,12
Farewell all physic: and what follows then?,12
Of the whole state: as of late days our neighbours,12
Yet freshly pitied in our memories.,12
Both of my life and office I have labour'd,12
And the strong course of my authority,12
Was ever to do well: nor is there living,12
A man that more detests more stirs against,12
Defacers of a public peace than I do.,12
With less allegiance in it! Men that make,12
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,12
Be what they will may stand forth face to face,12
Nay my lord,12
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.,12
We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,12
From hence you be committed to the Tower;,12
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,12
Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you;,12
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,12
Tis my undoing: love and meekness lord,12
Win straying souls with modesty again,12
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,12
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,12
My lord my lord you are a sectary,12
To men that understand you words and weakness.,12
By your good favour too sharp; men so noble,12
For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty,12
Good master secretary,12
Of all this table say so.,12
Do not I know you for a favourer,12
Not sound?,12
Would you were half so honest!,12
I shall remember this bold language.,12
Remember your bold life too.,12
Forbear for shame my lords.,12
And I.,12
I take it by all voices that forthwith,12
There to remain till the king's further pleasure,12
We are.,12
But I must needs to the Tower my lords?,12
Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.,12
Enter Guard,12
Must I go like a traitor thither?,12
And see him safe i' the Tower.,12
I have a little yet to say. Look there my lords;,12
Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it,12
This is the king's ring.,12
Tis the right ring by heaven: I told ye all,12
Twould fall upon ourselves.,12
The king will suffer but the little finger,12
Tis now too certain:,12
Would I were fairly out on't!,12
In seeking tales and informations,12
And his disciples only envy at,12
Enter KING frowning on them; takes his seat,12
In daily thanks that gave us such a prince;,12
One that in all obedience makes the church,12
That holy duty out of dear respect,12
The cause betwixt her and this great offender.,12
Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not,12
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.,12
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;,12
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.,12
Good man sit down. Now let me see the proudest,12
By all that's holy he had better starve,12
May it please your grace--,12
I had thought I had had men of some understanding,12
Was it discretion lords to let this man,12
This honest man wait like a lousy footboy,12
Why what a shame was this! Did my commission,12
Power as he was a counsellor to try him,12
More out of malice than integrity,12
Which ye shall never have while I live.,12
My most dread sovereign may it like your grace,12
Concerning his imprisonment was rather,12
And fair purgation to the world than malice,12
Well well my lords respect him;,12
I will say thus much for him if a prince,12
Am for his love and service so to him.,12
Be friends for shame my lords! My Lord of,12
I have a suit which you must not deny me;,12
You must be godfather and answer for her.,12
In such an honour: how may I deserve it,12
Come come my lord you'ld spare your spoons: you,12
Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset: will,12
Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you,12
With a true heart,12
And let heaven,12
Good man those joyful tears show thy true heart:,12
Of thee which says thus 'Do my Lord of Canterbury,12
Come lords we trifle time away; I long,12
As I have made ye one lords one remain;,12
Exeunt,12
Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man,12
take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,12
Within,12
Belong to the gallows and be hanged ye rogue! is,12
staves and strong ones: these are but switches to,12
christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,12
Pray sir be patient: 'tis as much impossible--,12
To scatter 'em as 'tis to make 'em sleep,12
We may as well push against Powle's as stir em.,12
Alas I know not; how gets the tide in?,12
You see the poor remainder--could distribute,12
You did nothing sir.,12
To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any,12
He or she cuckold or cuckold-maker,12
And that I would not for a cow God save her!,12
Do you hear master porter?,12
Keep the door close sirrah.,12
What should you do but knock 'em down by the,12
we some strange Indian with the great tool come to,12
fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian,12
thousand; here will be father godfather and all together.,12
fellow somewhat near the door he should be a,12
of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand,12
penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on,12
against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece to,12
wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked,12
combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,12
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to,12
she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my,12
me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of,12
of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in,12
em I think surely.,12
and fight for bitten apples; that no audience but,12
Limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure.,12
are like to dance these three days; besides the,12
Enter Chamberlain,12
They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,12
These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand fellows:,12
Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have,12
When they pass back from the christening.,12
your honour,12
Not being torn a-pieces we have done:,12
As I live,12
By the heels and suddenly; and on your heads,12
And here ye lie baiting of bombards when,12
They're come already from the christening:,12
To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find,12
Make way there for the princess.,12
Stand close up or I'll make your head ache.,12
I'll peck you o'er the pales else.,12
SCENE V. The palace.,12
Heaven from thy endless goodness send prosperous,12
princess of England Elizabeth!,12
[Kneeling] And to your royal grace and the good queen,12
All comfort joy in this most gracious lady,12
May hourly fall upon ye!,12
What is her name?,12
Stand up lord.,12
With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!,12
Amen.,12
I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,12
Let me speak sir,12
Let none think flattery for they'll find 'em truth.,12
Though in her cradle yet now promises,12
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--,12
A pattern to all princes living with her,12
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue,12
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,12
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,12
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;,12
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:,12
Under his own vine what he plants; and sing,12
God shall be truly known; and those about her,12
And by those claim their greatness not by blood.,12
The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix,12
As great in admiration as herself;,12
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,12
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,12
That were the servants to this chosen infant,12
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,12
Shall be and make new nations: he shall flourish,12
To all the plains about him: our children's children,12
Thou speakest wonders.,12
An aged princess; many days shall see her,12
Would I had known no more! but she must die,12
A most unspotted lily shall she pass,12
O lord archbishop,12
This happy child did I get any thing:,12
That when I am in heaven I shall desire,12
I thank ye all. To you my good lord mayor,12
I have received much honour by your presence,12
Ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye,12
Has business at his house; for all shall stay:,12
Exeunt,12
Tis ten to one this play can never please,12
And sleep an act or two; but those we fear,12
They'll say 'tis naught: others to hear the city,12
Which we have not done neither: that I fear,12
For this play at this time is only in,12
For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,12
All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,12
ACT I,13
Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR PEMBROKE ESSEX SALISBURY and others with CHATILLON,13
Thus after greeting speaks the King of France,13
The borrow'd majesty of England here.,13
Silence good mother; hear the embassy.,13
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,13
To this fair island and the territories,13
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword,13
And put these same into young Arthur's hand,13
What follows if we disallow of this?,13
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.,13
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.,13
The farthest limit of my embassy.,13
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;,13
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:,13
And sullen presage of your own decay.,13
Pembroke look to 't. Farewell Chatillon.,13
What now my son! have I not ever said,13
Till she had kindled France and all the world,13
This might have been prevented and made whole,13
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must,13
Our strong possession and our right for us.,13
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:,13
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.,13
My liege here is the strangest controversy,13
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?,13
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay,13
Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD,13
Your faithful subject I a gentleman,13
As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge,13
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.,13
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.,13
You came not of one mother then it seems.,13
That is well known; and as I think one father:,13
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:,13
Out on thee rude man! thou dost shame thy mother,13
I madam? no I have no reason for it;,13
The which if he can prove a' pops me out,13
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!,13
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?,13
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:,13
That still I lay upon my mother's head,13
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--,13
If old sir Robert did beget us both,13
O old sir Robert father on my knee,13
Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!,13
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.,13
In the large composition of this man?,13
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah speak,13
Because he hath a half-face like my father.,13
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!,13
Your brother did employ my father much--,13
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.,13
To Germany there with the emperor,13
The advantage of his absence took the king,13
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,13
Between my father and my mother lay,13
When this same lusty gentleman was got.,13
His lands to me and took it on his death,13
And if he were he came into the world,13
Then good my liege let me have what is mine,13
Sirrah your brother is legitimate;,13
And if she did play false the fault was hers;,13
That marry wives. Tell me how if my brother,13
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?,13
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;,13
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,13
My mother's son did get your father's heir;,13
Shall then my father's will be of no force,13
Of no more force to dispossess me sir,13
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,13
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,13
Madam an if my brother had my shape,13
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,13
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,13
And to his shape were heir to all this land,13
I would give it every foot to have this face;,13
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,13
I am a soldier and now bound to France.,13
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,13
Madam I'll follow you unto the death.,13
Our country manners give our betters way.,13
Philip my liege so is my name begun,13
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:,13
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.,13
My father gave me honour yours gave land.,13
When I was got sir Robert was away!,13
I am thy grandam Richard; call me so.,13
Something about a little from the right,13
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,13
Near or far off well won is still well shot,13
Go Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;,13
Come madam and come Richard we must speed,13
Brother adieu: good fortune come to thee!,13
Exeunt all but BASTARD,13
But many a many foot of land the worse.,13
Good den sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy fellow!'--,13
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;,13
For your conversion. Now your traveller,13
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,13
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir',13
I shall beseech you'--that is question now;,13
O sir' says answer 'at your best command;,13
No sir' says question 'I sweet sir at yours:',13
Saving in dialogue of compliment,13
The Pyrenean and the river Po,13
But this is worshipful society,13
For he is but a bastard to the time,13
And so am I whether I smack or no;,13
Exterior form outward accoutrement,13
Sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth:,13
Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn;,13
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?,13
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?,13
O me! it is my mother. How now good lady!,13
Where is that slave thy brother? where is he,13
My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?,13
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?,13
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?,13
James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile?,13
Philip! sparrow: James,13
Exit GURNEY,13
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me,13
Sir Robert could do well: marry to confess,13
We know his handiwork: therefore good mother,13
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.,13
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?,13
Knight knight good mother Basilisco-like.,13
But mother I am not sir Robert's son;,13
Legitimation name and all is gone:,13
Some proper man I hope: who was it mother?,13
As faithfully as I deny the devil.,13
By long and vehement suit I was seduced,13
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!,13
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.,13
Madam I would not wish a better father.,13
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:,13
Subjected tribute to commanding love,13
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,13
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts,13
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!,13
When I was got I'll send his soul to hell.,13
And they shall say when Richard me begot,13
Who says it was he lies; I say 'twas not.,13
ACT II,13
Enter AUSTRIA and forces drums etc. on one side:  on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS ARTHUR CONSTANCE and attendants,13
Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood,13
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,13
And for amends to his posterity,13
To spread his colours boy in thy behalf,13
Of thy unnatural uncle English John:,13
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death,13
Shadowing their right under your wings of war:,13
But with a heart full of unstained love:,13
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?,13
As seal to this indenture of my love,13
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,13
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides,13
Even till that England hedged in with the main,13
And confident from foreign purposes,13
Salute thee for her king: till then fair boy,13
O take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks,13
To make a more requital to your love!,13
In such a just and charitable war.,13
Against the brows of this resisting town.,13
To cull the plots of best advantages:,13
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,13
Stay for an answer to your embassy,13
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,13
And then we shall repent each drop of blood,13
Enter CHATILLON,13
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!,13
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon speak.,13
And stir them up against a mightier task.,13
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,13
To land his legions all as soon as I;,13
His forces strong his soldiers confident.,13
An Ate stirring him to blood and strife;,13
With them a bastard of the king's deceased,13
Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries,13
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,13
To make hazard of new fortunes here:,13
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er,13
To do offence and scath in Christendom.,13
The interruption of their churlish drums,13
To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.,13
By how much unexpected by so much,13
For courage mounteth with occasion:,13
Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR BLANCH the BASTARD Lords and forces,13
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;,13
Whiles we God's wrathful agent do correct,13
Peace be to England if that war return,13
England we love; and for that England's sake,13
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;,13
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,13
Out-faced infant state and done a rape,13
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;,13
This little abstract doth contain that large,13
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.,13
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right,13
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,13
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?,13
To draw my answer from thy articles?,13
In any breast of strong authority,13
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:,13
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.,13
Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.,13
Let me make answer; thy usurping son.,13
That thou mayst be a queen and cheque the world!,13
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy,13
Than thou and John in manners; being as like,13
My boy a bastard! By my soul I think,13
It cannot be an if thou wert his mother.,13
There's a good grandam boy that would blot thee.,13
Hear the crier.,13
One that will play the devil sir with you,13
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,13
I'll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right;,13
O well did he become that lion's robe,13
It lies as sightly on the back of him,13
But ass I'll take that burthen from your back,13
What craker is this same that deafs our ears,13
Lewis determine what we shall do straight.,13
King John this is the very sum of all;,13
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:,13
My life as soon: I do defy thee France.,13
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more,13
Submit thee boy.,13
Do child go to it grandam child:,13
Give it a plum a cherry and a fig:,13
Good my mother peace!,13
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.,13
Now shame upon you whether she does or no!,13
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,13
Ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed,13
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!,13
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp,13
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,13
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;,13
Being but the second generation,13
Bedlam have done.,13
That he is not only plagued for her sin,13
On this removed issue plague for her,13
Her injury the beadle to her sin,13
And all for her; a plague upon her!,13
A will that bars the title of thy son.,13
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!,13
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim,13
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls,13
Whose title they admit Arthur's or John's.,13
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?,13
England for itself.,13
You loving men of Angiers Arthur's subjects,13
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.,13
Before the eye and prospect of your town,13
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,13
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:,13
All merciless proceeding by these French,13
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,13
By the compulsion of their ordinance,13
Had been dishabited and wide havoc made,13
But on the sight of us your lawful king,13
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,13
Behold the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;,13
To make a shaking fever in your walls,13
To make a faithless error in your ears:,13
And let us in your king whose labour'd spirits,13
Crave harbourage within your city walls.,13
Lo in this right hand whose protection,13
Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet,13
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:,13
In warlike march these greens before your town,13
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal,13
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then,13
To that owes it namely this young prince:,13
Save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up;,13
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;,13
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,13
Which here we came to spout against your town,13
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,13
Can hide you from our messengers of war,13
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.,13
In that behalf which we have challenged it?,13
And stalk in blood to our possession?,13
For him and in his right we hold this town.,13
That can we not; but he that proves the king,13
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.,13
And if not that I bring you witnesses,13
Bastards and else.,13
As many and as well-born bloods as those--,13
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.,13
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.,13
That to their everlasting residence,13
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!,13
Saint George that swinged the dragon and e'er since,13
Teach us some fence!,13
Sirrah were I at home,13
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,13
Peace! no more.,13
Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth,13
Speed then to take advantage of the field.,13
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!,13
Here after excursions enter the Herald of France with trumpets to the gates,13
And let young Arthur Duke of Bretagne in,13
Much work for tears in many an English mother,13
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,13
And victory with little loss doth play,13
Who are at hand triumphantly display'd,13
Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.,13
Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells:,13
Commander of this hot malicious day:,13
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;,13
That is removed by a staff of France;,13
That did display them when we first march'd forth;,13
Our lusty English all with purpled hands,13
Open your gates and gives the victors way.,13
From first to last the onset and retire,13
By our best eyes cannot be censured:,13
Strength match'd with strength and power confronted power:,13
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,13
Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP with their powers severally,13
Say shall the current of our right run on?,13
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell,13
Unless thou let his silver water keep,13
England thou hast not saved one drop of blood,13
Rather lost more. And by this hand I swear,13
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,13
Or add a royal number to the dead,13
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.,13
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!,13
The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs;,13
In undetermined differences of kings.,13
Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,13
Then let confusion of one part confirm,13
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?,13
The king of England; when we know the king.,13
In us that are our own great deputy,13
Lord of our presence Angiers and of you.,13
And till it be undoubted we do lock,13
King'd of our fears until our fears resolved,13
By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings,13
As in a theatre whence they gape and point,13
Your royal presences be ruled by me:,13
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend,13
By east and west let France and England mount,13
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down,13
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,13
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.,13
And part your mingled colours once again;,13
Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth,13
To whom in favour she shall give the day,13
How like you this wild counsel mighty states?,13
Now by the sky that hangs above our heads,13
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;,13
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,13
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,13
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,13
Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell.,13
We from the west will send destruction,13
I from the north.,13
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.,13
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:,13
Hear us great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,13
Win you this city without stroke or wound;,13
That here come sacrifices for the field:,13
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.,13
Is niece to England: look upon the years,13
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,13
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,13
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,13
Such as she is in beauty virtue birth,13
If not complete of say he is not she;,13
If want it be not that she is not he:,13
Left to be finished by such as she;,13
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.,13
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;,13
Two such controlling bounds shall you be kings,13
This union shall do more than battery can,13
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,13
And give you entrance: but without this match,13
Lions more confident mountains and rocks,13
In moral fury half so peremptory,13
Here's a stay,13
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth indeed,13
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions,13
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?,13
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:,13
But buffets better than a fist of France:,13
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.,13
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:,13
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,13
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.,13
Mark how they whisper: urge them while their souls,13
Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath,13
Cool and congeal again to what it was.,13
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?,13
To speak unto this city: what say you?,13
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love',13
For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers,13
Except this city now by us besieged,13
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich,13
As she in beauty education blood,13
What say'st thou boy? look in the lady's face.,13
A wonder or a wondrous miracle,13
Which being but the shadow of your son,13
I do protest I never loved myself,13
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.,13
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!,13
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy,13
That hang'd and drawn and quartered there should be,13
My uncle's will in this respect is mine:,13
That any thing he sees which moves his liking,13
Or if you will to speak more properly,13
Further I will not flatter you my lord,13
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,13
That I can find should merit any hate.,13
That she is bound in honour still to do,13
Speak then prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?,13
For I do love her most unfeignedly.,13
Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces,13
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.,13
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.,13
And your lips too; for I am well assured,13
Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates,13
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently,13
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?,13
Her presence would have interrupted much:,13
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.,13
Will give her sadness very little cure.,13
This widow lady? In her right we came;,13
To our own vantage.,13
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne,13
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;,13
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,13
Yet in some measure satisfy her so,13
Go we as well as haste will suffer us,13
Exeunt all but the BASTARD,13
John to stop Arthur's title in the whole,13
And France whose armour conscience buckled on,13
As God's own soldier rounded in the ear,13
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,13
Of kings of beggars old men young men maids,13
But the word 'maid' cheats the poor maid of that,13
Commodity the bias of the world,13
Made to run even upon even ground,13
This sway of motion this Commodity,13
From all direction purpose course intent:,13
This bawd this broker this all-changing word,13
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,13
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.,13
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:,13
When his fair angels would salute my palm;,13
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.,13
And say there is no sin but to be rich;,13
To say there is no vice but beggary.,13
Gain be my lord for I will worship thee.,13
ACT III,13
Enter CONSTANCE ARTHUR and SALISBURY,13
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!,13
It is not so; thou hast misspoke misheard:,13
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:,13
Is but the vain breath of a common man:,13
I have a king's oath to the contrary.,13
For I am sick and capable of fears,13
A widow husbandless subject to fears,13
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,13
But they will quake and tremble all this day.,13
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?,13
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,13
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?,13
But this one word whether thy tale be true.,13
That give you cause to prove my saying true.,13
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,13
As doth the fury of two desperate men,13
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy then where art thou?,13
Fellow be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:,13
What other harm have I good lady done,13
Which harm within itself so heinous is,13
I do beseech you madam be content.,13
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,13
Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious,13
I would not care I then would be content,13
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.,13
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:,13
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune O,13
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,13
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,13
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,13
Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn?,13
And leave those woes alone which I alone,13
Pardon me madam,13
Thou mayst thou shalt; I will not go with thee:,13
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.,13
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great,13
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;,13
Seats herself on the ground,13
Tis true fair daughter; and this blessed day,13
To solemnize this day the glorious sun,13
Turning with splendor of his precious eye,13
The yearly course that brings this day about,13
A wicked day and not a holy day!,13
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,13
Among the high tides in the calendar?,13
This day of shame oppression perjury.,13
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,13
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;,13
This day all things begun come to ill end,13
By heaven lady you shall have no cause,13
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?,13
Resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried,13
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,13
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war,13
And our oppression hath made up this league.,13
A widow cries; be husband to me heavens!,13
Wear out the day in peace; but ere sunset,13
Hear me O hear me!,13
War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war,13
That bloody spoil: thou slave thou wretch thou coward!,13
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!,13
But when her humorous ladyship is by,13
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,13
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,13
Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend,13
And dost thou now fall over to my fores?,13
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.,13
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.,13
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.,13
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH,13
Hail you anointed deputies of heaven!,13
I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal,13
Do in his name religiously demand,13
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce,13
Of Canterbury from that holy see?,13
Pope Innocent I do demand of thee.,13
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?,13
So slight unworthy and ridiculous,13
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England,13
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;,13
So under Him that great supremacy,13
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:,13
To him and his usurp'd authority.,13
Though you and all the kings of Christendom,13
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;,13
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,13
Though you and all the rest so grossly led,13
Yet I alone alone do me oppose,13
Then by the lawful power that I have,13
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt,13
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,13
That takes away by any secret course,13
O lawful let it be,13
Good father cardinal cry thou amen,13
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.,13
And for mine too: when law can do no right,13
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,13
Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong,13
Philip of France on peril of a curse,13
And raise the power of France upon his head,13
Look'st thou pale France? do not let go thy hand.,13
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.,13
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.,13
Your breeches best may carry them.,13
What should he say but as the cardinal?,13
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,13
Forego the easier.,13
O Lewis stand fast! the devil tempts thee here,13
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,13
O if thou grant my need,13
That need must needs infer this principle,13
O then tread down my need and faith mounts up;,13
The king is moved and answers not to this.,13
Do so King Philip; hang no more in doubt.,13
I am perplex'd and know not what to say.,13
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?,13
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.,13
And the conjunction of our inward souls,13
With all religious strength of sacred vows;,13
Was deep-sworn faith peace amity true love,13
And even before this truce but new before,13
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,13
With slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint,13
And shall these hands so lately purged of blood,13
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?,13
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,13
Unswear faith sworn and on the marriage-bed,13
And make a riot on the gentle brow,13
My reverend father let it not be so!,13
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest,13
All form is formless order orderless,13
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,13
A mother's curse on her revolting son.,13
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,13
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.,13
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;,13
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O let thy vow,13
That is to be the champion of our church!,13
And may not be performed by thyself,13
Is not amiss when it is truly done,13
The truth is then most done not doing it:,13
Is to mistake again; though indirect,13
And falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire,13
It is religion that doth make vows kept;,13
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,13
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure,13
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!,13
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.,13
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;,13
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts,13
Upon which better part our prayers come in,13
The peril of our curses light on thee,13
But in despair die under their black weight.,13
Will't not be?,13
Father to arms!,13
Against the blood that thou hast married?,13
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,13
O husband hear me! ay alack how new,13
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,13
Against mine uncle.,13
Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee,13
Forethought by heaven!,13
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?,13
His honour: O thine honour Lewis thine honour!,13
When such profound respects do pull you on.,13
Thou shalt not need. England I will fall from thee.,13
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!,13
Old Time the clock-setter that bald sexton Time,13
The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day adieu!,13
I am with both: each army hath a hand;,13
They swirl asunder and dismember me.,13
Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;,13
Grandam I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:,13
Assured loss before the match be play'd.,13
There where my fortune lives there my life dies.,13
Exit BASTARD,13
A rage whose heat hath this condition,13
The blood and dearest-valued blood of France.,13
To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire:,13
No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!,13
SCENE II. The same. Plains near Angiers.,13
Now by my life this day grows wondrous hot;,13
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,13
Enter KING JOHN ARTHUR and HUBERT,13
My mother is assailed in our tent,13
My lord I rescued her;,13
But on my liege; for very little pains,13
Exeunt,13
Alarums excursions retreat. Enter KING JOHN  QUEEN ELINOR ARTHUR the BASTARD HUBERT and Lords,13
stay behind,13
To ARTHUR,13
Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will,13
O this will make my mother die with grief!,13
haste before:,13
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels,13
Must by the hungry now be fed upon:,13
Bell book and candle shall not drive me back,13
I leave your highness. Grandam I will pray,13
For your fair safety; so I kiss your hand.,13
Coz farewell.,13
Come hither little kinsman; hark a word.,13
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh,13
And with advantage means to pay thy love:,13
Lives in this bosom dearly cherished.,13
But I will fit it with some better time.,13
To say what good respect I have of thee.,13
Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet,13
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.,13
The sun is in the heaven and the proud day,13
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds,13
Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,13
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,13
Or if that surly spirit melancholy,13
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,13
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,13
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,13
Without a tongue using conceit alone,13
Then in despite of brooded watchful day,13
But ah I will not! yet I love thee well;,13
So well that what you bid me undertake,13
By heaven I would do it.,13
Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye,13
He is a very serpent in my way;,13
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?,13
And I'll keep him so,13
Death.,13
A grave.,13
Enough.,13
Well I'll not say what I intend for thee:,13
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.,13
For England cousin go:,13
With all true duty. On toward Calais ho!,13
SCENE IV. The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.,13
So by a roaring tempest on the flood,13
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.,13
What can go well when we have run so ill?,13
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?,13
O'erbearing interruption spite of France?,13
So hot a speed with such advice disposed,13
Doth want example: who hath read or heard,13
Well could I bear that England had this praise,13
Enter CONSTANCE,13
Holding the eternal spirit against her will,13
I prithee lady go away with me.,13
Patience good lady! comfort gentle Constance!,13
But that which ends all counsel true redress,13
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!,13
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,13
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,13
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,13
Come grin on me and I will think thou smilest,13
O come to me!,13
No no I will not having breath to cry:,13
Then with a passion would I shake the world;,13
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,13
Lady you utter madness and not sorrow.,13
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;,13
Young Arthur is my son and he is lost:,13
For then 'tis like I should forget myself:,13
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,13
For being not mad but sensible of grief,13
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,13
If I were mad I should forget my son,13
I am not mad; too well too well I feel,13
Bind up those tresses. O what love I note,13
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,13
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,13
Sticking together in calamity.,13
Bind up your hairs.,13
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud,13
As they have given these hairs their liberty!',13
And will again commit them to their bonds,13
And father cardinal I have heard you say,13
If that be true I shall see my boy again;,13
To him that did but yesterday suspire,13
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud,13
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,13
And so he'll die; and rising so again,13
I shall not know him: therefore never never,13
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.,13
You are as fond of grief as of your child.,13
Lies in his bed walks up and down with me,13
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,13
Then have I reason to be fond of grief?,13
I could give better comfort than you do.,13
When there is such disorder in my wit.,13
My life my joy my food my all the world!,13
Exit,13
Exit,13
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,13
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,13
Before the curing of a strong disease,13
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,13
What have you lost by losing of this day?,13
If you had won it certainly you had.,13
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.,13
In this which he accounts so clearly won:,13
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.,13
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;,13
Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub,13
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.,13
That whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,13
One minute nay one quiet breath of rest.,13
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;,13
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:,13
So be it for it cannot be but so.,13
You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,13
And lose it life and all as Arthur did.,13
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;,13
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.,13
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,13
To cheque his reign but they will cherish it;,13
No scope of nature no distemper'd day,13
But they will pluck away his natural cause,13
Abortives presages and tongues of heaven,13
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,13
O sir when he shall hear of your approach,13
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts,13
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,13
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.,13
And O what better matter breeds for you,13
Is now in England ransacking the church,13
Were there in arms they would be as a call,13
Or as a little snow tumbled about,13
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful,13
Now that their souls are topful of offence.,13
Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:,13
Exeunt,13
SCENE I. A room in a castle.,13
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand,13
Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth,13
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence and watch.,13
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.,13
Young lad come forth; I have to say with you.,13
Good morrow Hubert.,13
As little prince having so great a title,13
Indeed I have been merrier.,13
Methinks no body should be sad but I:,13
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,13
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,13
And so I would be here but that I doubt,13
He is afraid of me and I of him:,13
No indeed is't not; and I would to heaven,13
[Aside]  If I talk to him with his innocent prate,13
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.,13
In sooth I would you were a little sick,13
I warrant I love you more than you do me.,13
Read here young Arthur.,13
Aside,13
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!,13
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.,13
Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect:,13
Young boy I must.,13
And I will.,13
I knit my handercher about your brows,13
And I did never ask it you again;,13
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,13
Saying 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?',13
Many a poor man's son would have lien still,13
But you at your sick service had a prince.,13
And call it cunning: do an if you will:,13
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?,13
So much as frown on you.,13
And with hot irons must I burn them out.,13
The iron of itself though heat red-hot,13
And quench his fiery indignation,13
Nay after that consume away in rust,13
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?,13
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,13
Come forth.,13
Re-enter Executioners with a cord irons  and c,13
O save me Hubert save me! my eyes are out,13
Give me the iron I say and bind him here.,13
I will not struggle I will stand stone-still.,13
Nay hear me Hubert drive these men away,13
I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word,13
Thrust but these men away and I'll forgive you,13
Go stand within; let me alone with him.,13
Exeunt Executioners,13
He hath a stern look but a gentle heart:,13
Give life to yours.,13
Is there no remedy?,13
O heaven that there were but a mote in yours,13
Any annoyance in that precious sense!,13
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.,13
Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues,13
Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert;,13
So I may keep mine eyes: O spare mine eyes.,13
Lo by my truth the instrument is cold,13
I can heat it boy.,13
Being create for comfort to be used,13
There is no malice in this burning coal;,13
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.,13
An if you do you will but make it blush,13
Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;,13
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.,13
Deny their office: only you do lack,13
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.,13
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:,13
With this same very iron to burn them out.,13
You were disguised.,13
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;,13
And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure,13
Will not offend thee.,13
Silence; no more: go closely in with me:,13
Exeunt,13
Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other Lords,13
And looked upon I hope with cheerful eyes.,13
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,13
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;,13
With any long'd-for change or better state.,13
To guard a title that was rich before,13
To throw a perfume on the violet,13
Unto the rainbow or with taper-light,13
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.,13
This act is as an ancient tale new told,13
Being urged at a time unseasonable.,13
Of plain old form is much disfigured;,13
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,13
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,13
When workmen strive to do better than well,13
And oftentimes excusing of a fault,13
As patches set upon a little breach,13
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.,13
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness,13
Since all and every part of what we would,13
Some reasons of this double coronation,13
And more more strong then lesser is my fear,13
What you would have reform'd that is not well,13
I will both hear and grant you your requests.,13
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,13
Your safety for the which myself and them,13
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint,13
To break into this dangerous argument--,13
Why then your fears which as they say attend,13
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days,13
The rich advantage of good exercise?,13
To grace occasions let it be our suit,13
Which for our goods we do no further ask,13
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.,13
Let it be so: I do commit his youth,13
Taking him apart,13
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:,13
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his,13
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,13
The colour of the king doth come and go,13
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:,13
And when it breaks I fear will issue thence,13
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:,13
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:,13
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.,13
Before the child himself felt he was sick:,13
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?,13
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?,13
That greatness should so grossly offer it:,13
Stay yet Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,13
His little kingdom of a forced grave.,13
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!,13
To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt.,13
They burn in indignation. I repent:,13
No certain life achieved by others' death.,13
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood,13
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:,13
From France to England. Never such a power,13
Was levied in the body of a land.,13
For when you should be told they do prepare,13
O where hath our intelligence been drunk?,13
That such an army could be drawn in France,13
My liege her ear,13
Your noble mother: and as I hear my lord,13
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue,13
Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion!,13
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!,13
Under whose conduct came those powers of France,13
Under the Dauphin.,13
With these ill tidings.,13
Now what says the world,13
My head with more ill news for it is full.,13
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.,13
Under the tide: but now I breathe again,13
To any tongue speak it of what it will.,13
The sums I have collected shall express.,13
I find the people strangely fantasied;,13
Not knowing what they fear but full of fear:,13
From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found,13
To whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,13
Your highness should deliver up your crown.,13
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.,13
And on that day at noon whereon he says,13
Deliver him to safety; and return,13
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER,13
Hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived?,13
Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,13
And others more going to seek the grave,13
On your suggestion.,13
And thrust thyself into their companies:,13
Bring them before me.,13
Nay but make haste; the better foot before.,13
When adverse foreigners affright my towns,13
Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels,13
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.,13
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.,13
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;,13
With all my heart my liege.,13
My mother dead!,13
My lord they say five moons were seen to-night;,13
The other four in wondrous motion.,13
Old men and beldams in the streets,13
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:,13
And whisper one another in the ear;,13
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,13
I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus,13
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;,13
Standing on slippers which his nimble haste,13
Told of a many thousand warlike French,13
Another lean unwash'd artificer,13
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?,13
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause,13
No had my lord! why did you not provoke me?,13
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant,13
And on the winking of authority,13
Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns,13
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.,13
Is to be made then shall this hand and seal,13
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds,13
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,13
This murder had not come into my mind:,13
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,13
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;,13
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.,13
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause,13
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,13
Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off,13
But thou didst understand me by my signs,13
Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent,13
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.,13
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,13
Nay in the body of this fleshly land,13
Hostility and civil tumult reigns,13
Arm you against your other enemies,13
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine,13
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.,13
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;,13
Which howsoever rude exteriorly,13
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.,13
Throw this report on their incensed rage,13
Forgive the comment that my passion made,13
And foul imaginary eyes of blood,13
O answer not but to my closet bring,13
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.,13
SCENE III. Before the castle.,13
The wall is high and yet will I leap down:,13
There's few or none do know me: if they did,13
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.,13
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:,13
Leaps down,13
Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones!,13
Enter PEMBROKE SALISBURY and BIGOT,13
It is our safety and we must embrace,13
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?,13
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love,13
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.,13
Two long days' journey lords or ere we meet.,13
Once more to-day well met distemper'd lords!,13
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:,13
With our pure honours nor attend the foot,13
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.,13
Our griefs and not our manners reason now.,13
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.,13
Tis true to hurt his master no man else.,13
Seeing ARTHUR,13
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.,13
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.,13
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.,13
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?,13
That you do see? could thought without this object,13
The height the crest or crest unto the crest,13
The wildest savagery the vilest stroke,13
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.,13
And this so sole and so unmatchable,13
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;,13
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.,13
The graceless action of a heavy hand,13
If that it be the work of any hand!,13
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;,13
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,13
And breathing to his breathless excellence,13
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,13
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,13
By giving it the worship of revenge.,13
Enter HUBERT,13
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.,13
Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone!,13
Must I rob the law?,13
Your sword is bright sir; put it up again.,13
Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say;,13
I would not have you lord forget yourself,13
Lest I by marking of your rage forget,13
Out dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?,13
My innocent life against an emperor.,13
Do not prove me so;,13
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly lies.,13
Keep the peace I say.,13
Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury:,13
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,13
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,13
What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge?,13
Lord Bigot I am none.,13
Tis not an hour since I left him well:,13
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.,13
For villany is not without such rheum;,13
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.,13
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;,13
Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there!,13
Exeunt Lords,13
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach,13
Art thou damn'd Hubert.,13
Ha! I'll tell thee what;,13
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:,13
As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child.,13
If thou didst but consent,13
And if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread,13
Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam,13
Put but a little water in a spoon,13
Enough to stifle such a villain up.,13
If I in act consent or sin of thought,13
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,13
I left him well.,13
I am amazed methinks and lose my way,13
How easy dost thou take all England up!,13
The life the right and truth of all this realm,13
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth,13
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty,13
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:,13
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,13
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.,13
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,13
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,13
Exeunt,13
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.,13
Thus have I yielded up into your hand,13
Giving the crown,13
From this my hand as holding of the pope,13
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,13
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.,13
Our people quarrel with obedience,13
To stranger blood to foreign royalty.,13
Rests by you only to be qualified:,13
That present medicine must be minister'd,13
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,13
But since you are a gentle convertite,13
And make fair weather in your blustering land.,13
Upon your oath of service to the pope,13
Exit,13
Say that before Ascension-day at noon,13
I did suppose it should be on constraint:,13
Enter the BASTARD,13
But Dover castle: London hath received,13
Your nobles will not hear you but are gone,13
And wild amazement hurries up and down,13
Would not my lords return to me again,13
They found him dead and cast into the streets,13
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.,13
So on my soul he did for aught he knew.,13
Be great in act as you have been in thought;,13
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:,13
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow,13
That borrow their behaviors from the great,13
The dauntless spirit of resolution.,13
When he intendeth to become the field:,13
What shall they seek the lion in his den,13
O let it not be said: forage and run,13
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.,13
And I have made a happy peace with him;,13
Led by the Dauphin.,13
Shall we upon the footing of our land,13
Insinuation parley and base truce,13
A cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields,13
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,13
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;,13
They saw we had a purpose of defence.,13
Away then with good courage! yet I know,13
Exeunt,13
Enter in arms LEWIS SALISBURY MELUN PEMBROKE BIGOT and Soldiers,13
And keep it safe for our remembrance:,13
That having our fair order written down,13
May know wherefore we took the sacrament,13
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.,13
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith,13
I am not glad that such a sore of time,13
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound,13
That I must draw this metal from my side,13
Where honourable rescue and defence,13
But such is the infection of the time,13
We cannot deal but with the very hand,13
And is't not pity O my grieved friends,13
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;,13
Upon her gentle bosom and fill up,13
Upon the spot of this enforced cause--,13
And follow unacquainted colours here?,13
That Neptune's arms who clippeth thee about,13
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;,13
The blood of malice in a vein of league,13
A noble temper dost thou show in this;,13
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.,13
Between compulsion and a brave respect!,13
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:,13
Being an ordinary inundation;,13
This shower blown up by tempest of the soul,13
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven,13
Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury,13
Commend these waters to those baby eyes,13
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,13
Come come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep,13
As Lewis himself: so nobles shall you all,13
And even there methinks an angel spake:,13
Look where the holy legate comes apace,13
And on our actions set the name of right,13
Hail noble prince of France!,13
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,13
The great metropolis and see of Rome:,13
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,13
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,13
Your grace shall pardon me I will not back:,13
To be a secondary at control,13
To any sovereign state throughout the world.,13
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,13
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out,13
You taught me how to know the face of right,13
Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart;,13
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?,13
After young Arthur claim this land for mine;,13
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?,13
What men provided what munition sent,13
That undergo this charge? who else but I,13
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?,13
Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?,13
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?,13
No no on my soul it never shall be said.,13
Outside or inside I will not return,13
As to my ample hope was promised,13
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,13
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.,13
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?,13
According to the fair play of the world,13
My holy lord of Milan from the king,13
And as you answer I do know the scope,13
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,13
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.,13
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;,13
He is prepared and reason too he should:,13
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,13
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared,13
From out the circle of his territories.,13
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,13
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,13
To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out,13
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,13
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,13
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms,13
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.,13
You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb,13
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids,13
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,13
To fierce and bloody inclination.,13
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;,13
With such a brabbler.,13
No I will speak.,13
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,13
Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out;,13
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,13
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;,13
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear,13
Not trusting to this halting legate here,13
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits,13
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.,13
And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt.,13
SCENE III. The field of battle.,13
How goes the day with us? O tell me Hubert.,13
This fever that hath troubled me so long,13
Enter a Messenger,13
Desires your majesty to leave the field,13
Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there.,13
That was expected by the Dauphin here,13
This news was brought to Richard but even now:,13
Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,13
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;,13
Exeunt,13
Enter SALISBURY PEMBROKE and BIGOT,13
Up once again; put spirit in the French:,13
That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge,13
They say King John sore sick hath left the field.,13
Lead me to the revolts of England here.,13
It is the Count Melun.,13
Fly noble English you are bought and sold;,13
And welcome home again discarded faith.,13
For if the French be lords of this loud day,13
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn,13
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;,13
Dear amity and everlasting love.,13
Have I not hideous death within my view,13
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax,13
What in the world should make me now deceive,13
Why should I then be false since it is true,13
I say again if Lewis do win the day,13
Behold another day break in the east:,13
Already smokes about the burning crest,13
Even this ill night your breathing shall expire,13
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,13
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:,13
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,13
In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence,13
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts,13
With contemplation and devout desires.,13
But I do love the favour and the form,13
We will untread the steps of damned flight,13
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,13
And cabby run on in obedience,13
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;,13
Right in thine eye. Away my friends! New flight;,13
Exeunt leading off MELUN,13
Enter LEWIS and his train,13
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,13
In faint retire. O bravely came we off,13
After such bloody toil we bid good night;,13
Last in the field and almost lords of it!,13
Where is my prince the Dauphin?,13
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords,13
And your supply which you have wish'd so long,13
Ah foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!,13
As this hath made me. Who was he that said,13
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?,13
Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:,13
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.,13
SCENE VI. An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.,13
Who's there? speak ho! speak quickly or I shoot.,13
Of the part of England.,13
What's that to thee? why may not I demand,13
Hubert I think?,13
I will upon all hazards well believe,13
Who art thou?,13
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think,13
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night,13
That any accent breaking from thy tongue,13
Come come; sans compliment what news abroad?,13
To find you out.,13
O my sweet sir news fitting to the night,13
Show me the very wound of this ill news:,13
The king I fear is poison'd by a monk:,13
To acquaint you with this evil that you might,13
Than if you had at leisure known of this.,13
A monk I tell you; a resolved villain,13
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.,13
Why know you not? the lords are all come back,13
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,13
Withhold thine indignation mighty heaven,13
I'll tell tree Hubert half my power this night,13
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;,13
Away before: conduct me to the king;,13
Exeunt,13
Enter PRINCE HENRY SALISBURY and BIGOT,13
Is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain,13
Doth by the idle comments that it makes,13
Enter PEMBROKE,13
That being brought into the open air,13
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.,13
Doth he still rage?,13
He is more patient,13
O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes,13
Death having prey'd upon the outward parts,13
Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds,13
Whi ch in their throng and press to that last hold,13
should sing.,13
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,13
His soul and body to their lasting rest.,13
To set a form upon that indigest,13
Enter Attendants and BIGOT carrying KING JOHN in a chair,13
It would not out at windows nor at doors.,13
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:,13
Upon a parchment and against this fire,13
How fares your majesty?,13
And none of you will bid the winter come,13
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course,13
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips,13
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait,13
O that there were some virtue in my tears,13
The salt in them is hot.,13
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize,13
Enter the BASTARD,13
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!,13
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,13
Are turned to one thread one little hair:,13
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;,13
And module of confounded royalty.,13
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;,13
As I upon advantage did remove,13
Devoured by the unexpected flood.,13
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.,13
Even so must I run on and even so stop.,13
When this was now a king and now is clay?,13
To do the office for thee of revenge,13
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.,13
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,13
To push destruction and perpetual shame,13
Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought;,13
It seems you know not then so much as we:,13
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,13
As we with honour and respect may take,13
He will the rather do it when he sees,13
Nay it is in a manner done already;,13
To the sea-side and put his cause and quarrel,13
With whom yourself myself and other lords,13
To consummate this business happily.,13
With other princes that may best be spared,13
At Worcester must his body be interr'd;,13
Thither shall it then:,13
The lineal state and glory of the land!,13
I do bequeath my faithful services,13
And the like tender of our love we make,13
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,13
O let us pay the time but needful woe,13
This England never did nor never shall,13
But when it first did help to wound itself.,13
Come the three corners of the world in arms,13
If England to itself do rest but true.,13
ACT I,14
Enter FLAVIUS MARULLUS and certain Commoners,14
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,14
Upon a labouring day without the sign,14
Why sir a carpenter.,14
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?,14
Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but,14
But what trade art thou? answer me directly.,14
conscience; which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles.,14
Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me: yet,14
What meanest thou by that? mend me thou saucy fellow!,14
Thou art a cobbler art thou?,14
meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's,14
to old shoes; when they are in great danger I,14
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.,14
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?,14
into more work. But indeed sir we make holiday,14
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?,14
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?,14
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome,14
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,14
Your infants in your arms and there have sat,14
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:,14
Have you not made an universal shout,14
To hear the replication of your sounds,14
And do you now put on your best attire?,14
And do you now strew flowers in his way,14
Run to your houses fall upon your knees,14
That needs must light on this ingratitude.,14
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;,14
Into the channel till the lowest stream,14
Exeunt all the Commoners,14
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.,14
This way will I disrobe the images,14
May we do so?,14
It is no matter; let no images,14
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:,14
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing,14
Who else would soar above the view of men,14
Exeunt,14
Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY for the course;  CALPURNIA PORTIA DECIUS BRUTUS CICERO BRUTUS  CASSIUS and CASCA; a great crowd following among them a Soothsayer,14
Peace ho! Caesar speaks.,14
Here my lord.,14
When he doth run his course. Antonius!,14
Forget not in your speed Antonius,14
The barren touched in this holy chase,14
I shall remember:,14
Set on; and leave no ceremony out.,14
Caesar!,14
Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!,14
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music,14
Beware the ides of March.,14
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.,14
Fellow come from the throng; look upon Caesar.,14
Beware the ides of March.,14
Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS,14
Not I.,14
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part,14
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires;,14
Brutus I do observe you now of late:,14
And show of love as I was wont to have:,14
Over your friend that loves you.,14
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,14
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am,14
Conceptions only proper to myself,14
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--,14
Nor construe any further my neglect,14
Forgets the shows of love to other men.,14
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried,14
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face?,14
But by reflection by some other things.,14
And it is very much lamented Brutus,14
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,14
Where many of the best respect in Rome,14
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,14
Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius,14
For that which is not in me?,14
And since you know you cannot see yourself,14
Will modestly discover to yourself,14
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus:,14
To stale with ordinary oaths my love,14
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard,14
That I profess myself in banqueting,14
Flourish and shout,14
Choose Caesar for their king.,14
Then must I think you would not have it so.,14
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?,14
If it be aught toward the general good,14
And I will look on both indifferently,14
The name of honour more than I fear death.,14
As well as I do know your outward favour.,14
I cannot tell what you and other men,14
I had as lief not be as live to be,14
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:,14
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:,14
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,14
Leap in with me into this angry flood,14
Accoutred as I was I plunged in,14
The torrent roar'd and we did buffet it,14
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;,14
Caesar cried 'Help me Cassius or I sink!',14
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder,14
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man,14
A wretched creature and must bend his body,14
He had a fever when he was in Spain,14
How he did shake: 'tis true this god did shake;,14
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world,14
Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans,14
Alas it cried 'Give me some drink Titinius',14
A man of such a feeble temper should,14
And bear the palm alone.,14
Another general shout!,14
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.,14
Like a Colossus and we petty men,14
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.,14
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars,14
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?,14
Write them together yours is as fair a name;,14
Weigh them it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,14
Now in the names of all the gods at once,14
That he is grown so great? Age thou art shamed!,14
When went there by an age since the great flood,14
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome,14
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,14
O you and I have heard our fathers say,14
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,14
That you do love me I am nothing jealous;,14
How I have thought of this and of these times,14
I would not so with love I might entreat you,14
I will consider; what you have to say,14
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.,14
Brutus had rather be a villager,14
Under these hard conditions as this time,14
I am glad that my weak words,14
The games are done and Caesar is returning.,14
And he will after his sour fashion tell you,14
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train,14
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,14
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero,14
As we have seen him in the Capitol,14
Casca will tell us what the matter is.,14
Caesar?,14
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:,14
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.,14
He is a noble Roman and well given.,14
Yet if my name were liable to fear,14
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;,14
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,14
Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort,14
That could be moved to smile at any thing.,14
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,14
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd,14
Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf,14
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train but CASCA,14
Ay Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,14
Why you were with him were you not?,14
Why there was a crown offered him: and being,14
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.,14
Why for that too.,14
Why for that too.,14
Ay marry was't and he put it by thrice every,14
mine honest neighbours shouted.,14
Why Antony.,14
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:,14
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown,14
you he put it by once: but for all that to my,14
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:,14
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third,14
refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their,14
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because,14
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and,14
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.,14
He fell down in the market-place and foamed at,14
Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.,14
And honest Casca we have the falling sickness.,14
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not,14
displeased them as they use to do the players in,14
What said he when he came unto himself?,14
common herd was glad he refused the crown he,14
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any,14
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so,14
If he had done or said any thing amiss he desired,14
or four wenches where I stood cried 'Alas good,14
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had,14
And after that he came thus sad away?,14
Did Cicero say any thing?,14
To what effect?,14
face again: but those that understood him smiled at,14
part it was Greek to me. I could tell you more,14
off Caesar's images are put to silence. Fare you,14
remember it.,14
No I am promised forth.,14
Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner,14
Good: I will expect you.,14
Exit,14
He was quick mettle when he went to school.,14
Of any bold or noble enterprise,14
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,14
With better appetite.,14
To-morrow if you please to speak with me,14
Come home to me and I will wait for you.,14
Exit BRUTUS,14
Thy honourable metal may be wrought,14
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;,14
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:,14
He should not humour me. I will this night,14
As if they came from several citizens,14
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely,14
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;,14
Exit,14
Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides CASCA with his sword drawn and CICERO,14
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?,14
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,14
Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen,14
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:,14
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.,14
Or else the world too saucy with the gods,14
Why saw you any thing more wonderful?,14
Held up his left hand which did flame and burn,14
Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.,14
Against the Capitol I met a lion,14
Without annoying me: and there were drawn,14
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw,14
And yesterday the bird of night did sit,14
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies,14
These are their reasons; they are natural;',14
Unto the climate that they point upon.,14
But men may construe things after their fashion,14
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?,14
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.,14
Is not to walk in.,14
Exit CICERO,14
Who's there?,14
Casca by your voice.,14
A very pleasing night to honest men.,14
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.,14
Submitting me unto the perilous night,14
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;,14
The breast of heaven I did present myself,14
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?,14
When the most mighty gods by tokens send,14
You are dull Casca and those sparks of life,14
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,14
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:,14
Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts,14
Why old men fool and children calculate,14
Their natures and preformed faculties,14
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,14
Unto some monstrous state.,14
Most like this dreadful night,14
As doth the lion in the Capitol,14
In personal action yet prodigious grown,14
Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not Cassius?,14
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;,14
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;,14
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow,14
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,14
I know where I will wear this dagger then;,14
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong;,14
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass,14
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;,14
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.,14
That part of tyranny that I do bear,14
Thunder still,14
So every bondman in his own hand bears,14
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?,14
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:,14
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire,14
What rubbish and what offal when it serves,14
So vile a thing as Caesar! But O grief,14
Before a willing bondman; then I know,14
And dangers are to me indifferent.,14
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold my hand:,14
And I will set this foot of mine as far,14
There's a bargain made.,14
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans,14
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;,14
In Pompey's porch: for now this fearful night,14
And the complexion of the element,14
Most bloody fiery and most terrible.,14
Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;,14
Enter CINNA,14
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?,14
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for Cinna?,14
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.,14
Yes you are.,14
But win the noble Brutus to our party--,14
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,14
In at his window; set this up with wax,14
Repair to Pompey's porch where you shall find us.,14
All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone,14
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.,14
Exit CINNA,14
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him,14
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.,14
And that which would appear offence in us,14
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.,14
You have right well conceited. Let us go,14
We will awake him and be sure of him.,14
ACT II,14
Enter BRUTUS,14
I cannot by the progress of the stars,14
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.,14
Enter LUCIUS,14
Get me a taper in my study Lucius:,14
I will my lord.,14
It must be by his death: and for my part,14
But for the general. He would be crown'd:,14
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;,14
And then I grant we put a sting in him,14
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins,14
I have not known when his affections sway'd,14
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,14
But when he once attains the upmost round.,14
Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees,14
Then lest he may prevent. And since the quarrel,14
Fashion it thus; that what he is augmented,14
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg,14
And kill him in the shell.,14
The taper burneth in your closet sir.,14
This paper thus seal'd up; and I am sure,14
Gives him the letter,14
Is not to-morrow boy the ides of March?,14
Look in the calendar and bring me word.,14
Exit,14
Give so much light that I may read by them.,14
Brutus thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself.,14
Brutus thou sleep'st: awake!',14
Where I have took them up.,14
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What Rome?,14
The Tarquin drive when he was call'd a king.,14
To speak and strike? O Rome I make thee promise:,14
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!,14
Sir March is wasted fourteen days.,14
Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.,14
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,14
Between the acting of a dreadful thing,14
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream:,14
Are then in council; and the state of man,14
The nature of an insurrection.,14
Sir 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,14
Is he alone?,14
Do you know them?,14
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,14
By any mark of favour.,14
Exit LUCIUS,14
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,14
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough,14
Hide it in smiles and affability:,14
Not Erebus itself were dim enough,14
Enter the conspirators CASSIUS CASCA DECIUS BRUTUS CINNA METELLUS CIMBER and TREBONIUS,14
Good morrow Brutus; do we trouble you?,14
Know I these men that come along with you?,14
But honours you; and every one doth wish,14
Which every noble Roman bears of you.,14
He is welcome hither.,14
He is welcome too.,14
They are all welcome.,14
Betwixt your eyes and night?,14
BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper,14
No.,14
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.,14
Here as I point my sword the sun arises,14
Weighing the youthful season of the year.,14
He first presents his fire; and the high east,14
Give me your hands all over one by one.,14
No not an oath: if not the face of men,14
If these be motives weak break off betimes,14
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,14
As I am sure they do bear fire enough,14
The melting spirits of women then countrymen,14
To prick us to redress? what other bond,14
And will not palter? and what other oath,14
That this shall be or we will fall for it?,14
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls,14
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain,14
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,14
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood,14
Is guilty of a several bastardy,14
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.,14
I think he will stand very strong with us.,14
No by no means.,14
Will purchase us a good opinion,14
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands;,14
But all be buried in his gravity.,14
For he will never follow any thing,14
Then leave him out.,14
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?,14
Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar,14
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,14
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,14
Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius,14
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;,14
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius.,14
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:,14
And not dismember Caesar! But alas,14
Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully;,14
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:,14
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,14
Our purpose necessary and not envious:,14
We shall be call'd purgers not murderers.,14
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm,14
Yet I fear him;,14
Alas good Cassius do not think of him:,14
Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar:,14
To sports to wildness and much company.,14
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.,14
Peace! count the clock.,14
Tis time to part.,14
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day or no;,14
Quite from the main opinion he held once,14
It may be these apparent prodigies,14
And the persuasion of his augurers,14
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,14
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,14
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;,14
He says he does being then most flattered.,14
For I can give his humour the true bent,14
Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him.,14
Be that the uttermost and fail not then.,14
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:,14
Now good Metellus go along by him:,14
Send him but hither and I'll fashion him.,14
And friends disperse yourselves; but all remember,14
Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily;,14
But bear it as our Roman actors do,14
And so good morrow to you every one.,14
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;,14
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,14
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.,14
Brutus my lord!,14
It is not for your health thus to commit,14
Nor for yours neither. You've ungently Brutus,14
You suddenly arose and walk'd about,14
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,14
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,14
Yet I insisted yet you answer'd not,14
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;,14
Which seem'd too much enkindled and withal,14
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.,14
And could it work so much upon your shape,14
I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,14
I am not well in health and that is all.,14
He would embrace the means to come by it.,14
Is Brutus sick? and is it physical,14
Of the dank morning? What is Brutus sick,14
To dare the vile contagion of the night,14
To add unto his sickness? No my Brutus;,14
Which by the right and virtue of my place,14
I charm you by my once-commended beauty,14
Which did incorporate and make us one,14
Why you are heavy and what men to-night,14
Some six or seven who did hide their faces,14
Kneel not gentle Portia.,14
Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus,14
That appertain to you? Am I yourself,14
To keep with you at meals comfort your bed,14
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,14
You are my true and honourable wife,14
That visit my sad heart,14
I grant I am a woman; but withal,14
I grant I am a woman; but withal,14
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,14
Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em:,14
Giving myself a voluntary wound,14
And not my husband's secrets?,14
Render me worthy of this noble wife!,14
Hark hark! one knocks: Portia go in awhile;,14
The secrets of my heart.,14
All the charactery of my sad brows:,14
Exit PORTIA,14
Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS,14
Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of.,14
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.,14
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!,14
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.,14
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.,14
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!,14
Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up,14
And I will strive with things impossible;,14
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.,14
That must we also. What it is my Caius,14
To whom it must be done.,14
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,14
That Brutus leads me on.,14
Exeunt,14
Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR in his night-gown,14
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,14
Enter a Servant,14
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,14
I will my lord.,14
Enter CALPURNIA,14
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.,14
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see,14
Caesar I never stood on ceremonies,14
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,14
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;,14
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,14
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;,14
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,14
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,14
What can be avoided,14
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions,14
When beggars die there are no comets seen;,14
Cowards die many times before their deaths;,14
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.,14
Seeing that death a necessary end,14
Re-enter Servant,14
They would not have you to stir forth to-day.,14
They could not find a heart within the beast.,14
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,14
No Caesar shall not: danger knows full well,14
We are two lions litter'd in one day,14
And Caesar shall go forth.,14
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.,14
That keeps you in the house and not your own.,14
And he shall say you are not well to-day:,14
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,14
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS,14
Caesar all hail! good morrow worthy Caesar:,14
And you are come in very happy time,14
And tell them that I will not come to-day:,14
I will not come to-day: tell them so Decius.,14
Shall Caesar send a lie?,14
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?,14
Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause,14
The cause is in my will: I will not come;,14
But for your private satisfaction,14
Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home:,14
Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts,14
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it:,14
And evils imminent; and on her knee,14
This dream is all amiss interpreted;,14
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,14
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck,14
For tinctures stains relics and cognizance.,14
And this way have you well expounded it.,14
And know it now: the senate have concluded,14
If you shall send them word you will not come,14
Apt to be render'd for some one to say,14
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.',14
Lo Caesar is afraid'?,14
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;,14
How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia!,14
Give me my robe for I will go.,14
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.,14
Welcome Publius.,14
Good morrow Casca. Caius Ligarius,14
As that same ague which hath made you lean.,14
Caesar 'tis strucken eight.,14
Enter ANTONY,14
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow Antony.,14
Bid them prepare within:,14
Now Cinna: now Metellus: what Trebonius!,14
Remember that you call on me to-day:,14
Caesar I will:,14
and so near will I be,14
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me;,14
[Aside]  That every like is not the same O Caesar,14
Exeunt,14
Enter ARTEMIDORUS reading a paper,14
come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna trust not,14
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.,14
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,14
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,14
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,14
My heart laments that virtue cannot live,14
If thou read this O Caesar thou mayst live;,14
Exit,14
Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS,14
Stay not to answer me but get thee gone:,14
To know my errand madam.,14
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.,14
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!,14
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!,14
Madam what should I do?,14
And so return to you and nothing else?,14
For he went sickly forth: and take good note,14
Hark boy! what noise is that?,14
Prithee listen well;,14
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.,14
Enter the Soothsayer,14
At mine own house good lady.,14
About the ninth hour lady.,14
Madam not yet: I go to take my stand,14
Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not?,14
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,14
Why know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?,14
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:,14
Of senators of praetors common suitors,14
I'll get me to a place more void and there,14
Exit,14
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,14
Sure the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit,14
Run Lucius and commend me to my lord;,14
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.,14
ACT III,14
A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR BRUTUS  CASSIUS CASCA DECIUS BRUTUS METELLUS CIMBER  TREBONIUS CINNA ANTONY LEPIDUS POPILIUS PUBLIUS and others,14
Ay Caesar; but not gone.,14
Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,14
O Caesar read mine first; for mine's a suit,14
What touches us ourself shall be last served.,14
What is the fellow mad?,14
What urge you your petitions in the street?,14
CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House the rest following,14
What enterprise Popilius?,14
Advances to CAESAR,14
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.,14
Look how he makes to Caesar; mark him.,14
Brutus what shall be done? If this be known,14
For I will slay myself.,14
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;,14
Trebonius knows his time; for look you Brutus.,14
Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS,14
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.,14
Casca you are the first that rears your hand.,14
That Caesar and his senate must redress?,14
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat,14
Kneeling,14
These couchings and these lowly courtesies,14
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree,14
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood,14
With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,14
Thy brother by decree is banished:,14
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.,14
Will he be satisfied.,14
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear,14
I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar;,14
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.,14
Pardon Caesar; Caesar pardon:,14
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.,14
If I could pray to move prayers would move me:,14
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality,14
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,14
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:,14
And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive;,14
That unassailable holds on his rank,14
Let me a little show it even in this;,14
And constant do remain to keep him so.,14
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?,14
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?,14
CASCA first then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR,14
Dies,14
Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets.,14
Liberty freedom and enfranchisement!',14
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.,14
And Cassius too.,14
Here quite confounded with this mutiny.,14
Should chance--,14
There is no harm intended to your person,14
And leave us Publius; lest that the people,14
Do so: and let no man abide this deed,14
Re-enter TREBONIUS,14
Fled to his house amazed:,14
As it were doomsday.,14
That we shall die we know; 'tis but the time,14
Why he that cuts off twenty years of life,14
Grant that and then is death a benefit:,14
His time of fearing death. Stoop Romans stoop,14
Up to the elbows and besmear our swords:,14
And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,14
Stoop then and wash. How many ages hence,14
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!,14
That now on Pompey's basis lies along,14
So oft as that shall be,14
The men that gave their country liberty.,14
Ay every man away:,14
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.,14
Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.,14
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;,14
Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest;,14
Say I love Brutus and I honour him;,14
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony,14
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,14
So well as Brutus living; but will follow,14
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state,14
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;,14
Tell him so please him come unto this place,14
Depart untouch'd.,14
Exit,14
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind,14
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.,14
Re-enter ANTONY,14
O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?,14
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.,14
Who else must be let blood who else is rank:,14
As Caesar's death hour nor no instrument,14
With the most noble blood of all this world.,14
Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,14
I shall not find myself so apt to die:,14
As here by Caesar and by you cut off,14
O Antony beg not your death of us.,14
As by our hands and this our present act,14
And this the bleeding business they have done:,14
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--,14
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,14
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts,14
With all kind love good thoughts and reverence.,14
In the disposing of new dignities.,14
The multitude beside themselves with fear,14
Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him,14
I doubt not of your wisdom.,14
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you;,14
Now Decius Brutus yours: now yours Metellus;,14
Though last not last in love yours good Trebonius.,14
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,14
Either a coward or a flatterer.,14
If then thy spirit look upon us now,14
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,14
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?,14
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,14
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.,14
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,14
O world thou wast the forest to this hart;,14
How like a deer strucken by many princes,14
Mark Antony--,14
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;,14
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;,14
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;,14
Therefore I took your hands but was indeed,14
Friends am I with you all and love you all,14
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.,14
Our reasons are so full of good regard,14
You should be satisfied.,14
And am moreover suitor that I may,14
And in the pulpit as becomes a friend,14
You shall Mark Antony.,14
Aside to BRUTUS,14
That Antony speak in his funeral:,14
By that which he will utter?,14
I will myself into the pulpit first,14
What Antony shall speak I will protest,14
And that we are contented Caesar shall,14
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.,14
Mark Antony here take you Caesar's body.,14
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,14
Else shall you not have any hand at all,14
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,14
Be it so.,14
Prepare the body then and follow us.,14
O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth,14
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man,14
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!,14
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips,14
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;,14
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;,14
And dreadful objects so familiar,14
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;,14
And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,14
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice,14
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth,14
Enter a Servant,14
I do Mark Antony.,14
He did receive his letters and is coming;,14
O Caesar!--,14
Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep.,14
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,14
He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.,14
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome,14
Hie hence and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;,14
Into the market-place: there shall I try,14
The cruel issue of these bloody men;,14
To young Octavius of the state of things.,14
Exeunt with CAESAR's body,14
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS and a throng of Citizens,14
Then follow me and give me audience friends.,14
And part the numbers.,14
Those that will follow Cassius go with him;,14
Of Caesar's death.,14
I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,14
Exit CASSIUS with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit,14
Be patient till the last.,14
cause and be silent that you may hear: believe me,14
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom and,14
If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of,14
was no less than his. If then that friend demand,14
--Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved,14
die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live,14
as he was fortunate I rejoice at it; as he was,14
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his,14
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a,14
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If,14
vile that will not love his country? If any speak;,14
None Brutus none.,14
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of,14
extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences,14
Enter ANTONY and others with CAESAR's body,14
though he had no hand in his death shall receive,14
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this,14
good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself,14
Live Brutus! live live!,14
Give him a statue with his ancestors.,14
Caesar's better parts,14
We'll bring him to his house,14
My countrymen--,14
Peace ho!,14
And for my sake stay here with Antony:,14
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,14
I do entreat you not a man depart,14
Exit,14
Let him go up into the public chair;,14
For Brutus' sake I am beholding to you.,14
What does he say of Brutus?,14
He finds himself beholding to us all.,14
This Caesar was a tyrant.,14
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.,14
You gentle Romans--,14
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears;,14
The evil that men do lives after them;,14
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus,14
If it were so it was a grievous fault,14
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest--,14
So are they all all honourable men--,14
He was my friend faithful and just to me:,14
And Brutus is an honourable man.,14
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:,14
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept:,14
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;,14
You all did see that on the Lupercal,14
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?,14
And sure he is an honourable man.,14
But here I am to speak what I do know.,14
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?,14
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;,14
And I must pause till it come back to me.,14
If thou consider rightly of the matter,14
Has he masters?,14
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;,14
If it be found so some will dear abide it.,14
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.,14
But yesterday the word of Caesar might,14
And none so poor to do him reverence.,14
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,14
Who you all know are honourable men:,14
To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you,14
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;,14
Let but the commons hear this testament--,14
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,14
Yea beg a hair of him for memory,14
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy,14
We'll hear the will: read it Mark Antony.,14
Have patience gentle friends I must not read it;,14
You are not wood you are not stones but men;,14
It will inflame you it will make you mad:,14
For if you should O what would come of it!,14
You shall read us the will Caesar's will.,14
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:,14
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.,14
The will! the testament!,14
You will compel me then to read the will?,14
And let me show you him that made the will.,14
Come down.,14
You shall have leave.,14
A ring; stand round.,14
Room for Antony most noble Antony.,14
Stand back; room; bear back.,14
You all do know this mantle: I remember,14
Twas on a summer's evening in his tent,14
Look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:,14
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;,14
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,14
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no;,14
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him!,14
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,14
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;,14
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,14
O what a fall was there my countrymen!,14
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.,14
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.,14
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,14
O piteous spectacle!,14
O woful day!,14
O most bloody sight!,14
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!,14
Stay countrymen.,14
We'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him.,14
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.,14
What private griefs they have alas I know not,14
And will no doubt with reasons answer you.,14
I am no orator as Brutus is;,14
That love my friend; and that they know full well,14
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth,14
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;,14
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths,14
And Brutus Antony there were an Antony,14
In every wound of Caesar that should move,14
We'll mutiny.,14
Away then! come seek the conspirators.,14
Peace ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!,14
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?,14
You have forgot the will I told you of.,14
Here is the will and under Caesar's seal.,14
To every several man seventy-five drachmas.,14
O royal Caesar!,14
Peace ho!,14
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,14
And to your heirs for ever common pleasures,14
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?,14
We'll burn his body in the holy place,14
Take up the body.,14
Pluck down benches.,14
Exeunt Citizens with the body,14
Take thou what course thou wilt!,14
How now fellow!,14
Where is he?,14
And thither will I straight to visit him:,14
And in this mood will give us any thing.,14
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.,14
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.,14
SCENE III. A street.,14
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,14
I have no will to wander forth of doors,14
Enter Citizens,14
Whither are you going?,14
Are you a married man or a bachelor?,14
Ay and briefly.,14
Ay and truly you were best.,14
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then to,14
truly: wisely I say I am a bachelor.,14
you'll bear me a bang for that I fear. Proceed; directly.,14
As a friend or an enemy?,14
That matter is answered directly.,14
Briefly I dwell by the Capitol.,14
Truly my name is Cinna.,14
I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet.,14
I am not Cinna the conspirator.,14
name out of his heart and turn him going.,14
to Brutus' to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius',14
Exeunt,14
SCENE I. A house in Rome.,14
These many then shall die; their names are prick'd.,14
I do consent--,14
Upon condition Publius shall not live,14
He shall not live; look with a spot I damn him.,14
Fetch the will hither and we shall determine,14
What shall I find you here?,14
Exit LEPIDUS,14
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,14
One of the three to share it?,14
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,14
Octavius I have seen more days than you:,14
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,14
To groan and sweat under the business,14
And having brought our treasure where we will,14
Like to the empty ass to shake his ears,14
You may do your will;,14
So is my horse Octavius; and for that,14
It is a creature that I teach to fight,14
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.,14
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;,14
On abjects orts and imitations,14
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,14
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius,14
Therefore let our alliance be combined,14
And let us presently go sit in council,14
And open perils surest answered.,14
And bay'd about with many enemies;,14
Millions of mischiefs.,14
SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.,14
Stand ho!,14
What now Lucilius! is Cassius near?,14
To do you salutation from his master.,14
In his own change or by ill officers,14
Things done undone: but if he be at hand,14
I do not doubt,14
Such as he is full of regard and honour.,14
How he received you let me be resolved.,14
But not with such familiar instances,14
As he hath used of old.,14
A hot friend cooling: ever note Lucilius,14
It useth an enforced ceremony.,14
But hollow men like horses hot at hand,14
But when they should endure the bloody spur,14
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?,14
The greater part the horse in general,14
Hark! he is arrived.,14
March gently on to meet him.,14
Stand ho!,14
Stand!,14
Stand!,14
Judge me you gods! wrong I mine enemies?,14
Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs;,14
Cassius be content.,14
Before the eyes of both our armies here,14
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;,14
And I will give you audience.,14
Bid our commanders lead their charges off,14
Lucilius do you the like; and let no man,14
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.,14
SCENE III. Brutus's tent.,14
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:,14
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;,14
Because I knew the man were slighted off.,14
In such a time as this it is not meet,14
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself,14
To sell and mart your offices for gold,14
I an itching palm!,14
Or by the gods this speech were else your last.,14
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.,14
Remember March the ides of March remember:,14
What villain touch'd his body that did stab,14
That struck the foremost man of all this world,14
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,14
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?,14
Than such a Roman.,14
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,14
Older in practise abler than yourself,14
Go to; you are not Cassius.,14
I say you are not.,14
Have mind upon your health tempt me no further.,14
Is't possible?,14
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?,14
O ye gods ye gods! must I endure all this?,14
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,14
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch,14
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,14
I'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter,14
Is it come to this?,14
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,14
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.,14
I said an elder soldier not a better:,14
If you did I care not.,14
Peace peace! you durst not so have tempted him.,14
No.,14
For your life you durst not!,14
I may do that I shall be sorry for.,14
There is no terror Cassius in your threats,14
That they pass by me as the idle wind,14
For certain sums of gold which you denied me:,14
By heaven I had rather coin my heart,14
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash,14
To you for gold to pay my legions,14
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?,14
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,14
Dash him to pieces!,14
You did.,14
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:,14
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.,14
You love me not.,14
A friendly eye could never see such faults.,14
As huge as high Olympus.,14
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,14
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;,14
Set in a note-book learn'd and conn'd by rote,14
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,14
Dearer than Plutus' mine richer than gold:,14
I that denied thee gold will give my heart:,14
When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better,14
Sheathe your dagger:,14
Do what you will dishonour shall be humour.,14
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;,14
And straight is cold again.,14
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,14
When I spoke that I was ill-temper'd too.,14
And my heart too.,14
What's the matter?,14
When that rash humour which my mother gave me,14
Yes Cassius; and from henceforth,14
He'll think your mother chides and leave you so.,14
There is some grudge between 'em 'tis not meet,14
[Within]  You shall not come to them.,14
Enter Poet followed by LUCILIUS TITINIUS and LUCIUS,14
For shame you generals! what do you mean?,14
For I have seen more years I'm sure than ye.,14
Get you hence sirrah; saucy fellow hence!,14
I'll know his humour when he knows his time:,14
Companion hence!,14
Exit Poet,14
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.,14
Immediately to us.,14
Lucius a bowl of wine!,14
I did not think you could have been so angry.,14
Of your philosophy you make no use,14
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.,14
She is dead.,14
O insupportable and touching loss!,14
Impatient of my absence,14
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death,14
And her attendants absent swallow'd fire.,14
Even so.,14
Re-enter LUCIUS with wine and taper,14
In this I bury all unkindness Cassius.,14
Fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup;,14
Come in Titinius!,14
Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA,14
Now sit we close about this taper here,14
Portia art thou gone?,14
Messala I have here received letters,14
Come down upon us with a mighty power,14
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.,14
That by proscription and bills of outlawry,14
Have put to death an hundred senators.,14
Mine speak of seventy senators that died,14
Cicero one!,14
And by that order of proscription.,14
No Messala.,14
Nothing Messala.,14
Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?,14
Now as you are a Roman tell me true.,14
For certain she is dead and by strange manner.,14
With meditating that she must die once,14
Even so great men great losses should endure.,14
But yet my nature could not bear it so.,14
Of marching to Philippi presently?,14
Your reason?,14
Tis better that the enemy seek us:,14
Doing himself offence; whilst we lying still,14
Good reasons must of force give place to better.,14
Do stand but in a forced affection;,14
The enemy marching along by them,14
Come on refresh'd new-added and encouraged;,14
If at Philippi we do face him there,14
Hear me good brother.,14
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,14
The enemy increaseth every day;,14
There is a tide in the affairs of men,14
Omitted all the voyage of their life,14
On such a full sea are we now afloat;,14
Or lose our ventures.,14
We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.,14
And nature must obey necessity;,14
There is no more to say?,14
Early to-morrow will we rise and hence.,14
Enter LUCIUS,14
Exit LUCIUS,14
Good night Titinius. Noble noble Cassius,14
O my dear brother!,14
Never come such division 'tween our souls!,14
Every thing is well.,14
Good night good brother.,14
Farewell every one.,14
Re-enter LUCIUS with the gown,14
Here in the tent.,14
Poor knave I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.,14
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.,14
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS,14
I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep;,14
On business to my brother Cassius.,14
I will not have it so: lie down good sirs;,14
Look Lucius here's the book I sought for so;,14
VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down,14
Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful.,14
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?,14
It does my boy:,14
It is my duty sir.,14
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.,14
It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;,14
I will be good to thee.,14
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,14
That plays thee music? Gentle knave good night;,14
If thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument;,14
Let me see let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down,14
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR,14
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes,14
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?,14
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?,14
Thy evil spirit Brutus.,14
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.,14
Ay at Philippi.,14
Exit Ghost,14
Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee.,14
The strings my lord are false.,14
Lucius awake!,14
Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out?,14
Yes that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?,14
Sleep again Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!,14
Fellow thou awake!,14
My lord?,14
Did we my lord?,14
No my lord I saw nothing.,14
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;,14
And we will follow.,14
Exeunt,14
SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.,14
Now Antony our hopes are answered:,14
But keep the hills and upper regions;,14
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,14
Tut I am in their bosoms and I know,14
To visit other places; and come down,14
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;,14
Enter a Messenger,14
The enemy comes on in gallant show;,14
And something to be done immediately.,14
Upon the left hand of the even field.,14
Why do you cross me in this exigent?,14
March,14
They stand and would have parley.,14
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle?,14
Make forth; the generals would have some words.,14
Words before blows: is it so countrymen?,14
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius.,14
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,14
Antony,14
But for your words they rob the Hybla bees,14
Not stingless too.,14
For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony,14
Villains you did not so when your vile daggers,14
You show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds,14
Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind,14
Flatterers! Now Brutus thank yourself:,14
If Cassius might have ruled.,14
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;,14
When think you that the sword goes up again?,14
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar,14
Caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands,14
So I hope;,14
O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,14
A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour,14
Old Cassius still!,14
Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth:,14
If not when you have stomachs.,14
Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark!,14
Ho Lucilius! hark a word with you.,14
BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart,14
[Standing forth]  What says my general?,14
This is my birth-day; as this very day,14
Be thou my witness that against my will,14
Upon one battle all our liberties.,14
And his opinion: now I change my mind,14
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign,14
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;,14
This morning are they fled away and gone;,14
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,14
A canopy most fatal under which,14
Believe not so.,14
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved,14
Even so Lucilius.,14
The gods to-day stand friendly that we may,14
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,14
If we do lose this battle then is this,14
What are you then determined to do?,14
By which I did blame Cato for the death,14
But I do find it cowardly and vile,14
The time of life: arming myself with patience,14
That govern us below.,14
You are contented to be led in triumph,14
No Cassius no: think not thou noble Roman,14
He bears too great a mind. But this same day,14
And whether we shall meet again I know not.,14
For ever and for ever farewell Cassius!,14
If not why then this parting was well made.,14
If we do meet again we'll smile indeed;,14
Why then lead on. O that a man might know,14
But it sufficeth that the day will end,14
Exeunt,14
Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA,14
Unto the legions on the other side.,14
Let them set on at once; for I perceive,14
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.,14
Exeunt,14
Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS,14
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:,14
I slew the coward and did take it from him.,14
Who having some advantage on Octavius,14
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.,14
Fly further off my lord fly further off;,14
Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off.,14
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?,14
Titinius if thou lovest me,14
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,14
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.,14
Exit,14
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,14
PINDARUS ascends the hill,14
And where I did begin there shall I end;,14
[Above]  O my lord!,14
[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about,14
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.,14
He's ta'en.,14
And hark! they shout for joy.,14
O coward that I am to live so long,14
PINDARUS descends,14
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;,14
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,14
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,14
Stand not to answer: here take thou the hilts;,14
Guide thou the sword.,14
Caesar thou art revenged,14
Dies,14
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,14
Where never Roman shall take note of him.,14
Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA,14
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,14
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.,14
All disconsolate,14
Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?,14
Is not that he?,14
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,14
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;,14
Clouds dews and dangers come; our deeds are done!,14
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.,14
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men,14
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,14
What Pindarus! where art thou Pindarus?,14
The noble Brutus thrusting this report,14
For piercing steel and darts envenomed,14
As tidings of this sight.,14
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.,14
Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius?,14
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,14
Alas thou hast misconstrued every thing!,14
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I,14
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.,14
Come Cassius' sword and find Titinius' heart.,14
Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA with BRUTUS CATO STRATO VOLUMNIUS and LUCILIUS,14
Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it.,14
He is slain.,14
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords,14
Low alarums,14
Look whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!,14
The last of all the Romans fare thee well!,14
Should breed thy fellow. Friends I owe more tears,14
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time.,14
His funerals shall not be in our camp,14
And come young Cato; let us to the field.,14
Tis three o'clock; and Romans yet ere night,14
Exeunt,14
Alarum. Enter fighting Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS CATO LUCILIUS and others,14
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?,14
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho!,14
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho!,14
Brutus my country's friend; know me for Brutus!,14
O young and noble Cato art thou down?,14
And mayst be honour'd being Cato's son.,14
Only I yield to die:,14
Offering money,14
We must not. A noble prisoner!,14
I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.,14
Brutus is ta'en Brutus is ta'en my lord.,14
Safe Antony; Brutus is safe enough:,14
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:,14
When you do find him or alive or dead,14
This is not Brutus friend; but I assure you,14
Give him all kindness: I had rather have,14
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;,14
How every thing is chanced.,14
SCENE V. Another part of the field.,14
Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock.,14
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.,14
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee Clitus.,14
What I my lord? No not for all the world.,14
I'll rather kill myself.,14
Whispers,14
O Dardanius!,14
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?,14
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,14
Come hither good Volumnius; list a word.,14
Why this Volumnius:,14
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,14
I know my hour is come.,14
Nay I am sure it is Volumnius.,14
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:,14
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,14
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:,14
Hold thou my sword-hilts whilst I run on it.,14
Alarum still,14
Farewell to you; and you; and you Volumnius.,14
Farewell to thee too Strato. Countrymen,14
I found no man but he was true to me.,14
More than Octavius and Mark Antony,14
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue,14
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,14
Alarum. Cry within 'Fly fly fly!',14
Hence! I will follow.,14
I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord:,14
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:,14
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou Strato?,14
Farewell good Strato.,14
Caesar now be still:,14
Dies,14
What man is that?,14
Free from the bondage you are in Messala:,14
For Brutus only overcame himself,14
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee Brutus,14
All that served Brutus I will entertain them.,14
Ay if Messala will prefer me to you.,14
How died my master Strato?,14
Octavius then take him to follow thee,14
This was the noblest Roman of them all:,14
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;,14
And common good to all made one of them.,14
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up,14
According to his virtue let us use him,14
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,14
So call the field to rest; and let's away,14
Exeunt,14
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.,15
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of,15
It did always seem so to us: but now in the,15
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so,15
of either's moiety.,15
His breeding sir hath been at my charge: I have,15
brazed to it.,15
Sir this young fellow's mother could: whereupon,15
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.,15
I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it,15
But I have sir a son by order of law some year,15
though this knave came something saucily into the,15
fair; there was good sport at his making and the,15
noble gentleman Edmund?,15
My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my,15
My services to your lordship.,15
Sir I shall study deserving.,15
again. The king is coming.,15
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester.,15
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND,15
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided,15
To shake all cares and business from our age;,15
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,15
We have this hour a constant will to publish,15
May be prevented now. The princes France and Burgundy,15
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,15
Since now we will divest us both of rule,15
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?,15
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,15
Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter;,15
Beyond what can be valued rich or rare;,15
As much as child e'er loved or father found;,15
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.,15
Love and be silent.,15
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,15
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue,15
Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall? Speak.,15
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,15
I find she names my very deed of love;,15
Myself an enemy to all other joys,15
And find I am alone felicitate,15
[Aside] Then poor Cordelia!,15
More richer than my tongue.,15
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;,15
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now our joy,15
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy,15
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.,15
Nothing!,15
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.,15
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty,15
How how Cordelia! mend your speech a little,15
Good my lord,15
Return those duties back as are right fit,15
Why have my sisters husbands if they say,15
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry,15
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,15
But goes thy heart with this?,15
So young and so untender?,15
Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:,15
The mysteries of Hecate and the night;,15
From whom we do exist and cease to be;,15
Propinquity and property of blood,15
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,15
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom,15
As thou my sometime daughter.,15
Peace Kent!,15
I loved her most and thought to set my rest,15
So be my grave my peace as here I give,15
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,15
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her.,15
Pre-eminence and all the large effects,15
With reservation of an hundred knights,15
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain,15
The sway revenue execution of the rest,15
This coronet part betwixt you.,15
Royal Lear,15
Loved as my father as my master follow'd,15
The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft.,15
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,15
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,15
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;,15
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,15
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound,15
Kent on thy life no more.,15
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,15
Out of my sight!,15
The true blank of thine eye.,15
Now by Apollo king,15
O vassal! miscreant!,15
Dear sir forbear.,15
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow,15
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,15
Hear me recreant!,15
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,15
To come between our sentence and our power,15
Our potency made good take thy reward.,15
To shield thee from diseases of the world;,15
Upon our kingdom: if on the tenth day following,15
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,15
Fare thee well king: sith thus thou wilt appear,15
To CORDELIA,15
That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!,15
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,15
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu;,15
Exit,15
Here's France and Burgundy my noble lord.,15
We first address towards you who with this king,15
Will you require in present dower with her,15
Most royal majesty,15
Nor will you tender less.,15
When she was dear to us we did hold her so;,15
If aught within that little seeming substance,15
And nothing more may fitly like your grace,15
I know no answer.,15
Unfriended new-adopted to our hate,15
Take her or leave her?,15
Election makes not up on such conditions.,15
I tell you all her wealth.,15
For you great king,15
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you,15
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed,15
This is most strange,15
The argument of your praise balm of your age,15
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle,15
Must be of such unnatural degree,15
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,15
Could never plant in me.,15
If for I want that glib and oily art,15
I'll do't before I speak--that you make known,15
No unchaste action or dishonour'd step,15
But even for want of that for which I am richer,15
As I am glad I have not though not to have it,15
Better thou,15
Is it but this--a tardiness in nature,15
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,15
When it is mingled with regards that stand,15
She is herself a dowry.,15
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,15
Duchess of Burgundy.,15
I am sorry then you have so lost a father,15
Peace be with Burgundy!,15
I shall not be his wife.,15
Most choice forsaken; and most loved despised!,15
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.,15
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.,15
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France:,15
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.,15
Thou losest here a better where to find.,15
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see,15
Without our grace our love our benison.,15
Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE GONERIL REGAN and CORDELIA,15
The jewels of our father with wash'd eyes,15
And like a sister am most loath to call,15
To your professed bosoms I commit him,15
I would prefer him to a better place.,15
Prescribe not us our duties.,15
Be to content your lord who hath received you,15
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.,15
Who cover faults at last shame them derides.,15
Come my fair Cordelia.,15
Sister it is not a little I have to say of what,15
father will hence to-night.,15
You see how full of changes his age is; the,15
little: he always loved our sister most; and,15
appears too grossly.,15
but slenderly known himself.,15
rash; then must we look to receive from his age,15
condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness,15
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from,15
There is further compliment of leavetaking,15
together: if our father carry authority with,15
surrender of his will but offend us.,15
We must do something and i' the heat.,15
SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.,15
Thou nature art my goddess; to thy law,15
Stand in the plague of custom and permit,15
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines,15
When my dimensions are as well compact,15
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us,15
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take,15
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed,15
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,15
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund,15
Well my legitimate if this letter speed,15
Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:,15
Enter GLOUCESTER,15
And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!,15
Upon the gad! Edmund how now! what news?,15
Putting up the letter,15
I know no news my lord.,15
Nothing my lord.,15
it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath,15
if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles.,15
from my brother that I have not all o'er-read;,15
fit for your o'er-looking.,15
I shall offend either to detain or give it. The,15
Let's see let's see.,15
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.,15
the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps,15
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage,15
as it hath power but as it is suffered. Come to,15
would sleep till I waked him you should half his,15
brother EDGAR.',15
should enjoy half his revenue'--My son Edgar!,15
to breed it in?--When came this to you? who,15
It was not brought me my lord; there's the,15
casement of my closet.,15
If the matter were good my lord I durst swear,15
fain think it were not.,15
It is his hand my lord; but I hope his heart is,15
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?,15
maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age,15
ward to the son and the son manage his revenue.,15
letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural detested,15
seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!,15
I do not well know my lord. If it shall please,15
brother till you can derive from him better,15
course; where if you violently proceed against,15
gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the,15
for him that he hath wrote this to feel my,15
pretence of danger.,15
If your honour judge it meet I will place you,15
auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and,15
He cannot be such a monster--,15
To his father that so tenderly and entirely,15
out: wind me into him I pray you: frame the,15
myself to be in a due resolution.,15
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.,15
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can,15
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,15
cities mutinies; in countries discord; in,15
and father. This villain of mine comes under the,15
falls from bias of nature; there's father against,15
machinations hollowness treachery and all,15
graves. Find out this villain Edmund; it shall,15
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his,15
Exit,15
when we are sick in fortune--often the surfeit,15
disasters the sun the moon and the stars: as,15
heavenly compulsion; knaves thieves and,15
liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of,15
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion,15
disposition to the charge of a star! My,15
dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa,15
lecherous. Tut I should have been that I am,15
twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--,15
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old,15
sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O these eclipses do,15
How now brother Edmund! what serious,15
I am thinking brother of a prediction I read,15
Do you busy yourself about that?,15
unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child,15
ancient amities; divisions in state menaces and,15
diffidences banishment of friends dissipation,15
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?,15
Why the night gone by.,15
Ay two hours together.,15
displeasure in him by word or countenance?,15
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended,15
till some little time hath qualified the heat of,15
in him that with the mischief of your person it,15
Some villain hath done me wrong.,15
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes,15
lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to,15
if you do stir abroad go armed.,15
Brother I advise you to the best; go armed: I,15
towards you: I have told you what I have seen,15
and horror of it: pray you away.,15
I do serve you in this business.,15
A credulous father! and a brother noble,15
That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty,15
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit:,15
Exit,15
Enter GONERIL and OSWALD her steward,15
Yes madam.,15
He flashes into one gross crime or other,15
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us,15
I will not speak with him; say I am sick:,15
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.,15
Horns within,15
You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:,15
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,15
That still would manage those authorities,15
Old fools are babes again; and must be used,15
Remember what I tell you.,15
And let his knights have colder looks among you;,15
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall,15
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.,15
SCENE IV. A hall in the same.,15
If but as well I other accents borrow,15
May carry through itself to that full issue,15
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,15
Shall find thee full of labours.,15
Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.,15
How now! what art thou?,15
What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?,15
him truly that will put me in trust: to love him,15
and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I,15
What art thou?,15
If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a,15
Service.,15
You.,15
No sir; but you have that in your countenance,15
What's that?,15
What services canst thou do?,15
tale in telling it and deliver a plain message,15
qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.,15
Not so young sir to love a woman for singing nor,15
on my back forty eight.,15
worse after dinner I will not part from thee yet.,15
Go you and call my fool hither.,15
Enter OSWALD,15
So please you--,15
What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.,15
Where's my fool ho? I think the world's asleep.,15
How now! where's that mongrel?,15
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.,15
not.,15
My lord I know not what the matter is; but to my,15
ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a,15
general dependants as in the duke himself also and,15
Ha! sayest thou so?,15
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your,15
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I,15
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity,15
I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I,15
Since my young lady's going into France sir the,15
No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and,15
Exit an Attendant,15
Exit an Attendant,15
O you sir you come you hither sir: who am I,15
My lady's father.,15
whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!,15
Do you bandy looks with me you rascal?,15
I'll not be struck my lord.,15
Tripping up his heels,15
love thee.,15
away away! if you will measure your lubber's,15
wisdom? so.,15
Now my friendly knave I thank thee: there's,15
Giving KENT money,15
Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.,15
How now my pretty knave! how dost thou?,15
Why fool?,15
nay an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,15
why this fellow has banished two on's daughters,15
thou follow him thou must needs wear my coxcomb.,15
Why my boy?,15
myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.,15
Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped,15
A pestilent gall to me!,15
Do.,15
Have more than thou showest,15
Lend less than thou owest,15
Learn more than thou trowest,15
Leave thy drink and thy whore,15
And thou shalt have more,15
This is nothing fool.,15
gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of,15
Why no boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.,15
his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.,15
Dost thou know the difference my boy between a,15
No lad; teach me.,15
To give away thy land,15
Do thou for him stand:,15
Will presently appear;,15
The other found out there.,15
All thy other titles thou hast given away; that,15
This is not altogether fool my lord.,15
I had a monopoly out they would have part on't:,15
to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,15
What two crowns shall they be?,15
up the meat the two crowns of the egg. When thou,15
both parts thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er,15
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak,15
finds it so.,15
Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;,15
They know not how their wits to wear,15
When were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah?,15
daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them,15
Singing,15
And I for sorrow sung,15
And go the fools among.,15
thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.,15
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:,15
have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am,15
kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be,15
and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o',15
Enter GONERIL,15
Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.,15
care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a,15
thou art nothing.,15
Yes forsooth I will hold my tongue; so your face,15
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,15
Pointing to KING LEAR,15
Not only sir this your all-licensed fool,15
Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth,15
I had thought by making this well known unto you,15
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.,15
By your allowance; which if you should the fault,15
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal,15
Which else were shame that then necessity,15
For you trow nuncle,15
That it's had it head bit off by it young.,15
Are you our daughter?,15
I would you would make use of that good wisdom,15
These dispositions that of late transform you,15
May not an ass know when the cart,15
Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:,15
Either his notion weakens his discernings,15
Who is it that can tell me who I am?,15
I would learn that; for by the,15
I should be false persuaded I had daughters.,15
Your name fair gentlewoman?,15
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you,15
As you are old and reverend you should be wise.,15
Men so disorder'd so debosh'd and bold,15
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust,15
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak,15
By her that else will take the thing she begs,15
And the remainder that shall still depend,15
And know themselves and you.,15
Saddle my horses; call my train together:,15
Yet have I left a daughter.,15
Make servants of their betters.,15
Woe that too late repents--,15
O sir are you come?,15
Ingratitude thou marble-hearted fiend,15
Than the sea-monster!,15
[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.,15
That all particulars of duty know,15
The worships of their name. O most small fault,15
That like an engine wrench'd my frame of nature,15
And added to the gall. O Lear Lear Lear!,15
Striking his head,15
My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant,15
It may be so my lord.,15
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend,15
Into her womb convey sterility!,15
And from her derogate body never spring,15
Create her child of spleen; that it may live,15
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;,15
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits,15
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is,15
Exit,15
Never afflict yourself to know the cause;,15
That dotage gives it.,15
What fifty of my followers at a clap!,15
What's the matter sir?,15
To GONERIL,15
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;,15
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!,15
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,15
And cast you with the waters that you lose,15
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,15
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails,15
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think,15
I warrant thee.,15
Do you mark that my lord?,15
To the great love I bear you--,15
To the Fool,15
Nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarry and take the fool,15
A fox when one has caught her,15
Should sure to the slaughter,15
So the fool follows after.,15
This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!,15
At point a hundred knights: yes that on every dream,15
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,15
Well you may fear too far.,15
Let me still take away the harms I fear,15
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister,15
When I have show'd the unfitness--,15
How now Oswald!,15
Yes madam.,15
Inform her full of my particular fear;,15
As may compact it more. Get you gone;,15
Exit OSWALD,15
This milky gentleness and course of yours,15
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom,15
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:,15
Nay then--,15
Exeunt,15
Enter KING LEAR KENT and Fool,15
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you,15
If your diligence be not speedy I shall be there afore you.,15
your letter.,15
If a man's brains were in's heels were't not in,15
Ay boy.,15
slip-shod.,15
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;,15
apple yet I can tell what I can tell.,15
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a,15
the middle on's face?,15
Why to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that,15
I did her wrong--,15
No.,15
Why?,15
daughters and leave his horns without a case.,15
horses ready?,15
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.,15
Yes indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.,15
If thou wert my fool nuncle I'ld have thee beaten,15
How's that?,15
been wise.,15
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!,15
How now! are the horses ready?,15
Come boy.,15
Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter.,15
ACT II,15
Enter EDMUND and CURAN meets him,15
And you sir. I have been with your father and,15
his duchess will be here with him this night.,15
Nay I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;,15
ear-kissing arguments?,15
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the,15
Not a word.,15
Exit,15
This weaves itself perforce into my business.,15
And I have one thing of a queasy question,15
Brother a word; descend: brother I say!,15
My father watches: O sir fly this place;,15
You have now the good advantage of the night:,15
He's coming hither: now i' the night i' the haste,15
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?,15
I am sure on't not a word.,15
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you,15
Yield: come before my father. Light ho here!,15
Exit EDGAR,15
Wounds his arm,15
Do more than this in sport. Father father!,15
Enter GLOUCESTER and Servants with torches,15
Here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out,15
To stand auspicious mistress--,15
Look sir I bleed.,15
Fled this way sir. When by no means he could--,15
Exeunt some Servants,15
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;,15
Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;,15
The child was bound to the father; sir in fine,15
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion,15
My unprovided body lanced mine arm:,15
Bold in the quarrel's right roused to the encounter,15
Full suddenly he fled.,15
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;,15
My worthy arch and patron comes to-night:,15
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,15
He that conceals him death.,15
And found him pight to do it with curst speech,15
Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,15
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee,15
As this I would: ay though thou didst produce,15
To thy suggestion plot and damned practise:,15
If they not thought the profits of my death,15
To make thee seek it.',15
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.,15
Hark the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.,15
The duke must grant me that: besides his picture,15
May have the due note of him; and of my land,15
To make thee capable.,15
How now my noble friend! since I came hither,15
If it be true all vengeance comes too short,15
O madam my old heart is crack'd it's crack'd!,15
He whom my father named? your Edgar?,15
Was he not companion with the riotous knights,15
I know not madam: 'tis too bad too bad.,15
No marvel then though he were ill affected:,15
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.,15
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,15
I'll not be there.,15
Edmund I hear that you have shown your father,15
Twas my duty sir.,15
This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.,15
Ay my good lord.,15
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,15
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant,15
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;,15
I shall serve you sir,15
For him I thank your grace.,15
Thus out of season threading dark-eyed night:,15
Wherein we must have use of your advice:,15
Of differences which I least thought it fit,15
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,15
Your needful counsel to our business,15
I serve you madam:,15
Exeunt,15
Enter KENT and OSWALD severally,15
Ay.,15
I' the mire.,15
I love thee not.,15
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold I would make thee,15
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.,15
What dost thou know me for?,15
base proud shallow beggarly three-suited,15
lily-livered action-taking knave a whoreson,15
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a,15
the composition of a knave beggar coward pandar,15
will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest,15
Why what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail,15
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou,15
thy heels and beat thee before the king? Draw you,15
shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:,15
Drawing his sword,15
Draw you rascal: you come with letters against the,15
royalty of her father: draw you rogue or I'll so,15
Help ho! murder! help!,15
slave strike.,15
Help ho! murder! murder!,15
How now! What's the matter?,15
flesh ye; come on young master.,15
Keep peace upon your lives:,15
The messengers from our sister and the king.,15
I am scarce in breath my lord.,15
cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee: a,15
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?,15
not have made him so ill though he had been but two,15
Speak yet how grew your quarrel?,15
at suit of his gray beard--,15
lord if you will give me leave I will tread this,15
a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard you wagtail?,15
You beastly knave know you no reverence?,15
Why art thou angry?,15
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,15
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion,15
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods;,15
With every gale and vary of their masters,15
A plague upon your epileptic visage!,15
Goose if I had you upon Sarum plain,15
Why art thou mad old fellow?,15
No contraries hold more antipathy,15
Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?,15
No more perchance does mine nor his nor hers.,15
I have seen better faces in my time,15
Before me at this instant.,15
Who having been praised for bluntness doth affect,15
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter he,15
An they will take it so; if not he's plain.,15
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends,15
That stretch their duties nicely.,15
Under the allowance of your great aspect,15
On flickering Phoebus' front--,15
To go out of my dialect which you,15
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain,15
I will not be though I should win your displeasure,15
What was the offence you gave him?,15
It pleased the king his master very late,15
When he conjunct and flattering his displeasure,15
And put upon him such a deal of man,15
For him attempting who was self-subdued;,15
Drew on me here again.,15
But Ajax is their fool.,15
You stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart,15
Sir I am too old to learn:,15
On whose employment I was sent to you:,15
Against the grace and person of my master,15
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,15
Till noon! till night my lord; and all night too.,15
You should not use me so.,15
This is a fellow of the self-same colour,15
Stocks brought out,15
His fault is much and the good king his master,15
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches,15
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,15
Should have him thus restrain'd.,15
My sister may receive it much more worse,15
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.,15
Come my good lord away.,15
I am sorry for thee friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,15
Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.,15
Some time I shall sleep out the rest I'll whistle.,15
Give you good morrow!,15
Exit,15
Thou out of heaven's benediction comest,15
Approach thou beacon to this under globe,15
Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles,15
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd,15
From this enormous state seeking to give,15
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold,15
Fortune good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!,15
SCENE III. A wood.,15
I heard myself proclaim'd;,15
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,15
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,15
To take the basest and most poorest shape,15
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;,15
And with presented nakedness out-face,15
The country gives me proof and precedent,15
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms,15
And with this horrible object from low farms,15
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers,15
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.,15
SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.,15
Tis strange that they should so depart from home,15
As I learn'd,15
Of this remove.,15
Ha!,15
No my lord.,15
by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by,15
over-lusty at legs then he wears wooden,15
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook,15
It is both he and she;,15
No.,15
No I say.,15
No no they would not.,15
By Jupiter I swear no.,15
They durst not do 't;,15
To do upon respect such violent outrage:,15
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,15
My lord when at their home,15
Ere I was risen from the place that show'd,15
Stew'd in his haste half breathless panting forth,15
Deliver'd letters spite of intermission,15
They summon'd up their meiny straight took horse;,15
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:,15
Whose welcome I perceived had poison'd mine--,15
Display'd so saucily against your highness--,15
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.,15
The shame which here it suffers.,15
Fathers that wear rags,15
But fathers that bear bags,15
Fortune that arrant whore,15
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours,15
O how this mother swells up toward my heart!,15
Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?,15
Follow me not;,15
Exit,15
None.,15
And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that,15
Why fool?,15
there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow,15
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him,15
runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with,15
hill let him draw thee after. When a wise man,15
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it.,15
And follows but for form,15
And leave thee in the storm,15
And let the wise man fly:,15
The fool no knave perdy.,15
Not i' the stocks fool.,15
Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?,15
The images of revolt and flying off.,15
My dear lord,15
How unremoveable and fix'd he is,15
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!,15
I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.,15
Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me man?,15
The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father,15
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!,15
No but not yet: may be he is not well:,15
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves,15
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;,15
To take the indisposed and sickly fit,15
Looking on KENT,15
That this remotion of the duke and her,15
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,15
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum,15
I would have all well betwixt you.,15
O me my heart my rising heart! but down!,15
when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em,15
wantons down!' 'Twas her brother that in pure,15
Enter CORNWALL REGAN GLOUCESTER and Servants,15
Hail to your grace!,15
I am glad to see your highness.,15
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,15
Sepulchring an adultress.,15
O are you free?,15
Thy sister's naught: O Regan she hath tied,15
Points to his heart,15
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!,15
You less know how to value her desert,15
Say how is that?,15
Would fail her obligation: if sir perchance,15
Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end,15
My curses on her!,15
Nature in you stands on the very verge,15
By some discretion that discerns your state,15
That to our sister you do make return;,15
Ask her forgiveness?,15
Dear daughter I confess that I am old;,15
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg,15
Good sir no more; these are unsightly tricks:,15
[Rising]  Never Regan:,15
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,15
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall,15
You taking airs with lameness!,15
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames,15
You fen-suck'd fogs drawn by the powerful sun,15
O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,15
No Regan thou shalt never have my curse:,15
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine,15
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train,15
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt,15
The offices of nature bond of childhood,15
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,15
Good sir to the purpose.,15
Tucket within,15
I know't my sister's: this approves her letter,15
Enter OSWALD,15
This is a slave whose easy-borrow'd pride,15
Out varlet from my sight!,15
Who stock'd my servant? Regan I have good hope,15
Enter GONERIL,15
Allow obedience if yourselves are old,15
To GONERIL,15
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand?,15
All's not offence that indiscretion finds,15
O sides you are too tough;,15
I set him there sir: but his own disorders,15
You! did you?,15
If till the expiration of your month,15
Dismissing half your train come then to me:,15
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.,15
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose,15
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl--,15
Why the hot-blooded France that dowerless took,15
To knee his throne and squire-like; pension beg,15
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter,15
Pointing at OSWALD,15
I prithee daughter do not make me mad:,15
We'll no more meet no more see one another:,15
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,15
A plague-sore an embossed carbuncle,15
Let shame come when it will I do not call it:,15
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:,15
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,15
Not altogether so:,15
For your fit welcome. Give ear sir to my sister;,15
Must be content to think you old and so--,15
Is this well spoken?,15
Is it not well? What should you need of more?,15
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house,15
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.,15
From those that she calls servants or from mine?,15
We could control them. If you will come to me--,15
To bring but five and twenty: to no more,15
I gave you all--,15
Made you my guardians my depositaries;,15
With such a number. What must I come to you,15
And speak't again my lord; no more with me.,15
When others are more wicked: not being the worst,15
To GONERIL,15
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,15
Hear me my lord;,15
To follow in a house where twice so many,15
What need one?,15
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:,15
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;,15
Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,15
You heavens give me that patience patience I need!,15
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!,15
Against their father fool me not so much,15
And let not women's weapons water-drops,15
I will have such revenges on you both,15
What they are yet I know not: but they shall be,15
No I'll not weep:,15
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,15
Exeunt KING LEAR GLOUCESTER KENT and Fool,15
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.,15
Cannot be well bestow'd.,15
And must needs taste his folly.,15
But not one follower.,15
Where is my lord of Gloucester?,15
Re-enter GLOUCESTER,15
Whither is he going?,15
Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.,15
Alack the night comes on and the bleak winds,15
There's scarce a bush.,15
The injuries that they themselves procure,15
He is attended with a desperate train;,15
To have his ear abused wisdom bids fear.,15
My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.,15
ACT III,15
Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman meeting,15
One minded like the weather most unquietly.,15
Contending with the fretful element:,15
Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,15
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage,15
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn,15
This night wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,15
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs,15
But who is with him?,15
His heart-struck injuries.,15
And dare upon the warrant of my note,15
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd,15
Who have--as who have not that their great stars,15
Which are to France the spies and speculations,15
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,15
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,15
But true it is from France there comes a power,15
Wise in our negligence have secret feet,15
To show their open banner. Now to you:,15
To make your speed to Dover you shall find,15
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow,15
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;,15
This office to you.,15
No do not.,15
Than my out-wall open this purse and take,15
As fear not but you shall--show her this ring;,15
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!,15
Give me your hand: have you no more to say?,15
That when we have found the king--in which your pain,15
Holla the other.,15
SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.,15
Blow winds and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!,15
Till you have drench'd our steeples drown'd the cocks!,15
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,15
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!,15
That make ingrateful man!,15
house is better than this rain-water out o' door.,15
here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.,15
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters:,15
I never gave you kingdom call'd you children,15
Your horrible pleasure: here I stand your slave,15
But yet I call you servile ministers,15
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head,15
He that has a house to put's head in has a good,15
The cod-piece that will house,15
The head and he shall louse;,15
The man that makes his toe,15
Shall of a corn cry woe,15
For there was never yet fair woman but she made,15
No I will be the pattern of all patience;,15
Enter KENT,15
Marry here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise,15
Alas sir are you here? things that love night,15
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,15
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder,15
Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry,15
Let the great gods,15
Find out their enemies now. Tremble thou wretch,15
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee thou bloody hand;,15
That art incestuous: caitiff to pieces shake,15
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,15
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man,15
Alack bare-headed!,15
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:,15
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;,15
Denied me to come in--return and force,15
My wits begin to turn.,15
I am cold myself. Where is this straw my fellow?,15
That can make vile things precious. Come,15
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart,15
[Singing],15
With hey ho the wind and the rain--,15
For the rain it raineth every day.,15
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT,15
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:,15
When brewers mar their malt with water;,15
No heretics burn'd but wenches' suitors;,15
No squire in debt nor no poor knight;,15
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;,15
And bawds and whores do churches build;,15
Come to great confusion:,15
That going shall be used with feet.,15
Exit,15
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND,15
dealing. When I desire their leave that I might,15
house; charged me on pain of their perpetual,15
him nor any way sustain him.,15
Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt,15
received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be,15
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged,15
must incline to the king. I will seek him and,15
the duke that my charity be not of him perceived:,15
Though I die for it as no less is threatened me,15
some strange thing toward Edmund; pray you be careful.,15
This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke,15
This seems a fair deserving and must draw me,15
The younger rises when the old doth fall.,15
SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.,15
Here is the place my lord; good my lord enter:,15
For nature to endure.,15
Let me alone.,15
Wilt break my heart?,15
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm,15
But where the greater malady is fix'd,15
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,15
mind's free,15
Doth from my senses take all feeling else,15
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand,15
No I will weep no more. In such a night,15
In such a night as this! O Regan Goneril!,15
O that way madness lies; let me shun that;,15
Good my lord enter here.,15
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder,15
To the Fool,15
Nay get thee in. I'll pray and then I'll sleep.,15
Poor naked wretches whereso'er you are,15
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,15
From seasons such as these? O I have ta'en,15
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,15
And show the heavens more just.,15
The Fool runs out from the hovel,15
Help me help me!,15
A spirit a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.,15
Come forth.,15
Away! the foul fiend follows me!,15
Hum! go to thy cold bed and warm thee.,15
And art thou come to this?,15
fiend hath led through fire and through flame and,15
that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters,15
proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting-horse over,15
traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold--O do,15
star-blasting and taking! Do poor Tom some,15
have him now--and there--and there again and there.,15
What have his daughters brought him to this pass?,15
Nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all shamed.,15
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!,15
Death traitor! nothing could have subdued nature,15
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers,15
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot,15
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:,15
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.,15
keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with,15
array. Tom's a-cold.,15
A serving-man proud in heart and mind; that curled,15
my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with,15
broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that,15
wine loved I deeply dice dearly: and in woman,15
ear bloody of hand; hog in sloth fox in stealth,15
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of,15
out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy pen,15
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:,15
Dolphin my boy my boy sessa! let him trot by.,15
Why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer,15
Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou,15
no wool the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on,15
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,15
come unbutton here.,15
Prithee nuncle be contented; 'tis a naughty night,15
like an old lecher's heart; a small spark all the,15
Enter GLOUCESTER with a torch,15
at curfew and walks till the first cock; he gives,15
hare-lip; mildews the white wheat and hurts the,15
S. Withold footed thrice the old;,15
Bid her alight,15
And aroint thee witch aroint thee!,15
What's he?,15
What are you there? Your names?,15
the tadpole the wall-newt and the water; that in,15
eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and,15
standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to,15
hath had three suits to his back six shirts to his,15
But mice and rats and such small deer,15
Beware my follower. Peace Smulkin; peace thou fiend!,15
The prince of darkness is a gentleman:,15
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile my lord,15
Poor Tom's a-cold.,15
To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:,15
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,15
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.,15
What is the cause of thunder?,15
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.,15
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.,15
Importune him once more to go my lord;,15
Canst thou blame him?,15
His daughters seek his death: ah that good Kent!,15
Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee friend,15
Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,15
No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,15
I do beseech your grace--,15
Noble philosopher your company.,15
In fellow there into the hovel: keep thee warm.,15
This way my lord.,15
I will keep still with my philosopher.,15
Take him you on.,15
Come good Athenian.,15
Child Rowland to the dark tower came,15
I smell the blood of a British man.,15
SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.,15
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.,15
gives way to loyalty something fears me to think,15
I now perceive it was not altogether your,15
but a provoking merit set a-work by a reprovable,15
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to,15
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages,15
or not I the detector!,15
If the matter of this paper be certain you have,15
True or false it hath made thee earl of,15
may be ready for our apprehension.,15
stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in,15
between that and my blood.,15
dearer father in my love.,15
SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.,15
Here is better than the open air; take it,15
addition I can: I will not be long from you.,15
impatience: the gods reward your kindness!,15
Frateretto calls me; and tells me,15
Pray innocent and beware the foul fiend.,15
gentleman or a yeoman?,15
No he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;,15
before him.,15
Come hissing in upon 'em--,15
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a,15
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.,15
Come sit thou here most learned justicer;,15
Thou sapient sir sit here. Now you she foxes!,15
Wantest thou eyes at trial madam?,15
Her boat hath a leak,15
Why she dares not come over to thee.,15
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two,15
food for thee.,15
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?,15
To EDGAR,15
To the Fool,15
Bench by his side:,15
you are o' the commission,15
Let us deal justly.,15
Thy sheep be in the corn;,15
Thy sheep shall take no harm.,15
Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my,15
poor king her father.,15
She cannot deny it.,15
And here's another whose warp'd looks proclaim,15
Arms arms sword fire! Corruption in the place!,15
Bless thy five wits!,15
That thou so oft have boasted to retain?,15
They'll mar my counterfeiting.,15
Sweet-heart see they bark at me.,15
Be thy mouth or black or white,15
Mastiff grey-hound mongrel grim,15
Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,15
For with throwing thus my head,15
Do de de de. Sessa! Come march to wakes and,15
Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds,15
makes these hard hearts?,15
You sir I entertain for one of my hundred; only I,15
say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.,15
Make no noise make no noise; draw the curtains:,15
And I'll go to bed at noon.,15
Come hither friend: where is the king my master?,15
Good friend I prithee take him in thy arms;,15
There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,15
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:,15
With thine and all that offer to defend him,15
And follow me that will to some provision,15
Oppressed nature sleeps:,15
Which if convenience will not allow,15
To the Fool,15
Thou must not stay behind.,15
Exeunt all but EDGAR,15
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.,15
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:,15
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.,15
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,15
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,15
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.,15
Lurk lurk.,15
SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.,15
Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him,15
out the villain Gloucester.,15
Hang him instantly.,15
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund keep you our,15
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your,15
a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the,15
betwixt us. Farewell dear sister: farewell my,15
Enter OSWALD,15
My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:,15
Hot questrists after him met him at gate;,15
Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast,15
Get horses for your mistress.,15
Edmund farewell.,15
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,15
Exeunt other Servants,15
Without the form of justice yet our power,15
May blame but not control. Who's there? the traitor?,15
Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.,15
What mean your graces? Good my friends consider,15
Bind him I say.,15
Hard hard. O filthy traitor!,15
To this chair bind him. Villain thou shalt find--,15
By the kind gods 'tis most ignobly done,15
So white and such a traitor!,15
These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin,15
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours,15
Come sir what letters had you late from France?,15
And what confederacy have you with the traitors,15
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.,15
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,15
Cunning.,15
Where hast thou sent the king?,15
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--,15
I am tied to the stake and I must stand the course.,15
Because I would not see thy cruel nails,15
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.,15
In hell-black night endured would have buoy'd up,15
Yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain.,15
Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter turn the key',15
The winged vengeance overtake such children.,15
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.,15
Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!,15
If you see vengeance--,15
I have served you ever since I was a child;,15
Than now to bid you hold.,15
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,15
My villain!,15
Nay then come on and take the chance of anger.,15
Takes a sword and runs at him behind,15
To see some mischief on him. O!,15
Lest it see more prevent it. Out vile jelly!,15
All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?,15
To quit this horrid act.,15
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he,15
Who is too good to pity thee.,15
Kind gods forgive me that and prosper him!,15
His way to Dover.,15
How is't my lord? how look you?,15
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave,15
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.,15
I'll never care what wickedness I do,15
If she live long,15
Women will all turn monsters.,15
To lead him where he would: his roguish madness,15
Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs,15
Exeunt severally,15
SCENE I. The heath.,15
Yet better thus and known to be contemn'd,15
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,15
The lamentable change is from the best;,15
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!,15
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?,15
My father poorly led? World world O world!,15
Lie would not yield to age.,15
your father's tenant these fourscore years.,15
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;,15
Alack sir you cannot see your way.,15
I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,15
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,15
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,15
How now! Who's there?,15
the worst'?,15
Tis poor mad Tom.,15
So long as we can say  'This is the worst.',15
Is it a beggar-man?,15
He has some reason else he could not beg.,15
Which made me think a man a worm: my son,15
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard,15
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods.,15
[Aside] How should this be?,15
Angering itself and others.--Bless thee master!,15
Ay my lord.,15
Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain,15
And bring some covering for this naked soul,15
Alack sir he is mad.,15
Do as I bid thee or rather do thy pleasure;,15
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,15
Exit,15
Poor Tom's a-cold.,15
I cannot daub it further.,15
[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes they bleed.,15
Both stile and gate horse-way and foot-path. Poor,15
thee good man's son from the foul fiend! five,15
Obidicut; Hobbididence prince of dumbness; Mahu of,15
mopping and mowing who since possesses chambermaids,15
Here take this purse thou whom the heavens' plagues,15
Makes thee the happier: heavens deal so still!,15
That slaves your ordinance that will not see,15
So distribution should undo excess,15
Ay master.,15
Looks fearfully in the confined deep:,15
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear,15
I shall no leading need.,15
Poor Tom shall lead thee.,15
SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.,15
Welcome my lord: I marvel our mild husband,15
Enter OSWALD,15
Madam within; but never man so changed.,15
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:,15
And of the loyal service of his son,15
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:,15
What like offensive.,15
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,15
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way,15
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:,15
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant,15
If you dare venture in your own behalf,15
Giving a favour,15
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:,15
Yours in the ranks of death.,15
Exit EDMUND,15
To thee a woman's services are due:,15
Madam here comes my lord.,15
Enter ALBANY,15
O Goneril!,15
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:,15
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;,15
From her material sap perforce must wither,15
No more; the text is foolish.,15
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?,15
A father and a gracious aged man,15
Most barbarous most degenerate! have you madded.,15
A man a prince by him so benefited!,15
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,15
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,15
Milk-liver'd man!,15
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning,15
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd,15
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;,15
Whiles thou a moral fool sit'st still and criest,15
See thyself devil!,15
So horrid as in woman.,15
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing for shame,15
To let these hands obey my blood,15
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,15
Marry your manhood now--,15
What news?,15
Slain by his servant going to put out,15
Gloucester's eye!,15
Opposed against the act bending his sword,15
Flew on him and amongst them fell'd him dead;,15
Hath pluck'd him after.,15
You justicers that these our nether crimes,15
Lost he his other eye?,15
This letter madam craves a speedy answer;,15
[Aside]              One way I like this well;,15
May all the building in my fancy pluck,15
The news is not so tart.--I'll read and answer.,15
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?,15
He is not here.,15
Knows he the wickedness?,15
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment,15
Gloucester I live,15
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither friend:,15
Exeunt,15
Enter KENT and a Gentleman,15
know you the reason?,15
state which since his coming forth is thought,15
fear and danger that his personal return was,15
Who hath he left behind him general?,15
Did your letters pierce the queen to any,15
Ay sir; she took them read them in my presence;,15
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen,15
Sought to be king o'er her.,15
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove,15
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears,15
That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know,15
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,15
If all could so become it.,15
Faith once or twice she heaved the name of 'father',15
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!,15
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook,15
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started,15
It is the stars,15
Else one self mate and mate could not beget,15
No.,15
No since.,15
Who sometime in his better tune remembers,15
Will yield to see his daughter.,15
A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,15
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights,15
His mind so venomously that burning shame,15
Alack poor gentleman!,15
Tis so they are afoot.,15
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause,15
When I am known aright you shall not grieve,15
Along with me.,15
SCENE IV. The same. A tent.,15
Alack 'tis he: why he was met even now,15
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,15
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow,15
Search every acre in the high-grown field,15
Exit an Officer,15
In the restoring his bereaved sense?,15
There is means madam:,15
The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,15
Will close the eye of anguish.,15
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,15
In the good man's distress! Seek seek for him;,15
That wants the means to lead it.,15
News madam;,15
Tis known before; our preparation stands,15
It is thy business that I go about;,15
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.,15
But love dear love and our aged father's right:,15
Exeunt,15
Enter REGAN and OSWALD,15
Ay madam.,15
Madam with much ado:,15
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?,15
What might import my sister's letter to him?,15
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter.,15
To let him live: where he arrives he moves,15
In pity of his misery to dispatch,15
The strength o' the enemy.,15
Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;,15
I may not madam:,15
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you,15
Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,15
Madam I had rather--,15
I am sure of that: and at her late being here,15
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.,15
I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:,15
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;,15
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.,15
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,15
So fare you well.,15
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.,15
What party I do follow.,15
Exeunt,15
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDGAR dressed like a peasant,15
You do climb up it now: look how we labour.,15
Horrible steep.,15
No truly.,15
By your eyes' anguish.,15
Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st,15
You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed,15
Methinks you're better spoken.,15
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!,15
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down,15
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:,15
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,15
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,15
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;,15
Topple down headlong.,15
Give me your hand: you are now within a foot,15
Would I not leap upright.,15
Here friend 's another purse; in it a jewel,15
Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;,15
Now fare you well good sir.,15
Why I do trifle thus with his despair,15
[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!,15
Shake patiently my great affliction off:,15
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,15
Burn itself out. If Edgar live O bless him!,15
He falls forward,15
And yet I know not how conceit may rob,15
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,15
Ho you sir! friend! Hear you sir! speak!,15
What are you sir?,15
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air,15
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;,15
Ten masts at each make not the altitude,15
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.,15
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.,15
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.,15
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,15
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,15
Give me your arm:,15
Too well too well.,15
Upon the crown o' the cliff what thing was that,15
A poor unfortunate beggar.,15
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,15
It was some fiend; therefore thou happy father,15
Of men's impossibilities have preserved thee.,15
Affliction till it do cry out itself,15
I took it for a man; often 'twould say,15
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?,15
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate,15
No they cannot touch me for coining; I am the,15
O thou side-piercing sight!,15
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a,15
look a mouse! Peace peace; this piece of toasted,15
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O well,15
Give the word.,15
Pass.,15
Ha! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered,15
beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay',15
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to,15
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I,15
not men o' their words: they told me I was every,15
The trick of that voice I do well remember:,15
Ay every inch a king:,15
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?,15
The wren goes to 't and the small gilded fly,15
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son,15
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.,15
Behold yond simpering dame,15
That minces virtue and does shake the head,15
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to 't,15
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,15
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,15
There's hell there's darkness there's the,15
Burning scalding stench consumption; fie,15
good apothecary to sweeten my imagination:,15
O let me kiss that hand!,15
O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world,15
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny,15
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the,15
Were all the letters suns I could not see one.,15
And my heart breaks at it.,15
What with the case of eyes?,15
head nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in,15
this world goes.,15
What art mad? A man may see how this world goes,15
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in,15
is the justice which is the thief? Thou hast seen,15
Ay sir.,15
mightst behold the great image of authority: a,15
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand!,15
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind,15
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;,15
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:,15
None does offend none I say none; I'll able 'em:,15
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;,15
To see the things thou dost not. Now now now now:,15
O matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!,15
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:,15
Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air,15
Alack alack the day!,15
To this great stage of fools: this a good block;,15
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;,15
Then kill kill kill kill kill kill!,15
O here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,15
No rescue? What a prisoner? I am even,15
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;,15
You shall have any thing.,15
Why this would make a man a man of salt,15
Ay and laying autumn's dust.,15
I will die bravely like a bridegroom. What!,15
My masters know you that.,15
Then there's life in't. Nay if you get it you,15
Exit running; Attendants follow,15
Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,15
Which twain have brought her to.,15
Sir speed you: what's your will?,15
Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,15
But by your favour,15
Near and on speedy foot; the main descry,15
I thank you sir: that's all.,15
Her army is moved on.,15
Exit Gentleman,15
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again,15
Well pray you father.,15
A most poor man made tame to fortune's blows;,15
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,15
Hearty thanks:,15
To boot and boot!,15
A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!,15
To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,15
That must destroy thee.,15
Put strength enough to't.,15
Wherefore bold peasant,15
Lest that the infection of his fortune take,15
Ch'ill not let go zir without vurther 'casion.,15
Good gentleman go your gait and let poor volk,15
twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.,15
ye or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be,15
Out dunghill!,15
your foins.,15
Slave thou hast slain me: villain take my purse:,15
And give the letters which thou find'st about me,15
Upon the British party: O untimely death!,15
I know thee well: a serviceable villain;,15
As badness would desire.,15
Sit you down father; rest you,15
May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry,15
Leave gentle wax; and manners blame us not:,15
Their papers is more lawful.,15
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have,15
want not time and place will be fruitfully offered.,15
then am I the prisoner and his bed my goal; from,15
the place for your labour.,15
Affectionate servant,15
O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!,15
And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands,15
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time,15
Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well,15
The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,15
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:,15
And woes by wrong imaginations lose,15
Give me your hand:,15
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum:,15
Exeunt,15
soft music playing; Gentleman and others attending.,15
O thou good Kent how shall I live and work,15
And every measure fail me.,15
All my reports go with the modest truth;,15
Be better suited:,15
I prithee put them off.,15
Yet to be known shortens my made intent:,15
Till time and I think meet.,15
To the Doctor,15
Madam sleeps still.,15
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!,15
Of this child-changed father!,15
That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.,15
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?,15
We put fresh garments on him.,15
I doubt not of his temperance.,15
Please you draw near. Louder the music there!,15
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss,15
Have in thy reverence made!,15
Had you not been their father these white flakes,15
To be opposed against the warring winds?,15
In the most terrible and nimble stroke,15
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,15
Against my fire; and wast thou fain poor father,15
In short and musty straw? Alack alack!,15
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.,15
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?,15
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound,15
Do scald like moulten lead.,15
You are a spirit I know: when did you die?,15
He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.,15
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,15
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;,15
Of my condition!,15
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:,15
Pray do not mock me:,15
Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less;,15
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.,15
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant,15
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not,15
For as I am a man I think this lady,15
And so I am I am.,15
If you have poison for me I will drink it.,15
Have as I do remember done me wrong:,15
No cause no cause.,15
In your own kingdom sir.,15
Be comforted good madam: the great rage,15
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.,15
Till further settling.,15
You must bear with me:,15
Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman,15
Most certain sir.,15
As 'tis said the bastard son of Gloucester.,15
of Kent in Germany.,15
powers of the kingdom approach apace.,15
well sir.,15
My point and period will be throughly wrought,15
Exit,15
SCENE I. The British camp near Dover.,15
Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,15
To change the course: he's full of alteration,15
To a Gentleman who goes out,15
Tis to be doubted madam.,15
You know the goodness I intend upon you:,15
Do you not love my sister?,15
But have you never found my brother's way,15
That thought abuses you.,15
And bosom'd with her as far as we call hers.,15
I never shall endure her: dear my lord,15
Fear me not:,15
Enter with drum and colours ALBANY GONERIL and Soldiers,15
Should loosen him and me.,15
Sir this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,15
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,15
It toucheth us as France invades our land,15
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.,15
Why is this reason'd?,15
For these domestic and particular broils,15
Let's then determine,15
I shall attend you presently at your tent.,15
No.,15
[Aside]  O ho I know the riddle.--I will go.,15
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,15
I'll overtake you. Speak.,15
Before you fight the battle ope this letter.,15
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,15
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,15
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.,15
I was forbid it.,15
And I'll appear again.,15
Exit EDGAR,15
The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.,15
By diligent discovery; but your haste,15
We will greet the time.,15
To both these sisters have I sworn my love;,15
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?,15
If both remain alive: to take the widow,15
And hardly shall I carry out my side,15
His countenance for the battle; which being done,15
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy,15
The battle done and they within our power,15
Stands on me to defend not to debate.,15
SCENE II. A field between the two camps.,15
Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER,15
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:,15
I'll bring you comfort.,15
Exit EDGAR,15
Away old man; give me thy hand; away!,15
Give me thy hand; come on.,15
What in ill thoughts again? Men must endure,15
Ripeness is all: come on.,15
Exeunt,15
Enter in conquest with drum and colours EDMUND  KING LEAR and CORDELIA prisoners; Captain Soldiers  and c,15
Until their greater pleasures first be known,15
We are not the first,15
For thee oppressed king am I cast down;,15
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?,15
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:,15
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,15
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues,15
Who loses and who wins; who's in who's out;,15
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,15
That ebb and flow by the moon.,15
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia,15
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,15
The good-years shall devour them flesh and fell,15
first. Come.,15
Come hither captain; hark.,15
Giving a paper,15
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost,15
To noble fortunes: know thou this that men,15
Does not become a sword: thy great employment,15
Or thrive by other means.,15
About it; and write happy when thou hast done.,15
As I have set it down.,15
If it be man's work I'll do 't.,15
Flourish. Enter ALBANY GONERIL REGAN another Captain and Soldiers,15
And fortune led you well: you have the captives,15
We do require them of you so to use them,15
May equally determine.,15
To send the old and miserable king,15
Whose age has charms in it whose title more,15
An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes,15
My reason all the same; and they are ready,15
Where you shall hold your session. At this time,15
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed,15
The question of Cordelia and her father,15
Sir by your patience,15
Not as a brother.,15
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,15
Bore the commission of my place and person;,15
And call itself your brother.,15
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,15
In my rights,15
That were the most if he should husband you.,15
Holla holla!,15
Lady I am not well; else I should answer,15
Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony;,15
Witness the world that I create thee here,15
Mean you to enjoy him?,15
Nor in thine lord.,15
[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike and prove my title thine.,15
On capital treason; and in thine attaint,15
Pointing to Goneril,15
I bar it in the interest of my wife:,15
And I her husband contradict your bans.,15
My lady is bespoke.,15
Thou art arm'd Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:,15
Thy heinous manifest and many treasons,15
Throwing down a glove,15
Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less,15
Sick O sick!,15
There's my exchange:,15
what in the world he is,15
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,15
My truth and honour firmly.,15
A herald ho a herald!,15
All levied in my name have in my name,15
My sickness grows upon me.,15
Exit Regan led,15
Come hither herald--Let the trumpet sound,15
Sound trumpet!,15
[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within,15
supposed Earl of Gloucester that he is a manifold,15
trumpet: he is bold in his defence.',15
First trumpet,15
Second trumpet,15
Third trumpet,15
Enter EDGAR at the third sound armed with a trumpet before him,15
Upon this call o' the trumpet.,15
Your name your quality? and why you answer,15
Know my name is lost;,15
Yet am I noble as the adversary,15
Which is that adversary?,15
Himself: what say'st thou to him?,15
That if my speech offend a noble heart,15
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours,15
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence,15
Thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor;,15
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;,15
To the descent and dust below thy foot,15
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent,15
Thou liest.,15
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,15
What safe and nicely I might well delay,15
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;,15
Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,15
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets speak!,15
Save him save him!,15
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer,15
But cozen'd and beguiled.,15
Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold sir:,15
No tearing lady: I perceive you know it.,15
Say if I do the laws are mine not thine:,15
Most monstrous! oh!,15
Ask me not what I know.,15
Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.,15
And more much more; the time will bring it out:,15
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,15
Let's exchange charity.,15
If more the more thou hast wrong'd me.,15
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices,15
The dark and vicious place where thee he got,15
Thou hast spoken right 'tis true;,15
Methought thy very gait did prophesy,15
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I,15
Worthy prince I know't.,15
How have you known the miseries of your father?,15
And when 'tis told O that my heart would burst!,15
That follow'd me so near--O our lives' sweetness!,15
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift,15
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit,15
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,15
Never--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,15
Not sure though hoping of this good success,15
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,15
Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief,15
This speech of yours hath moved me,15
You look as you had something more to say.,15
For I am almost ready to dissolve,15
This would have seem'd a period,15
To amplify too much would make much more,15
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,15
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then finding,15
He fastened on my neck and bellow'd out,15
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him,15
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life,15
And there I left him tranced.,15
Kent sir the banish'd Kent; who in disguise,15
Improper for a slave.,15
Help help O help!,15
Speak man.,15
Tis hot it smokes;,15
Who dead? speak man.,15
By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.,15
Now marry in an instant.,15
Produce their bodies be they alive or dead:,15
Touches us not with pity.,15
Enter KENT,15
The time will not allow the compliment,15
I am come,15
Is he not here?,15
Speak Edmund where's the king? and where's Cordelia?,15
The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in,15
Yet Edmund was beloved:,15
And after slew herself.,15
I pant for life: some good I mean to do,15
Be brief in it to the castle; for my writ,15
Nay send in time.,15
To who my lord? Who hath the office? send,15
Well thought on: take my sword,15
Haste thee for thy life.,15
He hath commission from thy wife and me,15
To lay the blame upon her own despair,15
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.,15
Re-enter KING LEAR with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR Captain and others following,15
Had I your tongues and eyes I'ld use them so,15
I know when one is dead and when one lives;,15
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,15
Is this the promised end,15
Fall and cease!,15
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows,15
[Kneeling]  O my good master!,15
Tis noble Kent your friend.,15
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!,15
What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,15
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.,15
Did I not fellow?,15
I would have made them skip: I am old now,15
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.,15
One of them we behold.,15
The same,15
He's a good fellow I can tell you that;,15
No my good lord; I am the very man--,15
That from your first of difference and decay,15
You are welcome hither.,15
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,15
Ay so I think.,15
That we present us to him.,15
Enter a Captain,15
That's but a trifle here.,15
What comfort to this great decay may come,15
During the life of this old majesty,15
To EDGAR and KENT,15
With boot and such addition as your honours,15
The wages of their virtue and all foes,15
And my poor fool is hang'd! No no no life!,15
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,15
Pray you undo this button: thank you sir.,15
Look there look there!,15
He faints! My lord my lord!,15
Look up my lord.,15
That would upon the rack of this tough world,15
He is gone indeed.,15
He but usurp'd his life.,15
Is general woe.,15
Friends of my soul you twain,15
I have a journey sir shortly to go;,15
The weight of this sad time we must obey;,15
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,15
Exeunt with a dead march,15
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.,16
Let fame that all hunt after in their lives,16
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;,16
The endeavor of this present breath may buy,16
And make us heirs of all eternity.,16
That war against your own affections,16
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:,16
Our court shall be a little Academe,16
You three Biron Dumain and Longaville,16
My fellow-scholars and to keep those statutes,16
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,16
That violates the smallest branch herein:,16
Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too.,16
The mind shall banquet though the body pine:,16
Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits.,16
The grosser manner of these world's delights,16
To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die;,16
I can but say their protestation over;,16
That is to live and study here three years.,16
As not to see a woman in that term,16
And one day in a week to touch no food,16
The which I hope is not enrolled there;,16
And not be seen to wink of all the day--,16
And make a dark night too of half the day--,16
O these are barren tasks too hard to keep,16
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.,16
I only swore to study with your grace,16
You swore to that Biron and to the rest.,16
What is the end of study? let me know.,16
Things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense?,16
Come on then; I will swear to study so,16
As thus--to study where I well may dine,16
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,16
Or having sworn too hard a keeping oath,16
If study's gain be thus and this be so,16
Swear me to this and I will ne'er say no.,16
And train our intellects to vain delight.,16
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:,16
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while,16
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:,16
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.,16
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,16
And give him light that it was blinded by.,16
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:,16
Save base authority from others' books,16
That give a name to every fixed star,16
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.,16
And every godfather can give a name.,16
Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding!,16
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.,16
Fit in his place and time.,16
Something then in rhyme.,16
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.,16
Before the birds have any cause to sing?,16
At Christmas I no more desire a rose,16
But like of each thing that in season grows.,16
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.,16
No my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:,16
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,16
And bide the penance of each three years' day.,16
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.,16
[Reads]  'Item That no woman shall come within a,16
Four days ago.,16
Reads,16
Marry that did I.,16
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.,16
Reads,16
within the term of three years he shall endure such,16
This article my liege yourself must break;,16
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--,16
About surrender up of Aquitaine,16
Therefore this article is made in vain,16
What say you lords? Why this was quite forgot.,16
While it doth study to have what it would,16
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,16
We must of force dispense with this decree;,16
Necessity will make us all forsworn,16
For every man with his affects is born,16
If I break faith this word shall speak for me;,16
So to the laws at large I write my name:,16
And he that breaks them in the least degree,16
Suggestions are to other as to me;,16
I am the last that will last keep his oath.,16
Ay that there is. Our court you know is haunted,16
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,16
One whom the music of his own vain tongue,16
A man of complements whom right and wrong,16
This child of fancy that Armado hight,16
In high-born words the worth of many a knight,16
How you delight my lords I know not I;,16
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.,16
A man of fire-new words fashion's own knight.,16
And so to study three years is but short.,16
Which is the duke's own person?,16
I myself reprehend his own person for I am his,16
in flesh and blood.,16
Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany,16
Sir the contempts thereof are as touching me.,16
How low soever the matter I hope in God for high words.,16
To hear? or forbear laughing?,16
forbear both.,16
climb in the merriness.,16
The manner of it is I was taken with the manner.,16
In manner and form following sir; all those three:,16
her upon the form and taken following her into the,16
following. Now sir for the manner--it is the,16
in some form.,16
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend,16
Will you hear this letter with attention?,16
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.,16
sole dominator of Navarre my soul's earth's god,16
Not a word of Costard yet.,16
It may be so: but if he say it is so he is in,16
Peace!,16
No words!,16
[Reads]  'So it is besieged with sable-coloured,16
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving,16
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when,16
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much,16
I mean I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then,16
that obscene and preposterous event that draweth,16
here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest;,16
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-,16
swain that base minnow of thy mirth'--,16
[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul'--,16
[Reads]  'that shallow vassal'--,16
[Reads]  'which as I remember hight Costard'--,16
[Reads]  'sorted and consorted contrary to thy,16
which with--O with--but with this I passion to say,16
With a wench.,16
female; or for thy more sweet understanding a,16

Dull; a man of good repute carriage bearing and,16
Me an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.,16
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid,16
and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring,16
and heart-burning heat of duty.,16
This is not so well as I looked for but the best,16
Ay the best for the worst. But sirrah what say,16
Sir I confess the wench.,16
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of,16
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken,16
I was taken with none sir: I was taken with a damsel.,16
This was no damsel neither sir; she was a virgin.,16
If it were I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.,16
This maid will serve my turn sir.,16
a week with bran and water.,16
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.,16
And go we lords to put in practise that,16
Exeunt FERDINAND LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN,16
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.,16
I suffer for the truth sir; for true it is I was,16
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of,16
till then sit thee down sorrow!,16
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST,16
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH,16
Boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit,16
A great sign sir that he will look sad.,16
Why sadness is one and the self-same thing dear imp.,16
DON,16
tender juvenal?,16
DON,16
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?,16
I spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton,16
nominate tender.,16
old time which we may name tough.,16
Pretty and apt.,16
I apt and my saying pretty?,16
Thou pretty because little.,16
DON,16
Speak you this in my praise master?,16
In thy condign praise.,16
DON,16
That an eel is quick.,16
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.,16
DON,16
[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.,16
I have promised to study three years with the duke.,16
DON,16
How many is one thrice told?,16
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.,16
DON,16
complete man.,16
deuce-ace amounts to.,16
It doth amount to one more than two.,16
DON,16
Why sir is this such a piece of study? Now here,16
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three' and,16
will tell you.,16
A most fine figure!,16

ACT II,16
Enter the PRINCESS of France ROSALINE MARIA KATHARINE BOYET Lords and other Attendants,16
Consider who the king your father sends,16
Yourself held precious in the world's esteem,16
Of all perfections that a man may owe,16
Than Aquitaine a dowry for a queen.,16
As Nature was in making graces dear,16
And prodigally gave them all to you.,16
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:,16
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:,16
Than you much willing to be counted wise,16
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,16
Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,16
No woman may approach his silent court:,16
Before we enter his forbidden gates,16
Bold of your worthiness we single you,16
Tell him the daughter of the King of France,16
Importunes personal conference with his grace:,16
Like humble-visaged suitors his high will.,16
All pride is willing pride and yours is so.,16
Who are the votaries my loving lords,16
Lord Longaville is one.,16
I know him madam: at a marriage-feast,16
Of Jaques Falconbridge solemnized,16
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;,16
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.,16
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,16
Whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills,16
Some merry mocking lord belike; is't so?,16
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.,16
The young Dumain a well-accomplished youth,16
Most power to do most harm least knowing ill;,16
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.,16
And much too little of that good I saw,16
Another of these students at that time,16
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,16
I never spent an hour's talk withal:,16
For every object that the one doth catch,16
Which his fair tongue conceit's expositor,16
That aged ears play truant at his tales,16
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.,16
That every one her own hath garnished,16
Here comes Boyet.,16
Now what admittance lord?,16
And he and his competitors in oath,16
Before I came. Marry thus much I have learnt:,16
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,16
To let you enter his unpeopled house.,16
Enter FERDINAND LONGAVILLE DUMAIN BIRON and Attendants,16
Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have,16
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.,16
I will be welcome then: conduct me thither.,16
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.,16
Why will shall break it; will and nothing else.,16
Were my lord so his ignorance were wise,16
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:,16
And sin to break it.,16
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.,16
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.,16
You will the sooner that I were away;,16
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?,16
I know you did.,16
You must not be so quick.,16
Your wit's too hot it speeds too fast 'twill tire.,16
What time o' day?,16
Now fair befall your mask!,16
And send you many lovers!,16
Nay then will I be gone.,16
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;,16
Disbursed by my father in his wars.,16
Received that sum yet there remains unpaid,16
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,16
If then the king your father will restore,16
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,16
But that it seems he little purposeth,16
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,16
To have his title live in Aquitaine;,16
And have the money by our father lent,16
Dear Princess were not his requests so far,16
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,16
You do the king my father too much wrong,16
In so unseeming to confess receipt,16
I do protest I never heard of it;,16
Or yield up Aquitaine.,16
Boyet you can produce acquittances,16
Of Charles his father.,16
So please your grace the packet is not come,16
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.,16
All liberal reason I will yield unto.,16
As honour without breach of honour may,16
You may not come fair princess in my gates;,16
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,16
Your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell:,16
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!,16

Pray you do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.,16

Good sir be not offended.,16

Not unlike sir that may be.,16
What's her name in the cap?,16
Is she wedded or no?,16
You are welcome sir: adieu.,16
Exit BIRON,16
Not a word with him but a jest.,16
It was well done of you to take him at his word.,16
Two hot sheeps marry.,16
No sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips.,16
So you grant pasture for me.,16
Not so gentle beast:,16
Belonging to whom?,16
Good wits will be jangling; but gentles agree:,16
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.,16
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,16
With what?,16
Your reason?,16
To the court of his eye peeping thorough desire:,16
Proud with his form in his eye pride express'd:,16
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;,16
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:,16
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;,16
Did point you to buy them along as you pass'd:,16
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.,16
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.,16
But to speak that in words which his eye hath,16
I only have made a mouth of his eye,16
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.,16
Then was Venus like her mother for her father is but grim.,16
No.,16
Ay our way to be gone.,16

I am all these three.,16

Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.,16

Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy and,16

I will example it:,16
Were still at odds being but three.,16
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.,16

Then call'd you for the l'envoy.,16

And he ended the market.,16
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?,16
Thou hast no feeling of it Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:,16

And such barren plants are set before us that we,16
Which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that,16
For as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool,16
But omne bene say I; being of an old father's mind,16
You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit,16

What is Dictynna?,16
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,16

Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.,16

proved wit! By the Lord this love is as mad as,16
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if,16
eye--by this light but for her eye I would not,16

sonnets already: the clown bore it the fool sent,16
fool sweetest lady! By the world I would not care,16

Enter FERDINAND with a paper,16
[Aside]  Shot by heaven! Proceed sweet Cupid:,16
left pap. In faith secrets!,16
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not,16
As thy eye-beams when their fresh rays have smote,16
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright,16
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;,16
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;,16
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,16
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep,16
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,16
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:,16
Steps aside,16
Now in thy likeness one more fool appear!,16
Ay me I am forsworn!,16
In love I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!,16
Am I the first that have been perjured so?,16
Thou makest the triumviry the corner-cap of society,16
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:,16
These numbers will I tear and write in prose.,16
Disfigure not his slop.,16
Reads,16
Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,16
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.,16
Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee:,16
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.,16
Then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine,16
If broken then it is no fault of mine:,16
To lose an oath to win a paradise?,16
A green goose a goddess: pure pure idolatry.,16
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.,16
All hid all hid; an old infant play.,16
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.,16
Enter DUMAIN with a paper,16
O most divine Kate!,16
By heaven the wonder in a mortal eye!,16
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.,16
As upright as the cedar.,16
Her shoulder is with child.,16
Ay as some days; but then no sun must shine.,16
And I had mine!,16
Amen so I had mine: is not that a good word?,16
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.,16
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!,16
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.,16
On a day--alack the day!--,16
Spied a blossom passing fair,16
Through the velvet leaves the wind,16
That the lover sick to death,16
Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow;,16
But alack my hand is sworn,16
Vow alack for youth unmeet,16
Do not call it sin in me,16
Thou for whom Jove would swear,16
And deny himself for Jove,16
This will I send and something else more plain,16
O would the king Biron and Longaville,16
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;,16
[Advancing]  Dumain thy love is far from charity.,16
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.,16
You chide at him offending twice as much;,16
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,16
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.,16
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:,16
Saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion:,16
One her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes:,16
You would for paradise break faith and troth;,16
And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.,16
Faith so infringed which such zeal did swear?,16
How will he triumph leap and laugh at it!,16
I would not have him know so much by me.,16
Advancing,16
Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove,16
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears,16
You'll not be perjured 'tis a hateful thing;,16
But are you not ashamed? nay are you not,16
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;,16
O what a scene of foolery have I seen,16
O me with what strict patience have I sat,16
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,16
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,16
Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumain?,16
And where my liege's? all about the breast:,16
Too bitter is thy jest.,16
Not you to me but I betray'd by you:,16
To break the vow I am engaged in;,16
With men like men of inconstancy.,16
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time,16
Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye,16
A leg a limb?,16
A true man or a thief that gallops so?,16
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD,16
What present hast thou there?,16
What makes treason here?,16
If it mar nothing neither,16
I beseech your grace let this letter be read:,16
Biron read it over.,16
Where hadst thou it?,16
Where hadst thou it?,16
BIRON tears the letter,16
A toy my liege a toy: your grace needs not fear it.,16
It is Biron's writing and here is his name.,16
[To COSTARD]  Ah you whoreson loggerhead! you were,16
Guilty my lord guilty! I confess I confess.,16
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:,16
Are pick-purses in love and we deserve to die.,16
Now the number is even.,16
Will these turtles be gone?,16
Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay.,16
Sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace!,16
The sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face;,16
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;,16
What did these rent lines show some love of thine?,16
That like a rude and savage man of Inde,16
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind,16
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye,16
That is not blinded by her majesty?,16
My love her mistress is a gracious moon;,16
My eyes are then no eyes nor I Biron:,16
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty,16
Where several worthies make one dignity,16
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues--,16
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,16
A wither'd hermit five-score winters worn,16
Beauty doth varnish age as if new-born,16
O 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.,16
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!,16
O who can give an oath? where is a book?,16
If that she learn not of her eye to look:,16
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,16
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.,16
O if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,16
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;,16
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,16
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise,16
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.,16
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.,16
Your mistresses dare never come in rain,16
Twere good yours did; for sir to tell you plain,16
I'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here.,16
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.,16
O if the streets were paved with thine eyes,16
O vile! then as she goes what upward lies,16
But what of this? are we not all in love?,16
Then leave this chat; and good Biron now prove,16
Ay marry there; some flattery for this evil.,16
Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil.,16
Tis more than need.,16
Consider what you first did swear unto,16
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.,16
And abstinence engenders maladies.,16
In that each of you have forsworn his book,16
For when would you my lord or you or you,16
Without the beauty of a woman's face?,16
Why universal plodding poisons up,16
As motion and long-during action tires,16
Now for not looking on a woman's face,16
And study too the causer of your vow;,16
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?,16
And where we are our learning likewise is:,16
Do we not likewise see our learning there?,16
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.,16
In leaden contemplation have found out,16
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?,16
And therefore finding barren practisers,16
But love first learned in a lady's eyes,16
But with the motion of all elements,16
And gives to every power a double power,16
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;,16
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,16
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible,16
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:,16
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?,16
As bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair:,16
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.,16
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;,16
And plant in tyrants mild humility.,16
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;,16
That show contain and nourish all the world:,16
Then fools you were these women to forswear,16
For wisdom's sake a word that all men love,16
Or for men's sake the authors of these women,16
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,16
It is religion to be thus forsworn,16
And who can sever love from charity?,16
Advance your standards and upon them lords;,16
In conflict that you get the sun of them.,16
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?,16
Some entertainment for them in their tents.,16
Then homeward every man attach the hand,16
We will with some strange pastime solace them,16
For revels dances masks and merry hours,16
Away away! no time shall be omitted,16
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;,16
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;,16
Exeunt,16

Enter HOLOFERNES SIR NATHANIEL and DULL,16
I praise God for you sir: your reasons at dinner,16

Exeunt,16
SCENE II. The same.,16
Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart,16
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!,16
Madame came nothing else along with that?,16
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,16
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.,16
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.,16
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.,16
And so she died: had she been light like you,16
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:,16
What's your dark meaning mouse of this light word?,16
We need more light to find your meaning out.,16
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.,16
So do not you for you are a light wench.,16
You weigh me not? O that's you care not for me.,16
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.,16
Who sent it? and what is it?,16
An if my face were but as fair as yours,16
Nay I have verses too I thank Biron:,16
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:,16
O he hath drawn my picture in his letter!,16
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.,16
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.,16
My red dominical my golden letter:,16
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.,16
Madam this glove.,16
Yes madam and moreover,16
A huge translation of hypocrisy,16
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:,16
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart,16
Ay or I would these hands might never part.,16
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.,16
O that I knew he were but in by the week!,16
And wait the season and observe the times,16
And shape his service wholly to my hests,16
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state,16
None are so surely caught when they are catch'd,16
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school,16
The blood of youth burns not with such excess,16
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note,16
Since all the power thereof it doth apply,16
Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face.,16
O I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?,16
Prepare madam prepare!,16
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,16
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;,16
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they,16
Under the cool shade of a sycamore,16
When lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,16
The king and his companions: warily,16
And overheard what you shall overhear,16
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,16
Action and accent did they teach him there;,16
And ever and anon they made a doubt,16
For' quoth the king 'an angel shalt thou see;,16
The boy replied 'An angel is not evil;,16
With that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,16
One rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore,16
Another with his finger and his thumb,16
The third he caper'd and cried 'All goes well;',16
With that they all did tumble on the ground,16
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,16
But what but what come they to visit us?,16
Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess.,16
And every one his love-feat will advance,16
By favours several which they did bestow.,16
For ladies we shall every one be mask'd;,16
Despite of suit to see a lady's face.,16
And then the king will court thee for his dear;,16
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.,16
Woo contrary deceived by these removes.,16
But in this changing what is your intent?,16
They do it but in mocking merriment;,16
Their several counsels they unbosom shall,16
Upon the next occasion that we meet,16
But shall we dance if they desire to't?,16
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,16
Why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,16
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt,16
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,16
So shall we stay mocking intended game,16
Trumpets sound within,16
The Ladies mask,16
All hail the richest beauties on the earth!--,16
A holy parcel of the fairest dames.,16
That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!,16
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--,16
Out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe,16
[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold rogue.,16
--with your sun-beamed eyes--,16
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.',16
Is this your perfectness? be gone you rogue!,16
What would these strangers? know their minds Boyet:,16
That some plain man recount their purposes,16
What would you with the princess?,16
What would they say they?,16
Why that they have; and bid them so be gone.,16
Say to her we have measured many miles,16
They say that they have measured many a mile,16
It is not so. Ask them how many inches,16
The measure then of one is easily told.,16
And many miles the princess bids you tell,16
Tell her we measure them by weary steps.,16
How many weary steps,16
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?,16
Our duty is so rich so infinite,16
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,16
My face is but a moon and clouded too.,16
Vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine,16
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;,16
Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.,16
Play music then! Nay you must do it soon.,16
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.,16
You took the moon at full but now she's changed.,16
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.,16
But your legs should do it.,16
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.,16
Only to part friends:,16
More measure of this measure; be not nice.,16
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?,16
That can never be.,16
Twice to your visor and half once to you.,16
In private then.,16
They converse apart,16
Honey and milk and sugar; there is three.,16
Metheglin wort and malmsey: well run dice!,16
Seventh sweet adieu:,16
One word in secret.,16
Thou grievest my gall.,16
Therefore meet.,16
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?,16
Fair lady--,16
Take that for your fair lady.,16
As much in private and I'll bid adieu.,16
What was your vizard made without a tongue?,16
O for your reason! quickly sir; I long.,16
And would afford my speechless vizard half.,16
A calf fair lady!,16
Let's part the word.,16
Take all and wean it; it may prove an ox.,16
Will you give horns chaste lady? do not so.,16
One word in private with you ere I die.,16
They converse apart,16
As is the razor's edge invisible,16
Above the sense of sense; so sensible,16
Fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things.,16
By heaven all dry-beaten with pure scoff!,16
Twenty adieus my frozen Muscovits.,16
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?,16
Well-liking wits they have; gross gross; fat fat.,16
Will they not think you hang themselves tonight?,16
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.,16
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.,16
Dumain was at my service and his sword:,16
Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;,16
Qualm perhaps.,16
Go sickness as thou art!,16
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.,16
And Longaville was for my service born.,16
Madam and pretty mistresses give ear:,16
In their own shapes; for it can never be,16
Will they return?,16
And leap for joy though they are lame with blows:,16
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.,16
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;,16
Are angels vailing clouds or roses blown.,16
If they return in their own shapes to woo?,16
Let's mock them still as well known as disguised:,16
Disguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear;,16
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd,16
Should be presented at our tent to us.,16
Whip to our tents as roes run o'er land.,16
Re-enter FERDINAND BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN in their proper habits,16
Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty,16
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.,16
Exit,16
And utters it again when God doth please:,16
At wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs;,16
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.,16
Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve;,16
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;,16
That when he plays at tables chides the dice,16
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,16
The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet:,16
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;,16
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.,16
That put Armado's page out of his part!,16
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?,16
All hail sweet madam and fair time of day!,16
Construe my speeches better if you may.,16
We came to visit you and purpose now,16
This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:,16
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:,16
You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;,16
Now by my maiden honour yet as pure,16
A world of torments though I should endure,16
So much I hate a breaking cause to be,16
O you have lived in desolation here,16
Not so my lord; it is not so I swear;,16
A mess of Russians left us but of late.,16
Ay in truth my lord;,16
Madam speak true. It is not so my lord:,16
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.,16
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,16
They did not bless us with one happy word.,16
When they are thirsty fools would fain have drink.,16
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,16
By light we lose light: your capacity,16
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.,16
I am a fool and full of poverty.,16
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.,16
All the fool mine?,16
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?,16
There then that vizard; that superfluous case,16
We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.,16
Amazed my lord? why looks your highness sad?,16
Sea-sick I think coming from Muscovy.,16
Can any face of brass hold longer out?,16
Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout;,16
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;,16
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.,16
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,16
Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song!,16
Three-piled hyperboles spruce affectation,16
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:,16
By this white glove;--how white the hand God knows!--,16
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:,16
My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw.,16
Yet I have a trick,16
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft let us see:,16
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;,16
These lords are visited; you are not free,16
No they are free that gave these tokens to us.,16
It is not so; for how can this be true,16
Peace! for I will not have to do with you.,16
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.,16
Some fair excuse.,16
Were not you here but even now disguised?,16
And were you well advised?,16
When you then were here,16
That more than all the world I did respect her.,16
Upon mine honour no.,16
Your oath once broke you force not to forswear.,16
I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,16
Madam he swore that he did hold me dear,16
Above this world; adding thereto moreover,16
God give thee joy of him! the noble lord,16
What mean you madam? by my life my troth,16
By heaven you did; and to confirm it plain,16
My faith and this the princess I did give:,16
Pardon me sir this jewel did she wear;,16
What will you have me or your pearl again?,16
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,16
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:,16
Some mumble-news some trencher-knight some Dick,16
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,16
The ladies did change favours: and then we,16
Now to our perjury to add more terror,16
Much upon this it is: and might not you,16
Forestall our sport to make us thus untrue?,16
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?,16
Holding a trencher jesting merrily?,16
Die when you will a smock shall be your shroud.,16
Wounds like a leaden sword.,16
Hath this brave manage this career been run.,16
Enter COSTARD,16
O Lord sir they would know,16
What are there but three?,16
For every one pursents three.,16
Not so sir; under correction sir; I hope it is not so.,16
what we know:,16
Is not nine.,16
By Jove I always took three threes for nine.,16
by reckoning sir.,16
O Lord sir the parties themselves the actors,16
own part I am as they say but to parfect one man,16
Art thou one of the Worthies?,16
Great: for mine own part I know not the degree of,16
Go bid them prepare.,16
some care.,16
Biron they will shame us: let them not approach.,16
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.,16
Nay my good lord let me o'errule you now:,16
Where zeal strives to content and the contents,16
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,16
A right description of our sport my lord.,16
DON,16
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.,16
Doth this man serve God?,16
He speaks not like a man of God's making.,16
That is all one my fair sweet honey monarch; for,16
fantastical; too too vain too too vain: but we,16
I wish you the peace of mind most royal couplement!,16
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He,16
Great; the parish curate Alexander; Armado's page,16
these four Worthies in their first show thrive,16
There is five in the first show.,16
The pedant the braggart the hedge-priest the fool,16
Abate throw at novum and the whole world again,16
The ship is under sail and here she comes amain.,16
I Pompey am--,16
I Pompey am--,16
Well said old mocker: I must needs be friends,16
I Pompey am Pompey surnamed the Big--,16
It is 'Great' sir:--,16
That oft in field with targe and shield did make,16
And travelling along this coast I here am come by chance,16
If your ladyship would say 'Thanks Pompey' I had done.,16
Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I,16
My hat to a halfpenny Pompey proves the best Worthy.,16
When in the world I lived I was the world's,16
By east west north and south I spread my,16
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander--,16
Your nose smells 'no' in this most tender-smelling knight.,16
When in the world I lived I was the world's,16
Most true 'tis right; you were so Alisander.,16
Your servant and Costard.,16
[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O sir you have overthrown,16
the painted cloth for this: your lion that holds,16
to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,16
SIR NATHANIEL retires,16
honest man look you and soon dashed. He is a,16
bowler: but for Alisander--alas you see how,16
a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.,16
Great Hercules is presented by this imp,16
And when he was a babe a child a shrimp,16
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,16
Keep some state in thy exit and vanish.,16
Judas I am--,16
Not Iscariot sir.,16
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.,16
Judas I am--,16
What mean you sir?,16
Begin sir; you are my elder.,16
I will not be put out of countenance.,16
What is this?,16
The head of a bodkin.,16
The face of an old Roman coin scarce seen.,16
The carved-bone face on a flask.,16
Ay and in a brooch of lead.,16
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.,16
False; we have given thee faces.,16
An thou wert a lion we would do so.,16
And so adieu sweet Jude! nay why dost thou stay?,16
For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as away!,16
A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark he may stumble.,16
Alas poor Maccabaeus how hath he been baited!,16
Hide thy head Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.,16
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.,16
I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.,16
More calf certain.,16
This cannot be Hector.,16
DON,16
Gave Hector a gift--,16
A lemon.,16
No cloven.,16
Peace!--,16
Gave Hector a gift the heir of Ilion;,16
From morn till night out of his pavilion.,16
That mint.,16
DON,16
I must rather give it the rein for it runs against Hector.,16
DON,16
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,16
To the PRINCESS,16
Speak brave Hector: we are much delighted.,16
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.,16
[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.,16
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal--,16
is two months on her way.,16
What meanest thou?,16
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in,16
DON,16
die.,16
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by,16
Most rare Pompey!,16
Greater than great great great great Pompey!,16
Hector trembles.,16
on! stir them on!,16
Ay if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will,16
DON,16
I will not fight with a pole like a northern man:,16
let me borrow my arms again.,16
I'll do it in my shirt.,16
Master let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you,16
you? You will lose your reputation.,16
Gentlemen and soldiers pardon me; I will not combat,16
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.,16
Sweet bloods I both may and will.,16
DON,16
woolward for penance.,16
linen: since when I'll be sworn he wore none but,16
his heart for a favour.,16
God save you madam!,16
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.,16
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--,16
Even so; my tale is told.,16
DON,16
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of,16
Exeunt Worthies,16
Boyet prepare; I will away tonight.,16
Prepare I say. I thank you gracious lords,16
Out of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafe,16
The liberal opposition of our spirits,16
In the converse of breath: your gentleness,16
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:,16
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.,16
All causes to the purpose of his speed,16
That which long process could not arbitrate:,16
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love,16
Yet since love's argument was first on foot,16
From what it purposed; since to wail friends lost,16
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.,16
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;,16
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,16
Hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours,16
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous--,16
All wanton as a child skipping and vain,16
Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms,16
To every varied object in his glance:,16
Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes,16
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults,16
Our love being yours the error that love makes,16
By being once false for ever to be true,16
And even that falsehood in itself a sin,16
We have received your letters full of love;,16
And in our maiden council rated them,16
As bombast and as lining to the time:,16
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves,16
Our letters madam show'd much more than jest.,16
We did not quote them so.,16
Grant us your loves.,16
To make a world-without-end bargain in.,16
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:,16
You will do aught this shall you do for me:,16
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,16
There stay until the twelve celestial signs,16
If this austere insociable life,16
If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds,16
But that it bear this trial and last love;,16
Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts,16
I will be thine; and till that instant shut,16
Raining the tears of lamentation,16
If this thou do deny let our hands part,16
If this or more than this I would deny,16
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!,16
But what to me my love? but what to me? A wife?,16
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.,16
Not so my lord; a twelvemonth and a day,16
Come when the king doth to my lady come;,16
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.,16
What says Maria?,16
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.,16
The liker you; few taller are so young.,16
Behold the window of my heart mine eye,16
Impose some service on me for thy love.,16
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue,16
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,16
That lie within the mercy of your wit.,16
And therewithal to win me if you please,16
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day,16
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,16
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.,16
It cannot be; it is impossible:,16
Why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,16
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:,16
Of him that hears it never in the tongue,16
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,16
And I will have you and that fault withal;,16
And I shall find you empty of that fault,16
A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,16
[To FERDINAND]  Ay sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.,16
Our wooing doth not end like an old play;,16
Might well have made our sport a comedy.,16
And then 'twill end.,16
Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO,16
Sweet majesty vouchsafe me--,16
The worthy knight of Troy.,16
I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave. I am,16
plough for her sweet love three years. But most,16
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the,16
end of our show.,16

THE SONG,16
When daisies pied and violets blue,16
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,16
The cuckoo then on every tree,16
Cuckoo cuckoo: O word of fear,16
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,16
When turtles tread and rooks and daws,16
The cuckoo then on every tree,16
Cuckoo cuckoo: O word of fear,16
WINTER.,16
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,16
And milk comes frozen home in pail,16
Then nightly sings the staring owl  Tu-whit;,16
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.,16
And coughing drowns the parson's saw,16
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,16
Then nightly sings the staring owl  Tu-whit;,16
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.,16
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of,16
Exeunt,16
SCENE I. A desert place.,17
When shall we three meet again,17
When the hurlyburly's done,17
That will be ere the set of sun.,17
Upon the heath.,17
I come Graymalkin!,17
Anon.,17
Hover through the fog and filthy air.,17
SCENE II. A camp near Forres.,17
What bloody man is that? He can report,17
The newest state.,17
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought,17
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil,17
Doubtful it stood;,17
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--,17
The multiplying villanies of nature,17
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;,17
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:,17
Disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel,17
Like valour's minion carved out his passage,17
Which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him,17
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.,17
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection,17
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come,17
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd,17
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,17
Began a fresh assault.,17
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo?,17
As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion.,17
As cannons overcharged with double cracks so they,17
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,17
I cannot tell.,17
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;,17
Exit Sergeant attended,17
Enter ROSS,17
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look,17
God save the king!,17
From Fife great king;,17
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,17
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,17
Till that Bellona's bridegroom lapp'd in proof,17
Point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm.,17
The victory fell on us.,17
That now,17
Nor would we deign him burial of his men,17
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.,17
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,17
I'll see it done.,17
Exeunt,17
Thunder. Enter the three Witches,17
Killing swine.,17
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,17
Give me' quoth I:,17
Her husband's to Aleppo gone master o' the Tiger:,17
And like a rat without a tail,17
I'll give thee a wind.,17
And I another.,17
And the very ports they blow,17
I' the shipman's card.,17
Sleep shall neither night nor day,17
He shall live a man forbid:,17
Shall he dwindle peak and pine:,17
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.,17
Show me show me.,17
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.,17
A drum a drum!,17
The weird sisters hand in hand,17
Thus do go about about:,17
And thrice again to make up nine.,17
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO,17
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these,17
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,17
That man may question? You seem to understand me,17
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,17
That you are so.,17
All hail Macbeth! hail to thee thane of Glamis!,17
All hail Macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter!,17
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,17
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner,17
Of noble having and of royal hope,17
If you can look into the seeds of time,17
Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear,17
Hail!,17
Hail!,17
Not so happy yet much happier.,17
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo!,17
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more:,17
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,17
Stands not within the prospect of belief,17
You owe this strange intelligence? or why,17
With such prophetic greeting? Speak I charge you.,17
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,17
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted,17
Were such things here as we do speak about?,17
That takes the reason prisoner?,17
You shall be king.,17
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?,17
The king hath happily received Macbeth,17
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,17
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,17
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,17
Strange images of death. As thick as hail,17
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,17
We are sent,17
Only to herald thee into his sight,17
And for an earnest of a greater honour,17
In which addition hail most worthy thane!,17
What can the devil speak true?,17
In borrow'd robes?,17
But under heavy judgment bears that life,17
With those of Norway or did line the rebel,17
He labour'd in his country's wreck I know not;,17
Have overthrown him.,17
The greatest is behind.,17
Thanks for your pains.,17
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,17
Promised no less to them?,17
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,17
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,17
Win us with honest trifles to betray's,17
Cousins a word I pray you.,17
As happy prologues to the swelling act,17
Aside,17
Why hath it given me earnest of success,17
If good why do I yield to that suggestion,17
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,17
Are less than horrible imaginings:,17
Shakes so my single state of man that function,17
But what is not.,17
[Aside]  If chance will have me king why chance may crown me,17
New horrors come upon him,17
But with the aid of use.,17
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.,17
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought,17
Are register'd where every day I turn,17
Think upon what hath chanced and at more time,17
Our free hearts each to other.,17
Till then enough. Come friends.,17
SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.,17
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not,17
My liege,17
With one that saw him die: who did report,17
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth,17
Became him like the leaving it; he died,17
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,17
There's no art,17
He was a gentleman on whom I built,17
Enter MACBETH BANQUO ROSS and ANGUS,17
The sin of my ingratitude even now,17
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow,17
That the proportion both of thanks and payment,17
More is thy due than more than all can pay.,17
In doing it pays itself. Your highness' part,17
Are to your throne and state children and servants,17
Safe toward your love and honour.,17
I have begun to plant thee and will labour,17
That hast no less deserved nor must be known,17
And hold thee to my heart.,17
The harvest is your own.,17
Wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves,17
And you whose places are the nearest know,17
Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter,17
Not unaccompanied invest him only,17
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,17
The rest is labour which is not used for you:,17
The hearing of my wife with your approach;,17
My worthy Cawdor!,17
On which I must fall down or else o'erleap,17
Let not light see my black and deep desires:,17
Which the eye fears when it is done to see.,17
True worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,17
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,17
It is a peerless kinsman.,17
SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.,17
They met me in the day of success: and I have,17
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire,17
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in,17
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,17
me to the coming on of time with 'Hail king that,17
thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou,17
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it,17
Glamis thou art and Cawdor; and shalt be,17
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness,17
Art not without ambition but without,17
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,17
That which cries 'Thus thou must do if thou have it;,17
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,17
And chastise with the valour of my tongue,17
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem,17
Enter a Messenger,17
The king comes here to-night.,17
Is not thy master with him? who were't so,17
So please you it is true: our thane is coming:,17
Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more,17
Give him tending;,17
Exit Messenger,17
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan,17
That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here,17
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;,17
That no compunctious visitings of nature,17
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,17
Wherever in your sightless substances,17
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,17
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,17
Enter MACBETH,17
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter!,17
This ignorant present and I feel now,17
My dearest love,17
And when goes hence?,17
O never,17
Your face my thane is as a book where men,17
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,17
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming,17
This night's great business into my dispatch;,17
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.,17
Only look up clear;,17
Leave all the rest to me.,17
SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.,17
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air,17
Unto our gentle senses.,17
The temple-haunting martlet does approve,17
Smells wooingly here: no jutty frieze,17
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:,17
The air is delicate.,17
See see our honour'd hostess!,17
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you,17
And thank us for your trouble.,17
In every point twice done and then done double,17
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith,17
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,17
Where's the thane of Cawdor?,17
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;,17
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,17
Your servants ever,17
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,17
Give me your hand;,17
And shall continue our graces towards him.,17
Exeunt,17
Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer and divers  Servants with dishes and service and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH,17
It were done quickly: if the assassination,17
With his surcease success; that but this blow,17
But here upon this bank and shoal of time,17
We still have judgment here; that we but teach,17
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice,17
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;,17
Strong both against the deed; then as his host,17
Not bear the knife myself. Besides this Duncan,17
So clear in his great office that his virtues,17
The deep damnation of his taking-off;,17
Striding the blast or heaven's cherubim horsed,17
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,17
To prick the sides of my intent but only,17
And falls on the other.,17
How now! what news?,17
Hath he ask'd for me?,17
We will proceed no further in this business:,17
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,17
Not cast aside so soon.,17
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?,17
At what it did so freely? From this time,17
To be the same in thine own act and valour,17
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,17
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would',17
Prithee peace:,17
Who dares do more is none.,17
That made you break this enterprise to me?,17
And to be more than what you were you would,17
Did then adhere and yet you would make both:,17
Does unmake you. I have given suck and know,17
I would while it was smiling in my face,17
And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you,17
If we should fail?,17
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,17
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey,17
Will I with wine and wassail so convince,17
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason,17
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,17
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon,17
Of our great quell?,17
For thy undaunted mettle should compose,17
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two,17
That they have done't?,17
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar,17
I am settled and bend up,17
Away and mock the time with fairest show:,17
Exeunt,17
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.,17
How goes the night boy?,17
And she goes down at twelve.,17
Hold take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;,17
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,17
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature,17
Enter MACBETH and a Servant with a torch,17
Who's there?,17
What sir not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:,17
Sent forth great largess to your offices.,17
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up,17
Being unprepared,17
Which else should free have wrought.,17
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:,17
I think not of them:,17
We would spend it in some words upon that business,17
At your kind'st leisure.,17
It shall make honour for you.,17
In seeking to augment it but still keep,17
I shall be counsell'd.,17
Thanks sir: the like to you!,17
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready,17
Exit Servant,17
The handle toward my hand? Come let me clutch thee.,17
Art thou not fatal vision sensible,17
A dagger of the mind a false creation,17
I see thee yet in form as palpable,17
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;,17
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,17
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,17
It is the bloody business which informs,17
Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse,17
Pale Hecate's offerings and wither'd murder,17
Whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace.,17
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,17
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,17
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat he lives:,17
A bell rings,17
Hear it not Duncan; for it is a knell,17
Exit,17
Enter LADY MACBETH,17
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.,17
It was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman,17
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms,17
their possets,17
Whether they live or die.,17
Alack I am afraid they have awaked,17
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;,17
My father as he slept I had done't.,17
My husband!,17
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.,17
When?,17
As I descended?,17
Hark!,17
Donalbain.,17
Looking on his hands,17
There's one did laugh in's sleep and one cried,17
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:,17
Again to sleep.,17
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;,17
Listening their fear I could not say 'Amen',17
Consider it not so deeply.,17
I had most need of blessing and 'Amen',17
These deeds must not be thought,17
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!,17
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,17
Balm of hurt minds great nature's second course,17
What do you mean?,17
Glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore Cawdor,17
Who was it that thus cried? Why worthy thane,17
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,17
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?,17
The sleepy grooms with blood.,17
I am afraid to think what I have done;,17
Infirm of purpose!,17
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood,17
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;,17
Exit. Knocking within,17
How is't with me when every noise appals me?,17
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood,17
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,17
Re-enter LADY MACBETH,17
To wear a heart so white.,17
I hear a knocking,17
A little water clears us of this deed:,17
Hath left you unattended.,17
Hark! more knocking.,17
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost,17
To know my deed 'twere best not know myself.,17
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!,17
SCENE III. The same.,17
Here's a knocking indeed! If a,17
old turning the key.,17
Knock,17
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer that hanged,17
time; have napkins enow about you; here,17
Knocking within,17
knock! Who's there in the other devil's,17
swear in both the scales against either scale;,17
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O come,17
Knocking within,17
knock knock! Who's there? Faith here's an,17
a French hose: come in tailor; here you may,17
Knocking within,17
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But,17
it no further: I had thought to have let in,17
way to the everlasting bonfire.,17
Anon anon! I pray you remember the porter.,17
Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX,17
That you do lie so late?,17
second cock: and drink sir is a great,17
What three things does drink especially provoke?,17
urine. Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes;,17
away the performance: therefore much drink,17
it makes him and it mars him; it sets,17
and disheartens him; makes him stand to and,17
in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him.,17
That it did sir i' the very throat on,17
think being too strong for him though he took,17
him.,17
Enter MACBETH,17
Good morrow noble sir.,17
Is the king stirring worthy thane?,17
He did command me to call timely on him:,17
I'll bring you to him.,17
But yet 'tis one.,17
This is the door.,17
For 'tis my limited service.,17
Goes the king hence to-day?,17
The night has been unruly: where we lay,17
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,17
Of dire combustion and confused events,17
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say the earth,17
Twas a rough night.,17
A fellow to it.,17
O horror horror horror! Tongue nor heart,17
What's the matter.,17
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope,17
The life o' the building!,17
Mean you his majesty?,17
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;,17
Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX,17
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!,17
Shake off this downy sleep death's counterfeit,17
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!,17
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.,17
Enter LADY MACBETH,17
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley,17
O gentle lady,17
The repetition in a woman's ear,17
Enter BANQUO,17
Our royal master 's murder'd!,17
What in our house?,17
Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself,17
Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX with ROSS,17
I had lived a blessed time; for from this instant,17
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;,17
Is left this vault to brag of.,17
What is amiss?,17
The spring the head the fountain of your blood,17
Your royal father 's murder'd.,17
Those of his chamber as it seem'd had done 't:,17
So were their daggers which unwiped we found,17
They stared and were distracted; no man's life,17
O yet I do repent me of my fury,17
Wherefore did you so?,17
Loyal and neutral in a moment? No man:,17
Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan,17
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature,17
Steep'd in the colours of their trade their daggers,17
That had a heart to love and in that heart,17
Help me hence ho!,17
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,17
[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,17
Hid in an auger-hole may rush and seize us?,17
Our tears are not yet brew'd.,17
Upon the foot of motion.,17
LADY MACBETH is carried out,17
That suffer in exposure let us meet,17
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:,17
Against the undivulged pretence I fight,17
And so do I.,17
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,17
Well contented.,17
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:,17
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.,17
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,17
The nearer bloody.,17
Hath not yet lighted and our safest way,17
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,17
Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.,17
SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.,17
Threescore and ten I can remember well:,17
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night,17
Ah good father,17
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock 'tis day,17
Is't night's predominance or the day's shame,17
When living light should kiss it?,17
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,17
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.,17
Beauteous and swift the minions of their race,17
Contending 'gainst obedience as they would make,17
Tis said they eat each other.,17
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.,17
How goes the world sir now?,17
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?,17
Alas the day!,17
They were suborn'd:,17
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them,17
Gainst nature still!,17
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like,17
He is already named and gone to Scone,17
Where is Duncan's body?,17
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,17
Will you to Scone?,17
Well I will thither.,17
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!,17
God's benison go with you; and with those,17
Exeunt,17
SCENE I. Forres. The palace.,17
Thou hast it now: king Cawdor Glamis all,17
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said,17
But that myself should be the root and father,17
As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine--,17
May they not be my oracles as well,17
Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH as king LADY  MACBETH as queen LENNOX ROSS Lords Ladies and Attendants,17
If he had been forgotten,17
And all-thing unbecoming.,17
And I'll request your presence.,17
Command upon me; to the which my duties,17
For ever knit.,17
Ay my good lord.,17
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,17
Is't far you ride?,17
Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,17
For a dark hour or twain.,17
My lord I will not.,17
In England and in Ireland not confessing,17
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,17
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,17
Ay my good lord: our time does call upon 's.,17
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.,17
Let every man be master of his time,17
The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself,17
Exeunt all but MACBETH and an attendant,17
Our pleasure?,17
Bring them before us.,17
To be thus is nothing;,17
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature,17
And to that dauntless temper of his mind,17
To act in safety. There is none but he,17
My Genius is rebuked; as it is said,17
When first they put the name of king upon me,17
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:,17
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,17
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,17
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;,17
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel,17
To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings!,17
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!,17
Now go to the door and stay there till we call.,17
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?,17
Well then now,17
That it was he in the times past which held you,17
Our innocent self: this I made good to you,17
How you were borne in hand how cross'd,17
Who wrought with them and all things else that might,17
Say 'Thus did Banquo.',17
I did so and went further which is now,17
Your patience so predominant in your nature,17
To pray for this good man and for his issue,17
And beggar'd yours for ever?,17
Ay in the catalogue ye go for men;,17
Shoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept,17
Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle,17
According to the gift which bounteous nature,17
Particular addition. from the bill,17
Now if you have a station in the file,17
And I will put that business in your bosoms,17
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,17
Which in his death were perfect.,17
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world,17
I do to spite the world.,17
So weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune,17
To mend it or be rid on't.,17
Know Banquo was your enemy.,17
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,17
Against my near'st of life: and though I could,17
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not,17
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall,17
That I to your assistance do make love,17
For sundry weighty reasons.,17
Perform what you command us.,17
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,17
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,17
And something from the palace; always thought,17
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--,17
Whose absence is no less material to me,17
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:,17
We are resolved my lord.,17
Exeunt Murderers,17
If it find heaven must find it out to-night.,17
SCENE II. The palace.,17
Is Banquo gone from court?,17
Say to the king I would attend his leisure,17
Madam I will.,17
Nought's had all's spent,17
Tis safer to be that which we destroy,17
Enter MACBETH,17
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,17
With them they think on? Things without all remedy,17
We have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it:,17
Remains in danger of her former tooth.,17
worlds suffer,17
In the affliction of these terrible dreams,17
Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace,17
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;,17
Treason has done his worst: nor steel nor poison,17
Can touch him further.,17
Gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks;,17
So shall I love; and so I pray be you:,17
Present him eminence both with eye and tongue:,17
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,17
Disguising what they are.,17
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife!,17
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.,17
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown,17
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums,17
A deed of dreadful note.,17
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck,17
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;,17
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond,17
Makes wing to the rooky wood:,17
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.,17
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.,17
Exeunt,17
Enter three Murderers,17
Macbeth.,17
Our offices and what we have to do,17
Then stand with us.,17
Now spurs the lated traveller apace,17
The subject of our watch.,17
[Within]  Give us a light there ho!,17
That are within the note of expectation,17
His horses go about.,17
So all men do from hence to the palace gate,17
A light a light!,17
Tis he.,17
It will be rain to-night.,17
They set upon BANQUO,17
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!,17
Who did strike out the light?,17
There's but one down; the son is fled.,17
Best half of our affair.,17
Exeunt,17
A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH LADY MACBETH ROSS LENNOX Lords and Attendants,17
And last the hearty welcome.,17
Ourself will mingle with society,17
Our hostess keeps her state but in best time,17
Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends;,17
First Murderer appears at the door,17
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:,17
The table round.,17
There's blood on thy face.,17
Tis better thee without than he within.,17
My lord his throat is cut; that I did for him.,17
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,17
Most royal sir,17
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,17
As broad and general as the casing air:,17
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?,17
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;,17
Thanks for that:,17
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,17
We'll hear ourselves again.,17
My royal lord,17
That is not often vouch'd while 'tis a-making,17
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;,17
Sweet remembrancer!,17
And health on both!,17
The GHOST OF BANQUO enters and sits in MACBETH's place,17
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;,17
Than pity for mischance!,17
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness,17
The table's full.,17
Where?,17
Which of you have done this?,17
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake,17
Gentlemen rise: his highness is not well.,17
And hath been from his youth: pray you keep seat;,17
He will again be well: if much you note him,17
Feed and regard him not. Are you a man?,17
Which might appal the devil.,17
This is the very painting of your fear:,17
Led you to Duncan. O these flaws and starts,17
A woman's story at a winter's fire,17
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,17
Prithee see there! behold! look! lo!,17
Why what care I? If thou canst nod speak too.,17
Those that we bury back our monuments,17
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes,17
If I stand here I saw him.,17
Blood hath been shed ere now i' the olden time,17
Ay and since too murders have been perform'd,17
That when the brains were out the man would die,17
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,17
Than such a murder is.,17
Your noble friends do lack you.,17
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends,17
To those that know me. Come love and health to all;,17
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,17
Would he were here! to all and him we thirst,17
Our duties and the pledge.,17
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!,17
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,17
Think of this good peers,17
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.,17
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,17
Take any shape but that and my firm nerves,17
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;,17
The baby of a girl. Hence horrible shadow!,17
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes,17
I am a man again. Pray you sit still.,17
With most admired disorder.,17
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,17
Even to the disposition that I owe,17
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,17
What sights my lord?,17
Question enrages him. At once good night:,17
But go at once.,17
Attend his majesty!,17
Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH,17
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;,17
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth,17
Almost at odds with morning which is which.,17
At our great bidding?,17
I hear it by the way; but I will send:,17
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,17
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,17
All causes shall give way: I am in blood,17
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:,17
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.,17
Come we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse,17
We are yet but young in deed.,17
SCENE V. A Heath.,17
Why how now Hecate! you look angerly.,17
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare,17
In riddles and affairs of death;,17
The close contriver of all harms,17
Or show the glory of our art?,17
Hath been but for a wayward son,17
Loves for his own ends not for you.,17
And at the pit of Acheron,17
Will come to know his destiny:,17
Your charms and every thing beside.,17
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:,17
Upon the corner of the moon,17
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:,17
Shall raise such artificial sprites,17
Shall draw him on to his confusion:,17
He hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear:,17
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.,17
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit see,17
Exit,17
Exeunt,17
Enter LENNOX and another Lord,17
Which can interpret further: only I say,17
gracious Duncan,17
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;,17
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.,17
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain,17
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,17
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?,17
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive,17
He has borne all things well: and I do think,17
As an't please heaven he shall not--they,17
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.,17
His presence at the tyrant's feast I hear,17
Where he bestows himself?,17
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,17
Of the most pious Edward with such grace,17
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff,17
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:,17
To ratify the work--we may again,17
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,17
All which we pine for now: and this report,17
Prepares for some attempt of war.,17
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir not I',17
And hums as who should say 'You'll rue the time,17
And that well might,17
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel,17
His message ere he come that a swift blessing,17
Under a hand accursed!,17
Exeunt,17
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle a boiling cauldron.,17
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.,17
Harpier cries 'Tis time 'tis time.,17
In the poison'd entrails throw.,17
Days and nights has thirty-one,17
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.,17
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.,17
In the cauldron boil and bake;,17
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,17
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,17
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.,17
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.,17
Witches' mummy maw and gulf,17
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,17
Gall of goat and slips of yew,17
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,17
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,17
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,17
Double double toil and trouble;,17
Cool it with a baboon's blood,17
Enter HECATE to the other three Witches,17
And every one shall share i' the gains;,17
Live elves and fairies in a ring,17
Music and a song: 'Black spirits'  and c,17
By the pricking of my thumbs,17
Open locks,17
Enter MACBETH,17
What is't you do?,17
I conjure you by that which you profess,17
Though you untie the winds and let them fight,17
Confound and swallow navigation up;,17
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;,17
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure,17
Even till destruction sicken; answer me,17
Speak.,17
We'll answer.,17
Or from our masters?,17
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten,17
From the murderer's gibbet throw,17
Come high or low;,17
Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head,17
He knows thy thought:,17
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;,17
Descends,17
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one,17
He will not be commanded: here's another,17
Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child,17
Had I three ears I'ld hear thee.,17
The power of man for none of woman born,17
Descends,17
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,17
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,17
Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned with a tree in his hand,17
That rises like the issue of a king,17
And top of sovereignty?,17
Be lion-mettled proud; and take no care,17
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until,17
Shall come against him.,17
That will never be,17
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!,17
Of Birnam rise and our high-placed Macbeth,17
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart,17
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever,17
Seek to know no more.,17
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.,17
Hautboys,17
Show!,17
Show his eyes and grieve his heart;,17
A show of Eight Kings the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following,17
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,17
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!,17
What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?,17
And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass,17
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:,17
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,17
Apparitions vanish,17
Ay sir all this is so: but why,17
Come sisters cheer we up his sprites,17
I'll charm the air to give a sound,17
That this great king may kindly say,17
Music. The witches dance and then vanish with HECATE,17
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!,17
Enter LENNOX,17
Saw you the weird sisters?,17
Came they not by you?,17
Infected be the air whereon they ride;,17
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?,17
Macduff is fled to England.,17
Ay my good lord.,17
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,17
The very firstlings of my heart shall be,17
To crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done:,17
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword,17
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;,17
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?,17
Exeunt,17
Enter LADY MACDUFF her Son and ROSS,17
You must have patience madam.,17
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,17
You know not,17
Wisdom! to leave his wife to leave his babes,17
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;,17
The most diminutive of birds will fight,17
All is the fear and nothing is the love;,17
So runs against all reason.,17
I pray you school yourself: but for your husband,17
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak,17
But cruel are the times when we are traitors,17
From what we fear yet know not what we fear,17
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:,17
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward,17
Blessing upon you!,17
I am so much a fool should I stay longer,17
I take my leave at once.,17
Sirrah your father's dead;,17
As birds do mother.,17
With what I get I mean; and so do they.,17
The pitfall nor the gin.,17
My father is not dead for all your saying.,17
Nay how will you do for a husband?,17
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.,17
With wit enough for thee.,17
Ay that he was.,17
Why one that swears and lies.,17
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.,17
Every one.,17
Why  the honest men.,17
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat,17
Now God help thee poor monkey!,17
If he were dead you'ld weep for,17
that I should quickly have a new father.,17
Enter a Messenger,17
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.,17
If you will take a homely man's advice,17
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;,17
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!,17
Exit,17
I have done no harm. But I remember now,17
Is often laudable to do good sometime,17
Do I put up that womanly defence,17
Enter Murderers,17
Where is your husband?,17
Where such as thou mayst find him.,17
Thou liest thou shag-hair'd villain!,17
Stabbing him,17
He has kill'd me mother:,17
Dies,17
SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.,17
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there,17
Let us rather,17
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn,17
Strike heaven on the face that it resounds,17
Like syllable of dolour.,17
What know believe and what I can redress,17
What you have spoke it may be so perchance.,17
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.,17
but something,17
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb,17
I am not treacherous.,17
A good and virtuous nature may recoil,17
your pardon;,17
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell;,17
Yet grace must still look so.,17
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.,17
Those precious motives those strong knots of love,17
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,17
Whatever I shall think.,17
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,17
thy wrongs;,17
I would not be the villain that thou think'st,17
And the rich East to boot.,17
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.,17
It weeps it bleeds; and each new day a gash,17
There would be hands uplifted in my right;,17
Of goodly thousands: but for all this,17
Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country,17
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,17
What should he be?,17
All the particulars of vice so grafted,17
Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state,17
With my confineless harms.,17
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd,17
I grant him bloody,17
Sudden malicious smacking of every sin,17
In my voluptuousness: your wives your daughters,17
The cistern of my lust and my desire,17
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth,17
Boundless intemperance,17
The untimely emptying of the happy throne,17
To take upon you what is yours: you may,17
And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink.,17
That vulture in you to devour so many,17
Finding it so inclined.,17
In my most ill-composed affection such,17
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,17
And my more-having would be as a sauce,17
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,17
This avarice,17
Than summer-seeming lust and it hath been,17
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.,17
With other graces weigh'd.,17
As justice verity temperance stableness,17
Devotion patience courage fortitude,17
In the division of each several crime,17
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,17
All unity on earth.,17
If such a one be fit to govern speak:,17
Fit to govern!,17
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,17
Since that the truest issue of thy throne,17
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father,17
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,17
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself,17
Thy hope ends here!,17
Child of integrity hath from my soul,17
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth,17
Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me,17
Deal between thee and me! for even now,17
Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure,17
For strangers to my nature. I am yet,17
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,17
The devil to his fellow and delight,17
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,17
Whither indeed before thy here-approach,17
Already at a point was setting forth.,17
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?,17
Tis hard to reconcile.,17
Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth I pray you?,17
That stay his cure: their malady convinces,17
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--,17
I thank you doctor.,17
What's the disease he means?,17
A most miraculous work in this good king;,17
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,17
All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye,17
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,17
To the succeeding royalty he leaves,17
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,17
That speak him full of grace.,17
See who comes here?,17
My ever-gentle cousin welcome hither.,17
The means that makes us strangers!,17
Stands Scotland where it did?,17
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot,17
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;,17
Are made not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems,17
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives,17
Dying or ere they sicken.,17
Too nice and yet too true!,17
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:,17
How does my wife?,17
And all my children?,17
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?,17
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?,17
Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumour,17
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,17
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland,17
To doff their dire distresses.,17
We are coming thither: gracious England hath,17
An older and a better soldier none,17
Would I could answer,17
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,17
What concern they?,17
Due to some single breast?,17
But in it shares some woe; though the main part,17
If it be mine,17
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,17
That ever yet they heard.,17
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes,17
Were on the quarry of these murder'd deer,17
Merciful heaven!,17
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak,17
My children too?,17
That could be found.,17
My wife kill'd too?,17
Be comforted:,17
To cure this deadly grief.,17
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?,17
At one fell swoop?,17
I shall do so;,17
I cannot but remember such things were,17
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,17
Not for their own demerits but for mine,17
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief,17
O I could play the woman with mine eyes,17
Cut short all intermission; front to front,17
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,17
This tune goes manly.,17
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth,17
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:,17
Exeunt,17
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.,17
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive,17
Since his majesty went into the field I have seen,17
her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it,17
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.,17
the benefit of sleep and do the effects of,17
walking and other actual performances what at any,17
That sir which I will not report after her.,17
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to,17
Enter LADY MACBETH with a taper,17
and upon my life fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.,17
Why it stood by her: she has light by her,17
You see her eyes are open.,17
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.,17
washing her hands: I have known her continue in,17
Yet here's a spot.,17
her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.,17
then 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie my,17
fear who knows it when none can call our power to,17
to have had so much blood in him.,17
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--,17
that my lord no more o' that: you mar all with,17
Go to go to; you have known what you should not.,17
that: heaven knows what she has known.,17
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little,17
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.,17
dignity of the whole body.,17
Pray God it be sir.,17
those which have walked in their sleep who have died,17
Wash your hands put on your nightgown; look not so,17
cannot come out on's grave.,17
To bed to bed! there's knocking at the gate:,17
done cannot be undone.--To bed to bed to bed!,17
Will she go now to bed?,17
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds,17
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:,17
God God forgive us all! Look after her;,17
And still keep eyes upon her. So good night:,17
I think but dare not speak.,17
Exeunt,17
Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH CAITHNESS ANGUS LENNOX and Soldiers,17
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:,17
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm,17
Near Birnam wood,17
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?,17
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,17
Protest their first of manhood.,17
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:,17
Do call it valiant fury: but for certain,17
Within the belt of rule.,17
His secret murders sticking on his hands;,17
Those he commands move only in command,17
Hang loose about him like a giant's robe,17
Who then shall blame,17
When all that is within him does condemn,17
Well march we on,17
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,17
Each drop of us.,17
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.,17
Exeunt marching,17
Enter MACBETH Doctor and Attendants,17
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,17
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know,17
Fear not Macbeth; no man that's born of woman,17
false thanes,17
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear,17
Enter a Servant,17
Where got'st thou that goose look?,17
Geese villain!,17
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,17
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine,17
The English force so please you.,17
Exit Servant,17
When I behold--Seyton I say!--This push,17
I have lived long enough: my way of life,17
And that which should accompany old age,17
I must not look to have; but in their stead,17
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not. Seyton!,17
What is your gracious pleasure?,17
All is confirm'd my lord which was reported.,17
Give me my armour.,17
I'll put it on.,17
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.,17
Not so sick my lord,17
That keep her from her rest.,17
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,17
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,17
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff,17
Therein the patient,17
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.,17
Seyton send out. Doctor the thanes fly from me.,17
The water of my land find her disease,17
I would applaud thee to the very echo,17
What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug,17
Ay my good lord; your royal preparation,17
Bring it after me.,17
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.,17
Profit again should hardly draw me here.,17
SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.,17
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand,17
We doubt it nothing.,17
The wood of Birnam.,17
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow,17
Err in report of us.,17
We learn no other but the confident tyrant,17
Our setting down before 't.,17
For where there is advantage to be given,17
And none serve with him but constrained things,17
Let our just censures,17
Industrious soldiership.,17
That will with due decision make us know,17
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,17
Towards which advance the war.,17
SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.,17
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;,17
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie,17
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,17
And beat them backward home.,17
What is that noise?,17
Exit,17
The time has been my senses would have cool'd,17
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir,17
Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,17
Re-enter SEYTON,17
The queen my lord is dead.,17
There would have been a time for such a word.,17
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,17
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools,17
Life's but a walking shadow a poor player,17
And then is heard no more: it is a tale,17
Signifying nothing.,17
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.,17
I should report that which I say I saw,17
Well say sir.,17
I look'd toward Birnam and anon methought,17
Liar and slave!,17
Within this three mile may you see it coming;,17
If thou speak'st false,17
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,17
I pull in resolution and begin,17
That lies like truth: 'Fear not till Birnam wood,17
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm arm and out!,17
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.,17
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.,17
At least we'll die with harness on our back.,17
SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.,17
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.,17
Shall with my cousin your right-noble son,17
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,17
Fare you well.,17
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.,17
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.,17
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.,17
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,17
That was not born of woman? Such a one,17
Enter YOUNG SIWARD,17
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.,17
Than any is in hell.,17
The devil himself could not pronounce a title,17
No nor more fearful.,17
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.,17
Thou wast born of woman,17
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.,17
Alarums. Enter MACDUFF,17
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,17
I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms,17
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge,17
By this great clatter one of greatest note,17
And more I beg not.,17
Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD,17
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;,17
The day almost itself professes yours,17
We have met with foes,17
Enter sir the castle.,17
SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.,17
Why should I play the Roman fool and die,17
Do better upon them.,17
Turn hell-hound turn!,17
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged,17
I have no words:,17
Than terms can give thee out!,17
Thou losest labour:,17
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:,17
I bear a charmed life which must not yield,17
Despair thy charm;,17
Tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb,17
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,17
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,17
That keep the word of promise to our ear,17
Then yield thee coward,17
We'll have thee as our rarer monsters are,17
Here may you see the tyrant.',17
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,17
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,17
Yet I will try the last. Before my body,17
And damn'd be him that first cries 'Hold enough!',17
Retreat. Flourish. Enter with drum and colours MALCOLM SIWARD ROSS the other Thanes and Soldiers,17
Some must go off: and yet by these I see,17
Macduff is missing and your noble son.,17
He only lived but till he was a man;,17
In the unshrinking station where he fought,17
Then he is dead?,17
Must not be measured by his worth for then,17
Had he his hurts before?,17
Why then God's soldier be he!,17
I would not wish them to a fairer death:,17
He's worth more sorrow,17
He's worth no more,17
And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.,17
Hail king! for so thou art: behold where stands,17
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,17
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:,17
Hail King of Scotland!,17
We shall not spend a large expense of time,17
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,17
In such an honour named. What's more to do,17
As calling home our exiled friends abroad,17
Producing forth the cruel ministers,17
Who as 'tis thought by self and violent hands,17
That calls upon us by the grace of Grace,17
So thanks to all at once and to each one,17
Flourish. Exeunt,17
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.,18
Escalus.,18
Of government the properties to unfold,18
Since I am put to know that your own science,18
My strength can give you: then no more remains,18
And let them work. The nature of our people,18
For common justice you're as pregnant in,18
That we remember. There is our commission,18
I say bid come before us Angelo.,18
What figure of us think you he will bear?,18
Elected him our absence to supply,18
And given his deputation all the organs,18
If any in Vienna be of worth,18
It is Lord Angelo.,18
Enter ANGELO,18
I come to know your pleasure.,18
There is a kind of character in thy life,18
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings,18
Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee.,18
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues,18
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd,18
The smallest scruple of her excellence,18
Herself the glory of a creditor,18
To one that can my part in him advertise;,18
In our remove be thou at full ourself;,18
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,18
Take thy commission.,18
Let there be some more test made of my metal,18
Be stamp'd upon it.,18
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice,18
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition,18
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,18
How it goes with us and do look to know,18
To the hopeful execution do I leave you,18
Yet give leave my lord,18
My haste may not admit it;,18
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own,18
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:,18
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:,18
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;,18
That does affect it. Once more fare you well.,18
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!,18
Exit,18
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me,18
A power I have but of what strength and nature,18
Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,18
Touching that point.,18
Exeunt,18
Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen,18
composition with the King of Hungary why then all,18
Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of,18
Amen.,18
went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scraped,18
Thou shalt not steal'?,18
Why 'twas a commandment to command the captain and,18
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all that in,18
well that prays for peace.,18
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where,18
No? a dozen times at least.,18
In any proportion or in any language.,18
Ay why not? Grace is grace despite of all,18
wicked villain despite of all grace.,18
I grant; as there may between the lists and the,18
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt,18
be a list of an English kersey as be piled as thou,18
feelingly now?,18
feeling of thy speech: I will out of thine own,18
live forget to drink after thee.,18
Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free.,18
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--,18
Judge.,18
Ay and more.,18
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou,18
Nay not as one would say healthy; but so sound as,18
impiety has made a feast of thee.,18
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?,18
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.,18
Marry sir that's Claudio Signior Claudio.,18
Nay but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested saw,18
three days his head to be chopped off.,18
Art thou sure of this?,18
Julietta with child.,18
hours since and he was ever precise in,18
Besides you know it draws something near to the,18
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.,18
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen,18
with the gallows and what with poverty I am,18
Enter POMPEY,18
Yonder man is carried to prison.,18
A woman.,18
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.,18
No but there's a woman with maid by him. You have,18
What proclamation man?,18
And what shall become of those in the city?,18
but that a wise burgher put in for them.,18
pulled down?,18
Why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!,18
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no,18
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.,18
have worn your eyes almost out in the service you,18
What's to do here Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.,18
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.,18
Enter Provost CLAUDIO JULIET and Officers,18
Bear me to prison where I am committed.,18
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.,18
Make us pay down for our offence by weight,18
On whom it will not so; yet still 'tis just.,18
Why how now Claudio! whence comes this restraint?,18
As surfeit is the father of much fast,18
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,18
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.,18
send for certain of my creditors: and yet to say,18
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy,18
What but to speak of would offend again.,18
No.,18
Call it so.,18
One word good friend. Lucio a word with you.,18
Is lechery so look'd after?,18
I got possession of Julietta's bed:,18
Save that we do the denunciation lack,18
Only for propagation of a dower,18
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love,18
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,18
With child perhaps?,18
And the new deputy now for the duke--,18
Or whether that the body public be,18
Who newly in the seat that it may know,18
Whether the tyranny be in his place,18
I stagger in:--but this new governor,18
Which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall,18
And none of them been worn; and for a name,18
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.,18
thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love,18
him.,18
I prithee Lucio do me this kind service:,18
And there receive her approbation:,18
Implore her in my voice that she make friends,18
I have great hope in that; for in her youth,18
Such as move men; beside she hath prosperous art,18
And well she can persuade.,18
like which else would stand under grievous,18
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a,18
I thank you good friend Lucio.,18
Come officer away!,18
SCENE III. A monastery.,18
No holy father; throw away that thought;,18
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee,18
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends,18
May your grace speak of it?,18
How I have ever loved the life removed,18
Where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps.,18
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,18
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;,18
And so it is received. Now pious sir,18
Gladly my lord.,18
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,18
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,18
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,18
For terror not to use in time the rod,18
Dead to infliction to themselves are dead;,18
The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart,18
It rested in your grace,18
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd,18
I do fear too dreadful:,18
Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them,18
When evil deeds have their permissive pass,18
I have on Angelo imposed the office;,18
And yet my nature never in the fight,18
I will as 'twere a brother of your order,18
Supply me with the habit and instruct me,18
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action,18
Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise;,18
That his blood flows or that his appetite,18
If power change purpose what our seemers be.,18
SCENE IV. A nunnery.,18
And have you nuns no farther privileges?,18
Yes truly; I speak not as desiring more;,18
Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare.,18
Who's that which calls?,18
Turn you the key and know his business of him;,18
When you have vow'd you must not speak with men,18
Then if you speak you must not show your face,18
He calls again; I pray you answer him.,18
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls,18
Hail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses,18
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,18
To her unhappy brother Claudio?,18
The rather for I now must make you know,18
Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you:,18
Woe me! for what?,18
He should receive his punishment in thanks:,18
Sir make me not your story.,18
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin,18
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:,18
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,18
As with a saint.,18
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth 'tis thus:,18
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time,18
To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb,18
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?,18
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names,18
She it is.,18
This is the point.,18
Bore many gentlemen myself being one,18
By those that know the very nerves of state,18
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,18
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood,18
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,18
With profits of the mind study and fast.,18
Which have for long run by the hideous law,18
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life,18
And follows close the rigour of the statute,18
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer,18
Twixt you and your poor brother.,18
Has censured him,18
A warrant for his execution.,18
To do him good?,18
My power? Alas I doubt--,18
And make us lose the good we oft might win,18
And let him learn to know when maidens sue,18
All their petitions are as freely theirs,18
I'll see what I can do.,18
I will about it straight;,18
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:,18
I'll send him certain word of my success.,18
Good sir adieu.,18
ACT II,18
Enter ANGELO ESCALUS and a Justice Provost Officers and other Attendants behind,18
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,18
Their perch and not their terror.,18
Let us be keen and rather cut a little,18
Whom I would save had a most noble father!,18
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,18
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,18
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,18
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,18
Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus,18
The jury passing on the prisoner's life,18
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,18
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,18
Because we see it; but what we do not see,18
You may not so extenuate his offence,18
When I that censure him do so offend,18
And nothing come in partial. Sir he must die.,18
Where is the provost?,18
See that Claudio,18
Bring him his confessor let him be prepared;,18
Exit Provost,18
Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall:,18
And some condemned for a fault alone.,18
Come bring them away: if these be good people in,18
common houses I know no law: bring them away.,18
If it Please your honour I am the poor duke's,18
justice sir and do bring in here before your good,18
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are,18
If it? please your honour I know not well what they,18
of; and void of all profanation in the world that,18
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.,18
name? why dost thou not speak Elbow?,18
What are you sir?,18
serves a bad woman; whose house sir was as they,18
professes a hot-house which I think is a very ill house too.,18
My wife sir whom I detest before heaven and your honour--,18
Ay sir; whom I thank heaven is an honest woman--,18
I say sir I will detest myself also as well as,18
it is pity of her life for it is a naughty house.,18
Marry sir by my wife; who if she had been a woman,18
fornication adultery and all uncleanliness there.,18
Ay sir by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she,18
Sir if it please your honour this is not so.,18
man; prove it.,18
Sir she came in great with child; and longing,18
sir we had but two in the house which at that very,18
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen,18
good dishes--,18
No indeed sir not of a pin; you are therein in,18
Mistress Elbow being as I say with child and,18
prunes; and having but two in the dish as I said,18
rest as I said and as I say paying for them very,18
not give you three-pence again.,18
Very well: you being then if you be remembered,18
Ay so I did indeed.,18
remembered that such a one and such a one were past,18
good diet as I told you--,18
Why very well then--,18
was done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to,18
Sir your honour cannot come to that yet.,18
Sir but you shall come to it by your honour's,18
here sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose,18
Master Froth?,18
Why very well; I hope here be truths. He sir,18
the Bunch of Grapes where indeed you have a delight,18
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.,18
This will last out a night in Russia,18
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;,18
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.,18
Now sir come on: what was done to Elbow's wife once more?,18
I beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife.,18
Well sir; what did this gentleman to her?,18
Good Master Froth look upon his honour; 'tis for a,18
Ay sir very well.,18
Well I do so.,18
Why no.,18
thing about him. Good then; if his face be the,18
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of,18
He's in the right. Constable what say you to it?,18
house; next this is a respected fellow; and his,18
By this hand sir his wife is a more respected,18
Varlet thou liest; thou liest wicked varlet! the,18
with man woman or child.,18
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is,18
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked,18
to her! If ever I was respected with her or she,18
duke's officer. Prove this thou wicked Hannibal or,18
If he took you a box o' the ear you might have your,18
Marry I thank your good worship for it. What is't,18
Truly officer because he hath some offences in him,18
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they,18
Marry I thank your worship for it. Thou seest thou,18
to continue now thou varlet; thou art to continue.,18
Here in Vienna sir.,18
Yes an't please you sir.,18
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.,18
Mistress Overdone.,18
Nine sir; Overdone by the last.,18
Froth I would not have you acquainted with,18
will hang them. Get you gone and let me hear no,18
I thank your worship. For mine own part I never,18
in.,18
Exit FROTH,18
name Master tapster?,18
What else?,18
Troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you;,18
Great. Pompey you are partly a bawd Pompey,18
not? come tell me true: it shall be the better for you.,18
How would you live Pompey? by being a bawd? What,18
If the law would allow it sir.,18
not be allowed in Vienna.,18
youth of the city?,18
Truly sir in my poor opinion they will to't then.,18
the knaves you need not to fear the bawds.,18
it is but heading and hanging.,18
for ten year together you'll be glad to give out a,18
Vienna ten year I'll rent the fairest house in it,18
come to pass say Pompey told you so.,18
prophecy hark you: I advise you let me not find,18
no not for dwelling where you do: if I do Pompey,18
Caesar to you; in plain dealing Pompey I shall,18
I thank your worship for your good counsel:,18
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall,18
Whip me? No no; let carman whip his jade:,18
Exit,18
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?,18
I thought by your readiness in the office you had,18
And a half sir.,18
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men,18
Faith sir few of any wit in such matters: as they,18
do it for some piece of money and go through with,18
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,18
To your worship's house sir?,18
Exit ELBOW,18
Eleven sir.,18
I humbly thank you.,18
But there's no remedy.,18
It is but needful:,18
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:,18
Come sir.,18
SCENE II. Another room in the same.,18
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight,18
Pray you do.,18
I'll know,18
He hath but as offended in a dream!,18
To die for't!,18
Now what's the matter. Provost?,18
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?,18
Lest I might be too rash:,18
When after execution judgment hath,18
Go to; let that be mine:,18
And you shall well be spared.,18
What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet?,18
Dispose of her,18
Re-enter Servant,18
Desires access to you.,18
Ay my good lord; a very virtuous maid,18
If not already.,18
Exit Servant,18
Let have needful but not lavish means;,18
Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO,18
Stay a little while.,18
You're welcome: what's your will?,18
Please but your honour hear me.,18
There is a vice that most I do abhor,18
For which I would not plead but that I must;,18
At war 'twixt will and will not.,18
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:,18
And not my brother.,18
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?,18
Mine were the very cipher of a function,18
And let go by the actor.,18
I had a brother then. Heaven keep your honour!,18
again entreat him;,18
You are too cold; if you should need a pin,18
To him I say!,18
Maiden no remedy.,18
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.,18
But can you if you would?,18
But might you do't and do the world no wrong,18
A s mine is to him?,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.,18
May call it back again. Well believe this,18
Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,18
Become them with one half so good a grace,18
If he had been as you and you as he,18
Would not have been so stern.,18
I would to heaven I had your potency,18
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,18
[Aside to ISABELLA],18
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,18
Alas alas!,18
And He that might the vantage best have took,18
If He which is the top of judgment should,18
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,18
Be you content fair maid;,18
Were he my kinsman brother or my son,18
To-morrow! O that's sudden! Spare him spare him!,18
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven,18
To our gross selves? Good good my lord bethink you;,18
There's many have committed it.,18
The law hath not been dead though it hath slept:,18
If the first that did the edict infringe,18
Takes note of what is done; and like a prophet,18
Either new or by remissness new-conceived,18
Are now to have no successive degrees,18
Yet show some pity.,18
For then I pity those I do not know,18
And do him right that answering one foul wrong,18
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.,18
And he that suffer's. O it is excellent,18
To use it like a giant.,18
Could great men thunder,18
For every pelting petty officer,18
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,18
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,18
Drest in a little brief authority,18
His glassy essence like an angry ape,18
As make the angels weep; who with our spleens,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  O to him to him wench! he,18
He's coming; I perceive 't.,18
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:,18
But in the less foul profanation.,18
That in the captain's but a choleric word,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.,18
Because authority though it err like others,18
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;,18
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess,18
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue,18
[Aside]                  She speaks and 'tis,18
Gentle my lord turn back.,18
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord turn back.,18
Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.,18
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,18
As fancy values them; but with true prayers,18
Ere sun-rise prayers from preserved souls,18
To nothing temporal.,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!,18
[Aside] Amen:,18
Where prayers cross.,18
Shall I attend your lordship?,18
Save your honour!,18
From thee even from thy virtue!,18
The tempter or the tempted who sins most?,18
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I,18
Do as the carrion does not as the flower,18
That modesty may more betray our sense,18
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,18
What dost thou or what art thou Angelo?,18
That make her good? O let her brother live!,18
When judges steal themselves. What do I love her,18
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?,18
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous,18
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,18
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid,18
When men were fond I smiled and wonder'd how.,18
SCENE III. A room in a prison.,18
Hail to you provost! so I think you are.,18
Bound by my charity and my blest order,18
Here in the prison. Do me the common right,18
The nature of their crimes that I may minister,18
I would do more than that if more were needful.,18
Look here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,18
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;,18
More fit to do another such offence,18
When must he die?,18
I have provided for you: stay awhile,18
And you shall be conducted.,18
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.,18
And try your penitence if it be sound,18
I'll gladly learn.,18
Yes as I love the woman that wrong'd him.,18
Was mutually committed?,18
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.,18
Tis meet so daughter: but lest you do repent,18
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven,18
But as we stand in fear--,18
And take the shame with joy.,18
Your partner as I hear must die to-morrow,18
Grace go with you Benedicite!,18
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,18
Is still a dying horror!,18
Exeunt,18
Enter ANGELO,18
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;,18
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,18
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil,18
Is like a good thing being often read,18
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,18
Which the air beats for vain. O place O form,18
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls,18
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:,18
Enter a Servant,18
One Isabel a sister desires access to you.,18
Exit Servant,18
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,18
And dispossessing all my other parts,18
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;,18
By which he should revive: and even so,18
Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness,18
Must needs appear offence.,18
How now fair maid?,18
That you might know it would much better please me,18
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!,18
As long as you or I yet he must die.,18
Yea.,18
Longer or shorter he may be so fitted,18
Ha! fie these filthy vices! It were as good,18
A man already made as to remit,18
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy,18
As to put metal in restrained means,18
Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth.,18
Which had you rather that the most just law,18
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness,18
Sir believe this,18
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins,18
How say you?,18
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:,18
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:,18
To save this brother's life?,18
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,18
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,18
That I do beg his life if it be sin,18
If that be sin I'll make it my morn prayer,18
And nothing of your answer.,18
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,18
Let me be ignorant and in nothing good,18
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright,18
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder,18
To be received plain I'll speak more gross:,18
So.,18
Accountant to the law upon that pain.,18
Admit no other way to save his life--,18
But in the loss of question--that you his sister,18
Whose credit with the judge or own great place,18
Of the all-building law; and that there were,18
You must lay down the treasures of your body,18
What would you do?,18
That is were I under the terms of death,18
And strip myself to death as to a bed,18
My body up to shame.,18
And 'twere the cheaper way:,18
Than that a sister by redeeming him,18
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence,18
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon,18
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.,18
And rather proved the sliding of your brother,18
O pardon me my lord; it oft falls out,18
I something do excuse the thing I hate,18
We are all frail.,18
If not a feodary but only he,18
Nay women are frail too.,18
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.,18
In profiting by them. Nay call us ten times frail;,18
And credulous to false prints.,18
And from this testimony of your own sex--,18
Than faults may shake our frames--let me be bold;,18
That is a woman; if you be more you're none;,18
By all external warrants show it now,18
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,18
Plainly conceive I love you.,18
And you tell me that he shall die for it.,18
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,18
To pluck on others.,18
My words express my purpose.,18
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming seeming!,18
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,18
What man thou art.,18
My unsoil'd name the austereness of my life,18
Will so your accusation overweigh,18
And smell of calumny. I have begun,18
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;,18
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother,18
Or else he must not only die the death,18
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,18
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,18
Exit,18
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,18
Either of condemnation or approof;,18
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,18
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,18
That had he twenty heads to tender down,18
Before his sister should her body stoop,18
Then Isabel live chaste and brother die:,18
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,18
Exit,18
SCENE I. A room in the prison.,18
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?,18
But only hope:,18
Be absolute for death; either death or life,18
If I do lose thee I do lose a thing,18
Servile to all the skyey influences,18
Hourly afflict: merely thou art death's fool;,18
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;,18
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;,18
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,18
Thy death which is no more. Thou art not thyself;,18
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;,18
And what thou hast forget'st. Thou art not certain;,18
After the moon. If thou art rich thou'rt poor;,18
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,18
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,18
Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum,18
But as it were an after-dinner's sleep,18
Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms,18
Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty,18
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life,18
That makes these odds all even.,18
To sue to live I find I seek to die;,18
[Within]  What ho! Peace here; grace and good company!,18
Dear sir ere long I'll visit you again.,18
Enter ISABELLA,18
And very welcome. Look signior here's your sister.,18
As many as you please.,18
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost,18
Why,18
Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven,18
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:,18
To-morrow you set on.,18
None but such remedy as to save a head,18
But is there any?,18
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,18
But fetter you till death.,18
Ay just; perpetual durance a restraint,18
To a determined scope.,18
In such a one as you consenting to't,18
And leave you naked.,18
O I do fear thee Claudio; and I quake,18
And six or seven winters more respect,18
The sense of death is most in apprehension;,18
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great,18
Why give you me this shame?,18
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,18
And hug it in mine arms.,18
Did utter forth a voice. Yes thou must die:,18
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,18
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew,18
His filth within being cast he would appear,18
The prenzie Angelo!,18
The damned'st body to invest and cover,18
If I would yield him my virginity,18
O heavens! it cannot be.,18
So to offend him still. This night's the time,18
Or else thou diest to-morrow.,18
O were it but my life,18
As frankly as a pin.,18
Be ready Claudio for your death tomorrow.,18
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,18
Or of the deadly seven it is the least.,18
If it were damnable he being so wise,18
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!,18
Death is a fearful thing.,18
Ay but to die and go we know not where;,18
This sensible warm motion to become,18
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside,18
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,18
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst,18
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!,18
That age ache penury and imprisonment,18
To what we fear of death.,18
Sweet sister let me live:,18
Nature dispenses with the deed so far,18
O you beast!,18
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?,18
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?,18
For such a warped slip of wilderness,18
Die perish! Might but my bending down,18
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,18
Nay hear me Isabel.,18
Thy sin's not accidental but a trade.,18
Tis best thou diest quickly.,18
Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO,18
What is your will?,18
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I,18
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be,18
Walks apart,18
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to,18
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition,18
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most,18
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to,18
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to,18
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love,18
Hold you there: farewell.,18
Provost a word with you!,18
What's your will father,18
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my,18
In good time.,18
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:,18
brief in goodness; but grace being the soul of,18
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,18
that frailty hath examples for his falling I should,18
substitute and to save your brother?,18
brother die by the law than my son should be,18
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can,18
discover his government.,18
now stands he will avoid your accusation; he made,18
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a,18
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged,18
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious,18
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of,18
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do,18
Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful. Have,18
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?,18
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced,18
which time of the contract and limit of the,18
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his,18
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and,18
kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of,18
combinate husband this well-seeming Angelo.,18
Left her in her tears and dried not one of them,18
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,18
wears for his sake; and he a marble to her tears,18
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid,18
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?,18
cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps,18
Show me how good father.,18
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness that,18
like an impediment in the current made it more,18
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with,18
this advantage first that your stay with him may,18
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.,18
all--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up,18
acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to,18
saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana,18
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you,18
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.,18
The image of it gives me content already; and I,18
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily,18
bed give him promise of satisfaction. I will,18
grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that,18
it may be quickly.,18
Exeunt severally,18
Enter on one side DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other ELBOW and Officers with POMPEY,18
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we,18
O heavens! what stuff is here,18
merriest was put down and the worser allowed by,18
furred with fox and lamb-skins too to signify that,18
Come your way sir. 'Bless you good father friar.,18
this man made you sir?,18
take him to be a thief too sir; for we have found,18
sent to the deputy.,18
The evil that thou causest to be done,18
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back,18
From their abominable and beastly touches,18
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,18
Indeed it does stink in some sort sir; but yet,18
Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,18
Correction and instruction must both work,18
He must before the deputy sir; he has given him,18
he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were,18
That we were all as some would seem to be,18
His neck will come to your waist--a cord sir.,18
friend of mine.,18
How now noble Pompey! What at the wheels of,18
none of Pygmalion's images newly made woman to be,18
extracting it clutch'd? What reply ha? What,18
not drowned i' the last rain ha? What sayest,18
the way? Is it sad and few words? or how? The,18
Still thus and thus; still worse!,18
still ha?,18
is herself in the tub.,18
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:,18
to prison Pompey?,18
Why 'tis not amiss Pompey. Farewell: go say I,18
For being a bawd for being a bawd.,18
due of a bawd why 'tis his right: bawd is he,18
Farewell good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,18
will keep the house.,18
No indeed will I not Pompey; it is not the wear.,18
you take it not patiently why your mettle is the,18
And you.,18
Come your ways sir; come.,18
Then Pompey nor now. What news abroad friar?,18
Come your ways sir; come.,18
Exeunt ELBOW POMPEY and Officers,18
I know none. Can you tell me of any?,18
some he is in Rome: but where is he think you?,18
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from,18
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he,18
He does well in 't.,18
him: something too crabbed that way friar.,18
Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred;,18
it quite friar till eating and drinking be put,18
woman after this downright way of creation: is it,18
How should he be made then?,18
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is,18
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a,18
You are pleasant sir and speak apace.,18
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a,18
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a,18
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he,18
I never heard the absent duke much detected for,18
O sir you are deceived.,18
Who not the duke? yes your beggar of fifty; and,18
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;,18
You do him wrong surely.,18
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his,18
What I prithee might be the cause?,18
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you,18
duke to be wise.,18
A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow.,18
the very stream of his life and the business he hath,18
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own,18
envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier.,18
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.,18
Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with,18
Come sir I know what I know.,18
you speak. But if ever the duke return as our,18
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,18
upon you; and I pray you your name?,18
He shall know you better sir if I may live to,18
I fear you not.,18
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I,18
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,18
Claudio die to-morrow or no?,18
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would,18
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with,18
house-eaves because they are lecherous. The duke,18
never bring them to light: would he were returned!,18
Farewell good friar: I prithee pray for me. The,18
Fridays. He's not past it yet and I say to thee,18
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.,18
No might nor greatness in mortality,18
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong,18
But who comes here?,18
Go; away with her to prison!,18
a merciful man; good my lord.,18
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play,18
A bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please,18
My lord this is one Lucio's information against me.,18
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child,18
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!,18
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;,18
Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE,18
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished,18
if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be,18
So please you this friar hath been with him and,18
Good even good father.,18
Of whence are you?,18
To use it for my time: I am a brother,18
In special business from his holiness.,18
None but that there is so great a fever on,18
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous,18
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce,18
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much,18
news is old enough yet it is every day's news. I,18
One that above all other strifes contended,18
What pleasure was he given to?,18
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a,18
his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous;,18
prepared. I am made to understand that you have,18
He professes to have received no sinister measure,18
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed,18
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good,18
resolved to die.,18
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have,18
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I,18
he is indeed Justice.,18
proceeding it shall become him well; wherein if he,18
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.,18
Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost,18
Should be as holy as severe;,18
Grace to stand and virtue go;,18
Than by self-offences weighing.,18
Kills for faults of his own liking!,18
To weed my vice and let his grow!,18
Though angel on the outward side!,18
Making practise on the times,18
Most ponderous and substantial things!,18
With Angelo to-night shall lie,18
So disguise shall by the disguised,18
And perform an old contracting.,18
ACT IV,18
Enter MARIANA and a Boy,18
Take O take those lips away,18
And those eyes the break of day,18
But my kisses bring again bring again;,18
Break off thy song and haste thee quick away:,18
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before,18
You had not found me here so musical:,18
My mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe.,18
To make bad good and good provoke to harm.,18
for me here to-day? much upon this time have,18
You have not been inquired after:,18
Enter ISABELLA,18
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may,18
I am always bound to you.,18
Very well met and well come.,18
He hath a garden circummured with brick,18
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,18
This other doth command a little door,18
There have I made my promise,18
To call upon him.,18
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:,18
In action all of precept he did show me,18
Are there no other tokens,18
No none but only a repair i' the dark;,18
Can be but brief; for I have made him know,18
That stays upon me whose persuasion is,18
Tis well borne up.,18
A word of this. What ho! within! come forth!,18
I pray you be acquainted with this maid;,18
I do desire the like.,18
Good friar I know you do and have found it.,18
Who hath a story ready for your ear.,18
The vaporous night approaches.,18
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA,18
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report,18
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit,18
And rack thee in their fancies.,18
Welcome how agreed?,18
If you advise it.,18
But my entreaty too.,18
When you depart from him but soft and low,18
Fear me not.,18
He is your husband on a pre-contract:,18
Sith that the justice of your title to him,18
Our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow.,18
SCENE II. A room in the prison.,18
Come hither sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?,18
married man he's his wife's head and I can never,18
Come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a,18
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common,18
you will take it on you to assist him it shall,18
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance,18
notorious bawd.,18
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I,18
fellow partner.,18
Enter ABHORSON,18
Sirrah here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in,18
him by the year and let him abide here with you; if,18
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.,18
Go to sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn,18
Exit,18
good favour you have but that you have a hanging,18
Ay sir; a mystery,18
your whores sir being members of my occupation,18
but what mystery there should be in hanging if I,18
Sir it is a mystery.,18
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be,18
big enough; if it be too big for your thief your,18
apparel fits your thief.,18
Are you agreed?,18
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth,18
You sirrah provide your block and your axe,18
Come on bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.,18
occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find,18
a good turn.,18
Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON,18
Being a murderer though he were my brother.,18
Look here's the warrant Claudio for thy death:,18
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?,18
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:,18
Who can do good on him?,18
Knocking within,18
Heaven give your spirits comfort!,18
By and by.,18
For the most gentle Claudio.,18
Welcome father.,18
Envelope you good Provost! Who call'd here of late?,18
Not Isabel?,18
They will then ere't be long.,18
There's some in hope.,18
Not so not so; his life is parallel'd,18
He doth with holy abstinence subdue,18
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that,18
But this being so he's just.,18
Now are they come.,18
This is a gentle provost: seldom when,18
Knocking within,18
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.,18
There he must stay until the officer,18
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,18
None sir none.,18
You shall hear more ere morning.,18
You something know; yet I believe there comes,18
Besides upon the very siege of justice,18
Profess'd the contrary.,18
This is his lordship's man.,18
[Giving a paper],18
further charge that you swerve not from the,18
other circumstance. Good morrow; for as I take it,18
I shall obey him.,18
[Aside]  This is his pardon purchased by such sin,18
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,18
When vice makes mercy mercy's so extended,18
Now sir what news?,18
in mine office awakens me with this unwonted,18
Pray you let's hear.,18
Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let,18
afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,18
this be duly performed; with a thought that more,18
not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril.',18
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the,18
A Bohemian born but here nursed un and bred; one,18
How came it that the absent duke had not either,18
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.,18
indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord,18
It is now apparent?,18
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how,18
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but,18
of what's past present or to come; insensible of,18
He wants advice.,18
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence he,18
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him as if,18
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.,18
provost honesty and constancy: if I read it not,18
boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard.,18
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath,18
manifested effect I crave but four days' respite;,18
dangerous courtesy.,18
In the delaying death.,18
and an express command under penalty to deliver,18
as Claudio's to cross this in the smallest.,18
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine,18
Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour.,18
Shave the head and tie the beard; and say it was,18
death: you know the course is common. If any thing,18
fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead,18
Pardon me good father; it is against my oath.,18
To him and to his substitutes.,18
avouch the justice of your dealing?,18
Not a resemblance but a certainty. Yet since I see,18
persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go,18
Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the,18
signet is not strange to you.,18
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you,18
shall find within these two days he will be here.,18
very day receives letters of strange tenor;,18
into some monastery; but by chance nothing of what,18
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these,18
when they are known. Call your executioner and off,18
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you,18
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.,18
SCENE III. Another room in the same.,18
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house,18
Overdone's own house for here be many of her old,18
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,18
five marks ready money: marry then ginger was not,18
Then is there here one Master Caper at the suit of,18
peach-coloured satin which now peaches him a,18
Master Deep-vow and Master Copperspur and Master,18
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding and Master,18
great traveller and wild Half-can that stabbed,18
our trade and are now 'for the Lord's sake.',18
Sirrah bring Barnardine hither.,18
Master Barnardine!,18
[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that,18
Your friends sir; the hangman. You must be so,18
[Within]  Away you rogue away! I am sleepy.,18
Pray Master Barnardine awake till you are,18
Go in to him and fetch him out.,18
Is the axe upon the block sirrah?,18
Enter BARNARDINE,18
Truly sir I would desire you to clap into your,18
You rogue I have been drinking all night; I am not,18
O the better sir; for he that drinks all night,18
sounder all the next day.,18
we jest now think you?,18
Sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily,18
you and pray with you.,18
and I will have more time to prepare me or they,18
consent to die this day that's certain.,18
Look forward on the journey you shall go.,18
persuasion.,18
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,18
Exit,18
After him fellows; bring him to the block.,18
Re-enter Provost,18
A creature unprepared unmeet for death;,18
Were damnable.,18
There died this morning of a cruel fever,18
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head,18
This reprobate till he were well inclined;,18
Of Ragozine more like to Claudio?,18
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on,18
And sent according to command; whiles I,18
This shall be done good father presently.,18
And how shall we continue Claudio,18
If he were known alive?,18
Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio:,18
To the under generation you shall find,18
I am your free dependant.,18
Exit Provost,18
The provost he shall bear them whose contents,18
And that by great injunctions I am bound,18
To meet me at the consecrated fount,18
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,18
Re-enter Provost,18
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;,18
That want no ear but yours.,18
Exit,18
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know,18
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,18
When it is least expected.,18
Ho by your leave!,18
The better given me by so holy a man.,18
He hath released him Isabel from the world:,18
Nay but it is not so.,18
In your close patience.,18
You shall not be admitted to his sight.,18
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!,18
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.,18
By every syllable a faithful verity:,18
One of our convent and his confessor,18
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,18
There to give up their power. If you can pace your wisdom,18
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,18
And general honour.,18
This letter then to Friar Peter give;,18
Say by this token I desire his company,18
I'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you,18
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,18
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:,18
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,18
Enter LUCIO,18
Not within sir.,18
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain,18
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set,18
to-morrow. By my troth Isabel I loved thy brother:,18
at home he had lived.,18
Sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your,18
Friar thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:,18
Well you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.,18
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.,18
they be true; if not true none were enough.,18
Did you such a thing?,18
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.,18
By my troth I'll go with thee to the lane's end:,18
it. Nay friar I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.,18
SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.,18
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.,18
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be,18
redeliver our authorities there,18
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his,18
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?,18
complaints and to deliver us from devices,18
against us.,18
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give,18
him.,18
Good night.,18
This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant,18
And by an eminent body that enforced,18
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,18
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,18
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,18
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,18
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!,18
Nothing goes right: we would and we would not.,18
SCENE V. Fields without the town.,18
These letters at fit time deliver me,18
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.,18
And hold you ever to our special drift;,18
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,18
To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus,18
But send me Flavius first.,18
Exit,18
I thank thee Varrius; thou hast made good haste:,18
Will greet us here anon my gentle Varrius.,18
SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.,18
To speak so indirectly I am loath:,18
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;,18
Be ruled by him.,18
He speak against me on the adverse side,18
That's bitter to sweet end.,18
O peace! the friar is come.,18
Come I have found you out a stand most fit,18
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;,18
Have hent the gates and very near upon,18
Exeunt,18
SCENE I. The city gate.,18
My very worthy cousin fairly met!,18
Happy return be to your royal grace!,18
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear,18
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,18
You make my bonds still greater.,18
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,18
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time,18
And let the subject see to make them know,18
Favours that keep within. Come Escalus,18
And good supporters are you.,18
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.,18
Upon a wrong'd I would fain have said a maid!,18
By throwing it on any other object,18
And given me justice justice justice justice!,18
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:,18
O worthy duke,18
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak,18
Or wring redress from you. Hear me O hear me here!,18
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,18
By course of justice!,18
Most strange but yet most truly will I speak:,18
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?,18
An hypocrite a virgin-violator;,18
Nay it is ten times strange.,18
Than this is all as true as it is strange:,18
To the end of reckoning.,18
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.,18
There is another comfort than this world,18
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible,18
But one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,18
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,18
Be an arch-villain; believe it royal prince:,18
Had I more name for badness.,18
If she be mad--as I believe no other--,18
Such a dependency of thing on thing,18
O gracious duke,18
For inequality; but let your reason serve,18
And hide the false seems true.,18
Have sure more lack of reason. What would you say?,18
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication,18
I in probation of a sisterhood,18
As then the messenger--,18
I came to her from Claudio and desired her,18
For her poor brother's pardon.,18
You were not bid to speak.,18
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.,18
Pray you take note of it: and when you have,18
Be perfect.,18
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.,18
Right.,18
To speak before your time. Proceed.,18
To this pernicious caitiff deputy--,18
Pardon it;,18
Mended again. The matter; proceed.,18
How I persuaded how I pray'd and kneel'd,18
For this was of much length--the vile conclusion,18
He would not but by gift of my chaste body,18
Release my brother; and after much debatement,18
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,18
For my poor brother's head.,18
O that it were as like as it is true!,18
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour,18
Stands without blemish. Next it imports no reason,18
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,18
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:,18
Thou camest here to complain.,18
Then O you blessed ministers above,18
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up,18
As I thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go!,18
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit,18
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.,18
One that I would were here Friar Lodowick.,18
My lord I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;,18
For certain words he spake against your grace,18
Words against me? this is a good friar belike!,18
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.,18
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,18
Blessed be your royal grace!,18
Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman,18
Who is as free from touch or soil with her,18
We did believe no less.,18
I know him for a man divine and holy;,18
As he's reported by this gentleman;,18
Did as he vouches misreport your grace.,18
Well he in time may come to clear himself;,18
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,18
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo came I hither,18
Is true and false; and what he with his oath,18
Whensoever he's convented. First for this woman.,18
So vulgarly and personally accused,18
Till she herself confess it.,18
ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward,18
O heaven the vanity of wretched fools!,18
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge,18
First let her show her face and after speak.,18
Until my husband bid me.,18
No my lord.,18
No my lord.,18
Neither my lord.,18
My lord she may be a punk; for many of them are,18
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause,18
Well my lord.,18
And I confess besides I am no maid:,18
Knows not that ever he knew me.,18
For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too!,18
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.,18
She that accuses him of fornication,18
And charges him my lord with such a time,18
With all the effect of love.,18
Not that I know.,18
Why just my lord and that is Angelo,18
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.,18
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.,18
This is that face thou cruel Angelo,18
This is the hand which with a vow'd contract,18
That took away the match from Isabel,18
In her imagined person.,18
Carnally she says.,18
Enough my lord.,18
And five years since there was some speech of marriage,18
Partly for that her promised proportions,18
For that her reputation was disvalued,18
I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her,18
Noble prince,18
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,18
As words could make up vows: and my good lord,18
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,18
Or else for ever be confixed here,18
I did but smile till now:,18
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive,18
But instruments of some more mightier member,18
To find this practise out.,18
And punish them to your height of pleasure.,18
Compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths,18
Were testimonies against his worth and credit,18
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains,18
There is another friar that set them on;,18
Would he were here my lord! for he indeed,18
Your provost knows the place where he abides,18
Go do it instantly.,18
And you my noble and well-warranted cousin,18
Do with your injuries as seems you best,18
But stir not you till you have well determined,18
My lord we'll do it throughly.,18
Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that,18
Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing,18
villanous speeches of the duke.,18
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a,18
As any in Vienna on my word.,18
Exit an Attendant,18
shall see how I'll handle her.,18
Say you?,18
she would sooner confess: perchance publicly,18
I will go darkly to work with her.,18
Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit,18
that you have said.,18
the provost.,18
call upon you.,18
Come sir: did you set these women on to slander,18
Tis false.,18
Respect to your great place! and let the devil,18
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.,18
Look you speak justly.,18
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?,18
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,18
And put your trial in the villain's mouth,18
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.,18
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women,18
And in the witness of his proper ear,18
To the duke himself to tax him with injustice?,18
Joint by joint but we will know his purpose.,18
Be not so hot; the duke,18
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,18
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,18
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,18
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,18
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!,18
Is this the man that you did tell us of?,18
do you know me?,18
met you at the prison in the absence of the duke.,18
Most notedly sir.,18
fool and a coward as you then reported him to be?,18
that my report: you indeed spoke so of him; and,18
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the,18
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.,18
treasonable abuses!,18
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him,18
speak no more. Away with those giglots too and,18
[To Provost]  Stay sir; stay awhile.,18
Come sir; come sir; come sir; foh sir! Why you,18
you? Show your knave's visage with a pox to you!,18
Will't not off?,18
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.,18
To LUCIO,18
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.,18
[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:,18
To ANGELO,18
Hast thou or word or wit or impudence,18
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,18
O my dread lord,18
To think I can be undiscernible,18
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then good prince,18
But let my trial be mine own confession:,18
Is all the grace I beg.,18
Say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?,18
Go take her hence and marry her instantly.,18
Return him here again. Go with him provost.,18
My lord I am more amazed at his dishonour,18
Come hither Isabel.,18
Advertising and holy to your business,18
Attorney'd at your service.,18
That I your vassal have employ'd and pain'd,18
You are pardon'd Isabel:,18
Your brother's death I know sits at your heart;,18
Labouring to save his life and would not rather,18
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,18
Which I did think with slower foot came on,18
That life is better life past fearing death,18
So happy is your brother.,18
Re-enter ANGELO MARIANA FRIAR PETER and Provost,18
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd,18
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother--,18
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,18
The very mercy of the law cries out,18
An Angelo for Claudio death for death!',18
Like doth quit like and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.,18
Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage.,18
Where Claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste.,18
O my most gracious lord,18
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.,18
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,18
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,18
We do instate and widow you withal,18
O my dear lord,18
Never crave him; we are definitive.,18
Kneeling,18
Away with him to death!,18
Now sir to you.,18
Lend me your knees and all my life to come,18
Against all sense you do importune her:,18
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,18
Isabel,18
Hold up your hands say nothing; I'll speak all.,18
And for the most become much more the better,18
O Isabel will you not lend a knee?,18
Most bounteous sir,18
Look if it please you on this man condemn'd,18
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,18
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,18
For Angelo,18
And must be buried but as an intent,18
Intents but merely thoughts.,18
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up I say.,18
Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded,18
It was commanded so.,18
No my good lord; it was by private message.,18
Give up your keys.,18
I thought it was a fault but knew it not;,18
For testimony whereof one in the prison,18
I have reserved alive.,18
His name is Barnardine.,18
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.,18
I am sorry one so learned and so wise,18
Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood.,18
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:,18
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;,18
Re-enter Provost with BARNARDINE CLAUDIO muffled and JULIET,18
This my lord.,18
Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul.,18
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:,18
And pray thee take this mercy to provide,18
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?,18
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;,18
Unmuffles CLAUDIO,18
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,18
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.,18
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.,18
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.,18
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.,18
You sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward,18
Wherein have I so deserved of you,18
Faith my lord. I spoke it but according to the,18
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.,18
Proclaim it provost round about the city.,18
As I have heard him swear himself there's one,18
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,18
I beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore.,18
good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.,18
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal,18
And see our pleasure herein executed.,18
whipping and hanging.,18
Exit Officers with LUCIO,18
Joy to you Mariana! Love her Angelo:,18
Thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness:,18
Thanks provost for thy care and secrecy:,18
Forgive him Angelo that brought you home,18
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,18
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,18
So bring us to our palace; where we'll show,18
Exeunt,18
SCENE I. Venice. A street.,19
In sooth I know not why I am so sad:,19
But how I caught it found it or came by it,19
I am to learn;,19
That I have much ado to know myself.,19
There where your argosies with portly sail,19
Or as it were the pageants of the sea,19
That curtsy to them do them reverence,19
Believe me sir had I such venture forth,19
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still,19
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;,19
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt,19
My wind cooling my broth,19
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.,19
But I should think of shallows and of flats,19
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs,19
And see the holy edifice of stone,19
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,19
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,19
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought,19
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?,19
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.,19
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,19
Upon the fortune of this present year:,19
Why then you are in love.,19
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,19
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,19
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:,19
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,19
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,19
Enter BASSANIO LORENZO and GRATIANO,19
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:,19
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,19
Your worth is very dear in my regard.,19
And you embrace the occasion to depart.,19
Good signiors both when shall we laugh? say when?,19
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.,19
My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio,19
I pray you have in mind where we must meet.,19
You look not well Signior Antonio;,19
They lose it that do buy it with much care:,19
I hold the world but as the world Gratiano;,19
And mine a sad one.,19
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,19
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.,19
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?,19
By being peevish? I tell thee what Antonio--,19
There are a sort of men whose visages,19
And do a wilful stillness entertain,19
Of wisdom gravity profound conceit,19
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!',19
That therefore only are reputed wise,19
If they should speak would almost damn those ears,19
I'll tell thee more of this another time:,19
For this fool gudgeon this opinion.,19
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.,19
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,19
Well keep me company but two years moe,19
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.,19
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.,19
Is that any thing now?,19
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two,19
shall seek all day ere you find them and when you,19
Well tell me now what lady is the same,19
That you to-day promised to tell me of?,19
How much I have disabled mine estate,19
Than my faint means would grant continuance:,19
From such a noble rate; but my chief care,19
Wherein my time something too prodigal,19
I owe the most in money and in love,19
To unburden all my plots and purposes,19
I pray you good Bassanio let me know it;,19
Within the eye of honour be assured,19
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.,19
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight,19
To find the other forth and by adventuring both,19
Because what follows is pure innocence.,19
That which I owe is lost; but if you please,19
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt,19
Or bring your latter hazard back again,19
You know me well and herein spend but time,19
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong,19
Than if you had made waste of all I have:,19
That in your knowledge may by me be done,19
In Belmont is a lady richly left;,19
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes,19
Her name is Portia nothing undervalued,19
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,19
Renowned suitors and her sunny locks,19
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,19
O my Antonio had I but the means,19
I have a mind presages me such thrift,19
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;,19
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;,19
That shall be rack'd even to the uttermost,19
Go presently inquire and so will I,19
To have it of my trust or for my sake.,19
SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of,19
You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in,19
yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit,19
is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the,19
competency lives longer.,19
They would be better if well followed.,19
do chapels had been churches and poor men's,19
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach,19
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may,19
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the,19
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to,19
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I,19
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,19
Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their,19
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,19
chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any,19
warmth is there in your affection towards any of,19
I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest,19
description level at my affection.,19
Ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but,19
appropriation to his own good parts that he can,19
mother played false with a smith.,19
He doth nothing but frown as who should say 'If you,19
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping,19
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be,19
than to either of these. God defend me from these,19
How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon?,19
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,19
Neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than,19
throstle sing he falls straight a capering: he will,19
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me,19
shall never requite him.,19
of England?,19
not me nor I him: he hath neither Latin French,19
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.,19
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!,19
hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his,19
What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour?,19
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and,19
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed,19
How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony's nephew?,19
most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when,19
when he is worst he is little better than a beast:,19
make shift to go without him.,19
casket you should refuse to perform your father's,19
Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a,19
for if the devil be within and that temptation,19
thing Nerissa ere I'll be married to a sponge.,19
lords: they have acquainted me with their,19
home and to trouble you with no more suit unless,19
imposition depending on the caskets.,19
chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner,19
are so reasonable for there is not one among them,19
them a fair departure.,19
Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither,19
Yes yes it was Bassanio; as I think he was so called.,19
eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady.,19
thy praise.,19
How now! what news?,19
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a,19
prince his master will be here to-night.,19
heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should,19
of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had,19
Nerissa. Sirrah go before.,19
upon one wooer another knocks at the door.,19
SCENE III. Venice. A public place.,19
Three thousand ducats; well.,19
For three months; well.,19
Antonio shall become bound; well.,19
know your answer?,19
Your answer to that.,19
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?,19
good man is to have you understand me that he is,19
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the,19
hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and,19
are but boards sailors but men: there be land-rats,19
mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters,19
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may,19
Be assured you may.,19
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?,19
Yes to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which,19
will buy with you sell with you talk with you,19
with you drink with you nor pray with you. What,19
Enter ANTONIO,19
[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!,19
But more for that in low simplicity,19
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.,19
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.,19
Even there where merchants most do congregate,19
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,19
Shylock do you hear?,19
And by the near guess of my memory,19
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?,19
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months,19
To ANTONIO,19
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.,19
By taking nor by giving of excess,19
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd,19
Ay ay three thousand ducats.,19
I had forgot; three months; you told me so.,19
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow,19
I do never use it.,19
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,19
The third possessor; ay he was the third--,19
No not take interest not as you would say,19
When Laban and himself were compromised,19
Should fall as Jacob's hire the ewes being rank,19
And when the work of generation was,19
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,19
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,19
Fall parti-colour'd lambs and those were Jacob's.,19
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.,19
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,19
Was this inserted to make interest good?,19
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:,19
Mark you this Bassanio,19
An evil soul producing holy witness,19
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:,19
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.,19
Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you?,19
In the Rialto you have rated me,19
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,19
You call me misbeliever cut-throat dog,19
And all for use of that which is mine own.,19
Go to then; you come to me and you say,19
You that did void your rheum upon my beard,19
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit,19
Hath a dog money? is it possible,19
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,19
Fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last;,19
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies,19
I am as like to call thee so again,19
If thou wilt lend this money lend it not,19
A breed for barren metal of his friend?,19
Who if he break thou mayst with better face,19
Why look you how you storm!,19
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,19
Of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me:,19
This were kindness.,19
Go with me to a notary seal me there,19
If you repay me not on such a day,19
Express'd in the condition let the forfeit,19
Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken,19
Content i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond,19
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:,19
Why fear not man; I will not forfeit it:,19
This bond expires I do expect return,19
O father Abram what these Christians are,19
The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this;,19
By the exaction of the forfeiture?,19
Is not so estimable profitable neither,19
To buy his favour I extend this friendship:,19
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.,19
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;,19
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,19
Of an unthrifty knave and presently,19
Hie thee gentle Jew.,19
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.,19
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;,19
Exeunt,19
SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
Mislike me not for my complexion,19
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.,19
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,19
To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine.,19
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear,19
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,19
In terms of choice I am not solely led,19
Besides the lottery of my destiny,19
But if my father had not scanted me,19
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,19
As any comer I have look'd on yet,19
Even for that I thank you:,19
To try my fortune. By this scimitar,19
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,19
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,19
Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey,19
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice,19
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:,19
And so may I blind fortune leading me,19
And die with grieving.,19
And either not attempt to choose at all,19
Never to speak to lady afterward,19
Nor will not. Come bring me unto my chance.,19
Your hazard shall be made.,19
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.,19
SCENE II. Venice. A street.,19
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from,19
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good,19
Gobbo use your legs take the start run away. My,19

heels.' Well the most courageous fiend bids me,19
fiend; 'for the heavens rouse up a brave mind',19
hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely,19
man's son' or rather an honest woman's son; for,19
grow to he had a kind of taste; well my conscience,19
fiend. 'Budge not' says my conscience.,19
say I 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my,19
who God bless the mark is a kind of devil; and to,19
fiend who saving your reverence is the devil,19
incarnal; and in my conscience my conscience is,19
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more,19
at your command; I will run.,19
Master young man you I pray you which is the way,19
[Aside]  O heavens this is my true-begotten father!,19

Pray you sir stand up: I am sure you are not,19
Pray you let's have no more fooling about it but,19

Her name is Margery indeed: I'll be sworn if thou,19
Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou,19
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.,19

Lord how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy,19

and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.,19
To him father.,19

He hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve--,19
and have a desire as my father shall specify--,19
are scarce cater-cousins--,19
done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I,19
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon,19
In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as,19
though I say it though old man yet poor man my father.,19
Serve you sir.,19

And hath preferr'd thee if it be preferment,19

widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one,19
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;,19
woman she's a good wench for this gear. Father,19
Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo,19
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,19
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee go.,19
Enter GRATIANO,19
Yonder sir he walks.,19
Signior Bassanio!,19
I have a suit to you.,19
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.,19
Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice;,19
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;,19
Something too liberal. Pray thee take pain,19
Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior,19
And lose my hopes.,19
If I do not put on a sober habit,19
Wear prayer-books in my pocket look demurely,19
Thus with my hat and sigh and say 'amen',19
Like one well studied in a sad ostent,19
Well we shall see your bearing.,19
By what we do to-night.,19
I would entreat you rather to put on,19
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:,19
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:,19
Exeunt,19
Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT,19
Our house is hell and thou a merry devil,19
But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee:,19
Lorenzo who is thy new master's guest:,19
And so farewell: I would not have my father,19
Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful,19
the knave and get thee I am much deceived. But,19
manly spirit: adieu.,19
Exit Launcelot,19
To be ashamed to be my father's child!,19
I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,19
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.,19
SCENE IV. The same. A street.,19
Nay we will slink away in supper-time,19
All in an hour.,19
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.,19
And better in my mind not undertook.,19
To furnish us.,19
Friend Launcelot what's the news?,19
this it shall seem to signify.,19
And whiter than the paper it writ on,19
Love-news in faith.,19
Whither goest thou?,19
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.,19
I will not fail her; speak it privately.,19
Exit Launcelot,19
I am provided of a torch-bearer.,19
And so will I.,19
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.,19
Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO,19
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed,19
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,19
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,19
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,19
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.,19
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.,19
SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.,19
Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge,19
What Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,19
And sleep and snore and rend apparel out;--,19
Why Jessica!,19
Your worship was wont to tell me that,19
Enter Jessica,19
I am bid forth to supper Jessica:,19
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:,19
The prodigal Christian. Jessica my girl,19
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,19
I beseech you sir go: my young master doth expect,19
So do I his.,19
shall see a masque; but if you do then it was not,19
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,19
year in the afternoon.,19
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum,19
Clamber not you up to the casements then,19
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,19
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter,19
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:,19
Say I will come.,19
window for all this There will come a Christian,19
Exit,19
His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.,19
Snail-slow in profit and he sleeps by day,19
Therefore I part with him and part with him,19
His borrow'd purse. Well Jessica go in;,19
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:,19
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.,19
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,19
Exit,19
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO masqued,19
Desired us to make stand.,19
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,19
O ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly,19
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!,19
With that keen appetite that he sits down?,19
His tedious measures with the unbated fire,19
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.,19
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,19
How like the prodigal doth she return,19
Lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!,19
Enter LORENZO,19
Not I but my affairs have made you wait:,19
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;,19
Enter JESSICA above in boy's clothes,19
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.,19
Lorenzo certain and my love indeed,19
But you Lorenzo whether I am yours?,19
Here catch this casket; it is worth the pains.,19
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:,19
The pretty follies that themselves commit;,19
To see me thus transformed to a boy.,19
What must I hold a candle to my shames?,19
Why 'tis an office of discovery love;,19
So are you sweet,19
But come at once;,19
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.,19
With some more ducats and be with you straight.,19
Now by my hood a Gentile and no Jew.,19
For she is wise if I can judge of her,19
And true she is as she hath proved herself,19
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.,19
What art thou come? On gentlemen; away!,19
Exit with Jessica and Salarino,19
Who's there?,19
Fie fie Gratiano! where are all the rest?,19
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;,19
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.,19
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.,19
SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
Go draw aside the curtains and discover,19
Now make your choice.,19
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;',19
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;',19
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.',19
The one of them contains my picture prince:,19
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;,19
What says this leaden casket?,19
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?,19
Do it in hope of fair advantages:,19
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.,19
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.',19
And weigh thy value with an even hand:,19
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough,19
And yet to be afeard of my deserving,19
As much as I deserve! Why that's the lady:,19
In graces and in qualities of breeding;,19
What if I stray'd no further but chose here?,19
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.',19
From the four corners of the earth they come,19
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds,19
For princes to come view fair Portia:,19
Spits in the face of heaven is no bar,19
As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.,19
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation,19
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.,19
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?,19
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England,19
Stamped in gold but that's insculp'd upon;,19
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:,19
There take it prince; and if my form lie there,19
He unlocks the golden casket,19
A carrion Death within whose empty eye,19
Reads,19
Often have you heard that told:,19
But my outside to behold:,19
Had you been as wise as bold,19
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:,19
Cold indeed; and labour lost:,19
Portia adieu. I have too grieved a heart,19
Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets,19
Let all of his complexion choose me so.,19
SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.,19
Why man I saw Bassanio under sail:,19
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.,19
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.,19
But there the duke was given to understand,19
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:,19
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.,19
So strange outrageous and so variable,19
My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!,19
Justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter!,19
Of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter!,19
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;,19
Why all the boys in Venice follow him,19
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,19
Marry well remember'd.,19
Who told me in the narrow seas that part,19
A vessel of our country richly fraught:,19
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.,19
Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him.,19
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:,19
Of his return: he answer'd 'Do not so;,19
But stay the very riping of the time;,19
Let it not enter in your mind of love:,19
To courtship and such fair ostents of love,19
And even there his eye being big with tears,19
And with affection wondrous sensible,19
I think he only loves the world for him.,19
And quicken his embraced heaviness,19
Do we so.,19
SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
Quick quick I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:,19
And comes to his election presently.,19
Behold there stand the caskets noble prince:,19
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:,19
You must be gone from hence immediately.,19
First never to unfold to any one,19
Of the right casket never in my life,19
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,19
To these injunctions every one doth swear,19
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now,19
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.',19
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:,19
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant,19
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;,19
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,19
I will not choose what many men desire,19
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.,19
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:,19
And well said too; for who shall go about,19
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume,19
O that estates degrees and offices,19
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!,19
How many be commanded that command!,19
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour,19
To be new-varnish'd! Well but to my choice:,19
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,19
He opens the silver casket,19
What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,19
How much unlike art thou to Portia!,19
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.',19
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?,19
And of opposed natures.,19
Reads,19
Seven times tried that judgment is,19
Some there be that shadows kiss;,19
There be fools alive I wis,19
Take what wife you will to bed,19
So be gone: you are sped.,19
By the time I linger here,19
But I go away with two.,19
Patiently to bear my wroth.,19
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.,19
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.,19
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.,19
Enter a Servant,19
Here: what would my lord?,19
A young Venetian one that comes before,19
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,19
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen,19
A day in April never came so sweet,19
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.,19
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,19
Come come Nerissa; for I long to see,19
Bassanio lord Love if thy will it be!,19
ACT III,19
Enter SALANIO and SALARINO,19
Why yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath,19
the Goodwins I think they call the place; a very,19
a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip,19
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever,19
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is,19
plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the,19
to keep his name company!--,19
Ha! what sayest thou? Why the end is he hath,19
I would it might prove the end of his losses.,19
prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.,19
How now Shylock! what news among the merchants?,19
daughter's flight.,19
that made the wings she flew withal.,19
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all,19
She is damned for it.,19
My own flesh and blood to rebel!,19
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.,19
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods,19
tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any,19
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt a,19
Rialto; a beggar that was used to come so smug upon,19
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was,19
look to his bond.,19
his flesh: what's that good for?,19
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and,19
mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my,19
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath,19
dimensions senses affections passions? fed with,19
to the same diseases healed by the same means,19
a Christian is? If you prick us do we not bleed?,19
us do we not die? and if you wrong us shall we not,19
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,19
wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by,19
teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I,19
Enter a Servant,19
desires to speak with you both.,19
Enter TUBAL,19
matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.,19
How now Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou,19
I often came where I did hear of her but cannot find her.,19
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse,19
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other,19
were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!,19
her coffin! No news of them? Why so: and I know,19
loss! the thief gone with so much and so much to,19
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my,19
but of my shedding.,19
heard in Genoa--,19
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.,19
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.,19
ha ha! where? in Genoa?,19
night fourscore ducats.,19
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!,19
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my,19
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture,19
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your,19
Out upon her! Thou torturest me Tubal: it was my,19
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.,19
Nay that's true that's very true. Go Tubal fee,19
will have the heart of him if he forfeit; for were,19
will. Go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue;,19
Exeunt,19
Enter BASSANIO PORTIA GRATIANO NERISSA and Attendants,19
Before you hazard; for in choosing wrong,19
There's something tells me but it is not love,19
Hate counsels not in such a quality.,19
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought--,19
Before you venture for me. I could teach you,19
So will I never be: so may you miss me;,19
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,19
One half of me is yours the other half yours,19
And so all yours. O these naughty times,19
And so though yours not yours. Prove it so,19
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,19
To stay you from election.,19
For as I am I live upon the rack.,19
What treason there is mingled with your love.,19
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:,19
Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.,19
Where men enforced do speak anything.,19
Well then confess and live.,19
Had been the very sum of my confession:,19
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!,19
Away then! I am lock'd in one of them:,19
Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof.,19
Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,19
May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream,19
And what is music then? Then music is,19
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is,19
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,19
With no less presence but with much more love,19
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy,19
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,19
The issue of the exploit. Go Hercules!,19
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.,19
SONG.,19
Or in the heart or in the head?,19
Reply reply.,19
With gazing fed; and fancy dies,19
Let us all ring fancy's knell,19
Ding dong bell.,19
The world is still deceived with ornament.,19
But being seasoned with a gracious voice,19
What damned error but some sober brow,19
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?,19
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:,19
As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins,19
Who inward search'd have livers white as milk;,19
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,19
Which therein works a miracle in nature,19
So are those crisped snaky golden locks,19
Upon supposed fairness often known,19
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.,19
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf,19
The seeming truth which cunning times put on,19
Hard food for Midas I will none of thee;,19
Tween man and man: but thou thou meagre lead,19
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;,19
[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,19
And shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy! O love,19
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.,19
For fear I surfeit.,19
Opening the leaden casket,19
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?,19
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,19
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs,19
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,19
How could he see to do them? having made one,19
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look how far,19
In underprizing it so far this shadow,19
The continent and summary of my fortune.,19
You that choose not by the view,19
Since this fortune falls to you,19
If you be well pleased with this,19
Turn you where your lady is,19
A gentle scroll. Fair lady by your leave;,19
Like one of two contending in a prize,19
Hearing applause and universal shout,19
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;,19
As doubtful whether what I see be true,19
You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand,19
I would not be ambitious in my wish,19
I would be trebled twenty times myself;,19
That only to stand high in your account,19
Exceed account; but the full sum of me,19
Is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractised;,19
But she may learn; happier than this,19
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit,19
As from her lord her governor her king.,19
Is now converted: but now I was the lord,19
Queen o'er myself: and even now but now,19
Are yours my lord: I give them with this ring;,19
Let it presage the ruin of your love,19
Madam you have bereft me of all words,19
And there is such confusion in my powers,19
By a beloved prince there doth appear,19
Where every something being blent together,19
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring,19
O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!,19
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,19
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,19
For I am sure you can wish none from me:,19
The bargain of your faith I do beseech you,19
With all my heart so thou canst get a wife.,19
My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours:,19
You loved I loved for intermission.,19
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,19
For wooing here until I sweat again,19
With oaths of love at last if promise last,19
To have her love provided that your fortune,19
Is this true Nerissa?,19
And do you Gratiano mean good faith?,19
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.,19
What and stake down?,19
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,19
Enter LORENZO JESSICA and SALERIO a Messenger from Venice,19
If that the youth of my new interest here,19
I bid my very friends and countrymen,19
So do I my lord:,19
I thank your honour. For my part my lord,19
But meeting with Salerio by the way,19
To come with him along.,19
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio,19
Gives Bassanio a letter,19
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.,19
Nor well unless in mind: his letter there,19
Nerissa cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.,19
How doth that royal merchant good Antonio?,19
We are the Jasons we have won the fleece.,19
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,19
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world,19
Of any constant man. What worse and worse!,19
And I must freely have the half of anything,19
O sweet Portia,19
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,19
I freely told you all the wealth I had,19
And then I told you true: and yet dear lady,19
How much I was a braggart. When I told you,19
That I was worse than nothing; for indeed,19
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,19
The paper as the body of my friend,19
Issuing life-blood. But is it true Salerio?,19
From Tripolis from Mexico and England,19
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch,19
Not one my lord.,19
The present money to discharge the Jew,19
A creature that did bear the shape of man,19
He plies the duke at morning and at night,19
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,19
Of greatest port have all persuaded with him;,19
Of forfeiture of justice and his bond.,19
To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen,19
Than twenty times the value of the sum,19
If law authority and power deny not,19
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?,19
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit,19
The ancient Roman honour more appears,19
What sum owes he the Jew?,19
What no more?,19
Double six thousand and then treble that,19
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.,19
And then away to Venice to your friend;,19
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold,19
When it is paid bring your true friend along.,19
Will live as maids and widows. Come away!,19
Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer:,19
But let me hear the letter of your friend.,19
miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is,19
in paying it it is impossible I should live all,19
see you at my death. Notwithstanding use your,19
let not my letter.,19
Since I have your good leave to go away,19
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,19
Exeunt,19
Enter SHYLOCK SALARINO ANTONIO and Gaoler,19
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:,19
Hear me yet good Shylock.,19
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.,19
But since I am a dog beware my fangs:,19
Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond,19
I pray thee hear me speak.,19
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.,19
To shake the head relent and sigh and yield,19
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.,19
It is the most impenetrable cur,19
Let him alone:,19
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:,19
Many that have at times made moan to me;,19
I am sure the duke,19
The duke cannot deny the course of law:,19
With us in Venice if it be denied,19
Since that the trade and profit of the city,19
These griefs and losses have so bated me,19
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.,19
To see me pay his debt and then I care not!,19
SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
Madam although I speak it in your presence,19
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly,19
But if you  knew to whom you show this honour,19
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,19
Than customary bounty can enforce you.,19
Nor shall not now: for in companions,19
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,19
Of lineaments of manners and of spirit;,19
Being the bosom lover of my lord,19
How little is the cost I have bestow'd,19
From out the state of hellish misery!,19
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.,19
The husbandry and manage of my house,19
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow,19
Only attended by Nerissa here,19
There is a monastery two miles off;,19
Not to deny this imposition;,19
Now lays upon you.,19
I shall obey you in all fair commands.,19
And will acknowledge you and Jessica,19
And so farewell till we shall meet again.,19
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.,19
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.,19
Now Balthasar,19
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,19
In speed to Padua: see thou render this,19
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,19
Unto the tranect to the common ferry,19
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.,19
Exit,19
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands,19
Shall they see us?,19
That they shall think we are accomplished,19
When we are both accoutred like young men,19
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,19
With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps,19
Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies,19
Which I denying they fell sick and died;,19
And wish for all that that I had not killed them;,19
That men shall swear I have discontinued school,19
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,19
Why shall we turn to men?,19
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!,19
When I am in my coach which stays for us,19
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.,19
SCENE V. The same. A garden.,19
Yes truly; for look you the sins of the father,19
promise ye I fear you. I was always plain with,19
therefore be of good cheer for truly I think you,19
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard,19
And what hope is that I pray thee?,19
not that you are not the Jew's daughter.,19
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.,19
mother: thus when I shun Scylla your father I,19
gone both ways.,19
Christian.,19
enow before; e'en as many as could well live one by,19
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters we,19
Enter LORENZO,19
I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if,19
Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo: Launcelot and I,19
me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter: and he,19
for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the,19
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than,19
Moor is with child by you Launcelot.,19
but if she be less than an honest woman she is,19
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the,19
and discourse grow commendable in none only but,19
That is done sir; they have all stomachs.,19
them prepare dinner.,19
Will you cover then sir?,19
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show,19
tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning:,19
in the meat and we will come in to dinner.,19
meat sir it shall be covered; for your coming in,19
conceits shall govern.,19
O dear discretion how his words are suited!,19
An army of good words; and I do know,19
Garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word,19
And now good sweet say thy opinion,19
Past all expressing. It is very meet,19
For having such a blessing in his lady,19
And if on earth he do not mean it then,19
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match,19
And Portia one there must be something else,19
Hath not her fellow.,19
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.,19
I will anon: first let us go to dinner.,19
No pray thee let it serve for table-talk;,19
I shall digest it.,19
Exeunt,19
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.,19
What is Antonio here?,19
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer,19
uncapable of pity void and empty,19
I have heard,19
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,19
Out of his envy's reach I do oppose,19
To suffer with a quietness of spirit,19
Go one and call the Jew into the court.,19
Enter SHYLOCK,19
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too,19
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought,19
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;,19
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,19
But touch'd with human gentleness and love,19
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,19
Enow to press a royal merchant down,19
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,19
To offices of tender courtesy.,19
I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;,19
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:,19
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.,19
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive,19
But say it is my humour: is it answer'd?,19
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats,19
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;,19
And others when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,19
Mistress of passion sways it to the mood,19
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,19
Why he a harmless necessary cat;,19
Must yield to such inevitable shame,19
So can I give no reason nor I will not,19
I bear Antonio that I follow thus,19
This is no answer thou unfeeling man,19
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.,19
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?,19
What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?,19
You may as well go stand upon the beach,19
You may as well use question with the wolf,19
You may as well forbid the mountain pines,19
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;,19
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--,19
Make no more offers use no farther means,19
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.,19
What judgment shall I dread doing,19
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.,19
What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong?,19
Which like your asses and your dogs and mules,19
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,19
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds,19
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer,19
The pound of flesh which I demand of him,19
If you deny me fie upon your law!,19
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?,19
Unless Bellario a learned doctor,19
Come here to-day.,19
A messenger with letters from the doctor,19
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.,19
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all,19
I am a tainted wether of the flock,19
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me,19
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.,19
Came you from Padua from Bellario?,19
Presenting a letter,19
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.,19
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,19
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?,19
O be thou damn'd inexecrable dog!,19
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith,19
That souls of animals infuse themselves,19
Govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter,19
And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,19
Are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous.,19
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:,19
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.,19
A young and learned doctor to our court.,19
He attendeth here hard by,19
With all my heart. Some three or four of you,19
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.,19
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of,19
your messenger came in loving visitation was with,19
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between,19
many books together: he is furnished with my,19
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes,19
request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of,19
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so,19
acceptance whose trial shall better publish his,19
You hear the learn'd Bellario what he writes:,19
Enter PORTIA dressed like a doctor of laws,19
I did my lord.,19
Are you acquainted with the difference,19
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.,19
Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth.,19
Shylock is my name.,19
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law,19
You stand within his danger do you not?,19
Do you confess the bond?,19
Then must the Jew be merciful.,19
The quality of mercy is not strain'd,19
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;,19
Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes,19
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,19
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;,19
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,19
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,19
Though justice be thy plea consider this,19
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;,19
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much,19
Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice,19
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,19
Is he not able to discharge the money?,19
Yea twice the sum: if that will not suffice,19
On forfeit of my hands my head my heart:,19
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,19
To do a great right do a little wrong,19
It must not be; there is no power in Venice,19
Twill be recorded for a precedent,19
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.,19
O wise young judge how I do honour thee!,19
Here 'tis most reverend doctor here it is.,19
An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven:,19
No not for Venice.,19
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim,19
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:,19
When it is paid according to the tenor.,19
You know the law your exposition,19
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,19
There is no power in the tongue of man,19
Most heartily I do beseech the court,19
Why then thus it is:,19
O noble judge! O excellent young man!,19
Hath full relation to the penalty,19
Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!,19
Therefore lay bare your bosom.,19
So says the bond: doth it not noble judge?,19
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh,19
I have them ready.,19
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.,19
It is not so express'd: but what of that?,19
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.,19
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.,19
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;,19
Than is her custom: it is still her use,19
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow,19
Of such misery doth she cut me off.,19
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;,19
And when the tale is told bid her be judge,19
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,19
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,19
Antonio I am married to a wife,19
But life itself my wife and all the world,19
I would lose all ay sacrifice them all,19
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,19
I have a wife whom I protest I love:,19
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.,19
The wish would make else an unquiet house.,19
Would any of the stock of Barrabas,19
Aside,19
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:,19
Most rightful judge!,19
The law allows it and the court awards it.,19
Tarry a little; there is something else.,19
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:',19
But in the cutting it if thou dost shed,19
Are by the laws of Venice confiscate,19
O upright judge! Mark Jew: O learned judge!,19
Thyself shalt see the act:,19
Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.,19
I take this offer then; pay the bond thrice,19
Here is the money.,19
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:,19
O Jew! an upright judge a learned judge!,19
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more,19
Or less than a just pound be it but so much,19
Or the division of the twentieth part,19
But in the estimation of a hair,19
A second Daniel a Daniel Jew!,19
Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.,19
I have it ready for thee; here it is.,19
He shall have merely justice and his bond.,19
I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word.,19
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,19
Why then the devil give him good of it!,19
Tarry Jew:,19
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,19
That by direct or indirect attempts,19
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive,19
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;,19
Of the duke only 'gainst all other voice.,19
For it appears by manifest proceeding,19
Thou hast contrived against the very life,19
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.,19
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:,19
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;,19
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,19
For half thy wealth it is Antonio's;,19
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.,19
Nay take my life and all; pardon not that:,19
That doth sustain my house; you take my life,19
What mercy can you render him Antonio?,19
So please my lord the duke and all the court,19
I am content; so he will let me have,19
Upon his death unto the gentleman,19
Two things provided more that for this favour,19
The other that he do record a gift,19
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.,19
The pardon that I late pronounced here.,19
I am content.,19
I pray you give me leave to go from hence;,19
And I will sign it.,19
In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:,19
To bring thee to the gallows not the font.,19
Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner.,19
I must away this night toward Padua,19
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.,19
For in my mind you are much bound to him.,19
Most worthy gentleman I and my friend,19
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,19
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.,19
In love and service to you evermore.,19
And I delivering you am satisfied,19
My mind was never yet more mercenary.,19
I wish you well and so I take my leave.,19
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,19
Not to deny me and to pardon me.,19
To ANTONIO,19
To BASSANIO,19
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;,19
This ring good sir alas it is a trifle!,19
I will have nothing else but only this;,19
There's more depends on this than on the value.,19
And find it out by proclamation:,19
I see sir you are liberal in offers,19
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.,19
And when she put it on she made me vow,19
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.,19
And know how well I have deserved the ring,19
For giving it to me. Well peace be with you!,19
My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring:,19
Be valued against your wife's commandment.,19
Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst,19
Exit Gratiano,19
And in the morning early will we both,19
Exeunt,19
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA,19
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night,19
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.,19
Fair sir you are well o'erta'en,19
Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat,19
That cannot be:,19
And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,19
That will I do.,19
Aside to PORTIA,19
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.,19
We shall have old swearing,19
But we'll outface them and outswear them too.,19
Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.,19
Exeunt,19
SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.,19
The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,19
And they did make no noise in such a night,19
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,19
In such a night,19
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,19
In such a night,19
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love,19
In such a night,19
That did renew old AEson.,19
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,19
As far as Belmont.,19
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,19
And ne'er a true one.,19
Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew,19
I would out-night you did no body come;,19
Enter STEPHANO,19
A friend.,19
Stephano is my name; and I bring word,19
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about,19
For happy wedlock hours.,19
None but a holy hermit and her maid.,19
He is not nor we have not heard from him.,19
And ceremoniously let us prepare,19
Enter LAUNCELOT,19
Who calls?,19
Master Lorenzo sola sola!,19
Sola! where? where?,19
Tell him there's a post come from my master with,19
ere morning.,19
Sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming.,19
My friend Stephano signify I pray you,19
And bring your music forth into the air.,19
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!,19
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night,19
Sit Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven,19
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st,19
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;,19
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay,19
Enter Musicians,19
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,19
Music,19
The reason is your spirits are attentive:,19
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,19
Which is the hot condition of their blood;,19
Or any air of music touch their ears,19
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,19
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods;,19
But music for the time doth change his nature.,19
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,19
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,19
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.,19
That light we see is burning in my hall.,19
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.,19
So doth the greater glory dim the less:,19
Unto the king be by and then his state,19
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!,19
Nothing is good I see without respect:,19
Silence bestows that virtue on it madam.,19
When neither is attended and I think,19
When every goose is cackling would be thought,19
How many things by season season'd are,19
Peace ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion,19
Music ceases,19
Or I am much deceived of Portia.,19
By the bad voice.,19
We have been praying for our husbands' healths,19
Are they return'd?,19
But there is come a messenger before,19
Go in Nerissa;,19
No note at all of our being absent hence;,19
A tucket sounds,19
We are no tell-tales madam; fear you not.,19
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,19
Enter BASSANIO ANTONIO GRATIANO and their followers,19
If you would walk in absence of the sun.,19
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,19
But God sort all! You are welcome home my lord.,19
This is the man this is Antonio,19
You should in all sense be much bound to him.,19
No more than I am well acquitted of.,19
It must appear in other ways than words,19
[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;,19
Would he were gelt that had it for my part,19
A quarrel ho already! what's the matter?,19
That she did give me whose posy was,19
Upon  a knife 'Love me and leave me not.',19
You swore to me when I did give it you,19
And that it should lie with you in your grave:,19
You should have been respective and have kept it.,19
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.,19
Ay if a woman live to be a man.,19
A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy,19
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee:,19
You were to blame I must be plain with you,19
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,19
I gave my love a ring and made him swear,19
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,19
That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,19
An 'twere to me I should be mad at it.,19
And swear I lost the ring defending it.,19
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed,19
That took some pains in writing he begg'd mine;,19
But the two rings.,19
Not that I hope which you received of me.,19
I would deny it; but you see my finger,19
Even so void is your false heart of truth.,19
Until I see the ring.,19
Till I again see mine.,19
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,19
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,19
When nought would be accepted but the ring,19
If you had known the virtue of the ring,19
Or your own honour to contain the ring,19
What man is there so much unreasonable,19
With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty,19
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:,19
No by my honour madam by my soul,19
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,19
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;,19
Of my dear friend. What should I say sweet lady?,19
I was beset with shame and courtesy;,19
So much besmear it. Pardon me good lady;,19
Had you been there I think you would have begg'd,19
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:,19
And that which you did swear to keep for me,19
I'll not deny him any thing I have,19
Know him I shall I am well sure of it:,19
If you do not if I be left alone,19
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.,19
How you do leave me to mine own protection.,19
For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen.,19
Sir grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.,19
And in the hearing of these many friends,19
Wherein I see myself--,19
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;,19
And there's an oath of credit.,19
Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear,19
I once did lend my body for his wealth;,19
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,19
Will never more break faith advisedly.,19
And bid him keep it better than the other.,19
By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor!,19
For by this ring the doctor lay with me.,19
For that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk,19
Why this is like the mending of highways,19
What are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?,19
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;,19
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,19
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,19
Enter'd my house. Antonio you are welcome;,19
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;,19
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:,19

Sweet doctor you shall be my bed-fellow:,19
Sweet lady you have given me life and living;,19
Are safely come to road.,19
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.,19
There do I give to you and Jessica,19
After his death of all he dies possess'd of.,19
Of starved people.,19
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied,19
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,19
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory,19
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,19
But were the day come I should wish it dark,19
Well while I live I'll fear no other thing,19

Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?,20
I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.,20
Well let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?,20

Word of denial: froth and scum thou liest!,20
Be avised sir and pass good humours: I will say,20

That you must. Will you upon good dowry marry her?,20
request cousin in any reason.,20

be no great love in the beginning yet heaven may,20
married and have more occasion to know one another;,20

serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.,20
O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?,20
He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?,20
thefts were too open; his filching was like an,20
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.,20
for the phrase!,20
Why then let kibes ensue.,20
Young ravens must have food.,20
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.,20
Two yards and more.,20
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about,20
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,20
can construe the action of her familiar style; and,20
rightly is 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.',20
out of honesty into English.,20
Now the report goes she has all the rule of her,20
As many devils entertain; and 'To her boy' say I.,20
I have writ me here a letter to her: and here,20
eyes too examined my parts with most judicious,20
foot sometimes my portly belly.,20
I thank thee for that humour.,20
greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did,20

With both the humours I:,20
And I to Ford shall eke unfold,20
His dove will prove his gold will hold,20
My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to,20

Yes indeed does he.,20

You jack'nape give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by,20

Troth sir all is in his hands above: but,20
book she loves you. Have not your worship a wart,20
Yes marry have I; what of that?,20

shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But,20
musing: but for you--well go to.,20
for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if,20
Will I? i'faith that we will; and I will tell your,20

Reads,20
Love use Reason for his physician he admits him,20
am I; go to then there's sympathy: you are merry,20
love sack and so do I; would you desire better,20
the least if the love of soldier can suffice--,20
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say love me. By me,20
By day or night,20
With all his might,20
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked,20
age to show himself a young gallant! What an,20
picked--with the devil's name!--out of my,20
Why he hath not been thrice in my company! What,20
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why I'll exhibit a bill,20
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,20
Enter MISTRESS FORD,20
And trust me I was coming to you. You look very,20
Nay I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.,20
Well I do then; yet I say I could show you to the,20
What's the matter woman?,20
could come to such honour!,20
it? dispense with trifles; what is it?,20
I could be knighted.,20
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the,20
We burn daylight: here read read; perceive how I,20
men as long as I have an eye to make difference of,20
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and,20
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to,20
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to,20
threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his,20
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him,20
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?,20
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery,20
letter: but let thine inherit first; for I,20
thousand of these letters writ with blank space for,20
second edition: he will print them out of doubt;,20
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,20
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.,20
words. What doth he think of us?,20
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain,20
for sure unless he know some strain in me that I,20
Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him,20
So will I if he come under my hatches I'll never,20
appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in,20
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.,20
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,20
eternal food to his jealousy.,20
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;,20
You are the happier woman.,20
Come hither.,20
Enter FORD with PISTOL and PAGE with NYM,20
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:,20

What name sir?,20
Take heed have open eye for thieves do foot by night:,20
Away Sir Corporal Nym!,20
Exit,20
[To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour,20
should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I,20
He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.,20
true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.,20
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.,20
The humour of it' quoth a'! here's a fellow,20
I will seek out Falstaff.,20
If I do find it: well.,20
o' the town commended him for a true man.,20
How now Meg!,20
Whither go you George? Hark you.,20

will you go Mistress Page?,20
Aside to MISTRESS FORD,20

You are come to see my daughter Anne?,20
Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with,20
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS QUICKLY,20
You heard what this knave told me did you not?,20
Do you think there is truth in them?,20
offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent,20
very rogues now they be out of service.,20
Marry were they.,20
the Garter?,20
towards my wife I would turn her loose to him; and,20
lie on my head.,20
turn them together. A man may be too confident: I,20
Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:,20
purse when he looks so merrily.,20
How now mine host!,20
Cavaleiro-justice I say!,20
I follow mine host I follow. Good even and,20
with us? we have sport in hand.,20
Sir there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh,20
Good mine host o' the Garter a word with you.,20
What sayest thou my bully-rook?,20
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;,20
for believe me I hear the parson is no jester.,20
They converse apart,20
guest-cavaleire?,20
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him,20
My hand bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;,20
a merry knight. Will you go An-heires?,20
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in,20
Tut sir I could have told you more. In these times,20
I know not what: 'tis the heart Master Page; 'tis,20
sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.,20
Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.,20
Though Page be a secure fool an stands so firmly,20
opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's,20
I will look further into't: and I have a disguise,20
my labour; if she be otherwise 'tis labour well bestowed.,20
SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn.,20
I will not lend thee a penny.,20
Which I with sword will open.,20
lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my,20
coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through,20
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were,20
Bridget lost the handle of her fan I took't upon,20
Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?,20
endanger my soul gratis? At a word hang no more,20
and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.,20
stand upon your honour! Why thou unconfinable,20
terms of my honour precise: I I I myself,20
and hiding mine honour in my necessity am fain to,20
will ensconce your rags your cat-a-mountain,20
bold-beating oaths under the shelter of your,20
I do relent: what would thou more of man?,20
Sir here's a woman would speak with you.,20
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY,20
Good morrow good wife.,20
Good maid then.,20
As my mother was the first hour I was born.,20
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?,20
the hearing.,20
little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master,20
Well on: Mistress Ford you say--,20
come a little nearer this ways.,20
own people.,20
Well Mistress Ford; what of her?,20
worship's a wanton! Well heaven forgive you and all,20
Mistress Ford; come Mistress Ford--,20
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis,20
court lay at Windsor could never have brought her,20
lords and gentlemen with their coaches I warrant,20
after gift; smelling so sweetly all musk and so,20
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of,20
woman's heart; and I warrant you they could never,20
given me this morning; but I defy all angels in,20
honesty: and I warrant you they could never get,20
them all: and yet there has been earls nay which,20
But what says she to me? be brief my good,20
Marry she hath received your letter for the which,20
to notify that her husband will be absence from his,20
Ten and eleven?,20
picture she says that you wot of: Master Ford,20
woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very,20
him good heart.,20
not fail her.,20
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty,20
your ear she's as fartuous a civil modest wife and,20
evening prayer as any is in Windsor whoe'er be the,20
husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there,20
a man: surely I think you have charms la; yes in truth.,20
good parts aside I have no other charms.,20
But I pray thee tell me this: has Ford's wife and,20
That were a jest indeed! they have not so little,20
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your,20
marvellous infection to the little page; and truly,20
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what,20
to bed when she list rise when she list all is as,20
be a kind woman in Windsor she is one. You must,20
Why I will.,20
go between you both; and in any case have a,20
the boy never need to understand any thing; for,20
wickedness: old folks you know have discretion,20
Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's,20
this woman.,20
This news distracts me!,20
Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:,20
Exit,20
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they,20
of so much money be now a gainer? Good body I,20
fairly done no matter.,20
Sir John there's one Master Brook below would fain,20
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.,20
Ay sir.,20
Exit BARDOLPH,20
liquor. Ah ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page,20
Re-enter BARDOLPH with FORD disguised,20
And you sir! Would you speak with me?,20
you.,20
Exit BARDOLPH,20
Good Master Brook I desire more acquaintance of you.,20
for I must let you understand I think myself in,20
hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned,20
ways do lie open.,20
Troth and I have a bag of money here troubles me:,20
half for easing me of the carriage.,20
I will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing.,20
your servant.,20
with you--and you have been a man long known to me,20
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a,20
own imperfection: but good Sir John as you have,20
turn another into the register of your own; that I,20
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.,20
There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's,20
Well sir.,20
bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting,20
fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly,20
to give her but have given largely to many to know,20
her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the,20
merited either in my mind or in my means meed,20
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite,20
Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;,20
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?,20
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?,20
Of what quality was your love then?,20
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place,20
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?,20
Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in,20
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now Sir,20
gentleman of excellent breeding admirable,20
place and person generally allowed for your many,20
O sir!,20
it spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only,20
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this,20
consent to you: if any man may you may as soon as,20
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your,20
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.,20
the excellency of her honour that the folly of my,20
be looked against. Now could I could come to her,20
instance and argument to commend themselves: I,20
her reputation her marriage-vow and a thousand,20
embattled against me. What say you to't Sir John?,20
money; next give me your hand; and last as I am a,20
O good sir!,20
Want no money Sir John; you shall want none.,20
none. I shall be with her I may tell you by her,20
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I,20
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband,20
know how I speed.,20
sir?,20
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the,20
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will,20
and there's my harvest-home.,20
if you saw him.,20

been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks,20
come; methinks his flesh is punished he shall have,20
So think I too.,20
And let us two devise to bring him thither.,20
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,20
Walk round about an oak with great ragg'd horns;,20
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain,20
You have heard of such a spirit and well you know,20
Received and did deliver to our age,20
Why yet there want not many that do fear,20
But what of this?,20
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.,20
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,20
That likewise have we thought upon and thus:,20
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress,20
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,20
As Falstaff she and I are newly met,20
With some diffused song: upon their sight,20
Then let them all encircle him about,20
And ask him why that hour of fairy revel,20
In shape profane.,20
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,20
The truth being known,20
And mock him home to Windsor.,20
Be practised well to this or they'll ne'er do't.,20
will be like a jack-an-apes also to burn the,20
That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.,20
Finely attired in a robe of white.,20
Aside,20
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,20
Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook,20
Fear not you that. Go get us properties,20
Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery,20
Exeunt PAGE FORD and SIR HUGH EVANS,20
Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind.,20
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,20
That Slender though well landed is an idiot;,20
The doctor is well money'd and his friends,20
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.,20
SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.,20
What wouldst thou have boor? what: thick-skin?,20
Marry sir I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff,20
There's his chamber his house his castle his,20

There was mine host an old fat woman even now with,20
Pray you sir was't not the wise woman of,20
Ay marry was it mussel-shell: what would you with her?,20

chain or no.,20
And what says she I pray sir?,20
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of,20
I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;,20

Ay come; quick.,20
Conceal them or thou diest.,20
Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to,20
Tis 'tis his fortune.,20
To have her or no. Go; say the woman told me so.,20
Ay sir; like who more bold.,20
with these tidings.,20
Thou art clerkly thou art clerkly Sir John. Was,20
Ay that there was mine host; one that hath taught,20
and I paid nothing for it neither but was paid for,20
Enter BARDOLPH,20
Where be my horses? speak well of them varletto.,20
beyond Eton they threw me off from behind one of,20
like three German devils three Doctor Faustuses.,20
say they be fled; Germans are honest men.,20
Where is mine host?,20
Have a care of your entertainments: there is a,20
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of,20
money. I tell you for good will look you: you,20
tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.,20
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS,20
Here master doctor in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.,20

Hue and cry villain go! Assist me knight. I am,20
Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH,20
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to,20
and how my transformation hath been washed and,20
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant,20
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered,20
wind were but long enough to say my prayers I would repent.,20
Now whence come you?,20

And have not they suffered? Yes I warrant;,20

And as I am a gentleman I'll give thee,20
I will hear you Master Fenton; and I will at the,20
From time to time I have acquainted you,20
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,20
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her,20
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,20
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff,20
I'll show you here at large. Hark good mine host.,20
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;,20
While other jests are something rank on foot,20
Away with Slender and with him at Eton,20
Her mother ever strong against that match,20
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,20
And at the deanery where a priest attends,20
She seemingly obedient likewise hath,20
Her father means she shall be all in white,20
To take her by the hand and bid her go,20
The better to denote her to the doctor,20
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,20
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,20
The maid hath given consent to go with him.,20
Both my good host to go along with me:,20
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,20
To give our hearts united ceremony.,20
Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest.,20
Besides I'll make a present recompense.,20

odd numbers either in nativity chance or death. Away!,20

Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY,20
How now Master Brook! Master Brook the matter,20
Park about midnight at Herne's oak and you shall,20
Went you not to her yesterday sir as you told me,20
I went to her Master Brook as you see like a poor,20
poor old woman. That same knave Ford her husband,20
Master Brook that ever governed frenzy. I will tell,20
woman; for in the shape of man Master Brook I fear,20
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along,20

Ay forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a,20

That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum',20
enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.,20
well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil,20
Let's away; follow me.,20
SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.,20
Master doctor my daughter is in green: when you,20

I know vat I have to do. Adieu.,20
Exit DOCTOR CAIUS,20

If he be not amazed he will be mocked; if he be,20

Those that betray them do no treachery.,20
Exeunt,20

Remember Jove thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love,20
respects makes a beast a man in some other a man,20
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew,20
the form of a beast. O Jove a beastly fault! And,20

Alas what noise?,20
What should this be?,20
They run off,20

Enter SIR HUGH EVANS disguised as before; PISTOL  as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY ANNE PAGE and others as Fairies with tapers,20
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,20
Attend your office and your quality.,20
Elves list your names; silence you airy toys.,20
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,20
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.,20
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.,20
Where's Bede? Go you and where you find a maid,20
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;,20
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,20
About about;,20
Strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room:,20
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,20
The several chairs of order look you scour,20
Each fair instalment coat and several crest,20
And nightly meadow-fairies look you sing,20
The expressure that it bears green let it be,20
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write,20
Let sapphire pearl and rich embroidery,20
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.,20
Our dance of custom round about the oak,20
Pray you lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set,20
To guide our measure round about the tree.,20
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he,20
Vile worm thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.,20
If he be chaste the flame will back descend,20
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.,20
Come will this wood take fire?,20
Oh Oh Oh!,20
About him fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;,20
SONG.,20
Fie on lust and luxury!,20
Kindled with unchaste desire,20
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher.,20
Pinch him for his villany;,20
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.,20
Enter PAGE FORD MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD,20
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?,20
Now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives?,20
Become the forest better than the town?,20
Falstaff's a knave a cuckoldly knave; here are his,20

paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for,20
Sir John we have had ill luck; we could never meet.,20
always count you my deer.,20
Ay and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.,20
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet,20
powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a,20
rhyme and reason that they were fairies. See now,20
ill employment!,20
desires and fairies will not pinse you.,20
And leave your jealousies too I pray you.,20
able to woo her in good English.,20
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as,20
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked,20
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.,20
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This,20

will be a biting affliction.,20
to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to,20
Master Slender hath married her daughter.,20
daughter she is by this Doctor Caius' wife.,20
Whoa ho! ho father Page!,20
Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire,20
Of what son?,20
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been,20
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had,20
a postmaster's boy.,20
What need you tell me that? I think so when I took,20
all he was in woman's apparel I would not have had,20
Why this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how,20
I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she,20
it was not Anne but a postmaster's boy.,20
turned my daughter into green; and indeed she is,20
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS,20
married un garcon a boy; un paysan by gar a boy;,20
Why did you take her in green?,20
Exit,20
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.,20
How now Master Fenton!,20
Now mistress how chance you went not with Master Slender?,20
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.,20
Where there was no proportion held in love.,20
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.,20
And this deceit loses the name of craft,20
Since therein she doth evitate and shun,20
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.,20
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;,20
I am glad though you have ta'en a special stand to,20
Well what remedy? Fenton heaven give thee joy!,20
When night-dogs run all sorts of deer are chased.,20
Heaven give you many many merry days!,20
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;,20
Let it be so. Sir John,20
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.,20
ACT I,21
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE and Attendants,21
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in,21
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,21
Long withering out a young man revenue.,21
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;,21
New-bent in heaven shall behold the night,21
Go Philostrate,21
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;,21
The pale companion is not for our pomp.,21
Hippolyta I woo'd thee with my sword,21
But I will wed thee in another key,21
Enter EGEUS HERMIA LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS,21
Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee?,21
Against my child my daughter Hermia.,21
This man hath my consent to marry her.,21
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;,21
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:,21
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,21
With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits,21
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:,21
Turn'd her obedience which is due to me,21
Be it so she; will not here before your grace,21
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,21
Which shall be either to this gentleman,21
Immediately provided in that case.,21
To you your father should be as a god;,21
To whom you are but as a form in wax,21
To leave the figure or disfigure it.,21
So is Lysander.,21
But in this kind wanting your father's voice,21
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.,21
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.,21
Nor how it may concern my modesty,21
But I beseech your grace that I may know,21
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.,21
For ever the society of men.,21
Know of your youth examine well your blood,21
You can endure the livery of a nun,21
To live a barren sister all your life,21
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,21
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,21
Grows lives and dies in single blessedness.,21
Ere I will my virgin patent up,21
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.,21
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,21
Upon that day either prepare to die,21
Or else to wed Demetrius as he would;,21
For aye austerity and single life.,21
Thy crazed title to my certain right.,21
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.,21
And what is mine my love shall render him.,21
I do estate unto Demetrius.,21
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;,21
If not with vantage as Demetrius';,21
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:,21
Demetrius I'll avouch it to his head,21
And won her soul; and she sweet lady dotes,21
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.,21
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;,21
My mind did lose it. But Demetrius come;,21
I have some private schooling for you both.,21
To fit your fancies to your father's will;,21
Which by no means we may extenuate--,21
Come my Hippolyta: what cheer my love?,21
I must employ you in some business,21
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.,21
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA,21
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?,21
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.,21
Could ever hear by tale or history,21
But either it was different in blood--,21
Or else misgraffed in respect of years--,21
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends--,21
Or if there were a sympathy in choice,21
Making it momentany as a sound,21
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,21
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!',21
So quick bright things come to confusion.,21
It stands as an edict in destiny:,21
Because it is a customary cross,21
Wishes and tears poor fancy's followers.,21
I have a widow aunt a dowager,21
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;,21
There gentle Hermia may I marry thee;,21
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,21
And in the wood a league without the town,21
To do observance to a morn of May,21
My good Lysander!,21
By his best arrow with the golden head,21
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,21
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,21
In number more than ever women spoke,21
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.,21
Enter HELENA,21
Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.,21
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air,21
When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear.,21
Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go;,21
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.,21
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.,21
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.,21
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!,21
O that my prayers could such affection move!,21
The more I love the more he hateth me.,21
None but your beauty: would that fault were mine!,21
Lysander and myself will fly this place.,21
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:,21
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!,21
To-morrow night when Phoebe doth behold,21
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,21
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.,21
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,21
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;,21
To seek new friends and stranger companies.,21
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!,21
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.,21
Exit HERMIA,21
As you on him Demetrius dote on you!,21
How happy some o'er other some can be!,21
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;,21
And as he errs doting on Hermia's eyes,21
Things base and vile folding no quantity,21
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;,21
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;,21
And therefore is Love said to be a child,21
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,21
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,21
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,21
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:,21
Pursue her; and for this intelligence,21
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,21
Exit,21
Enter QUINCE SNUG BOTTOM FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING,21
You were best to call them generally man by man,21
Here is the scroll of every man's name which is,21
interlude before the duke and the duchess on his,21
First good Peter Quince say what the play treats,21
to a point.,21
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.,21
merry. Now good Peter Quince call forth your,21
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver.,21
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus.,21
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.,21
it: if I do it let the audience look to their,21
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a,21
tear a cat in to make all split.,21
And shivering shocks,21
Of prison gates;,21
Shall shine from far,21
The foolish Fates.,21
This is Ercles' vein a tyrant's vein; a lover is,21
Francis Flute the bellows-mender.,21
Flute you must take Thisby on you.,21
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.,21
That's all one: you shall play it in a mask and,21
An I may hide my face let me play Thisby too I'll,21
Thisne;' 'Ah Pyramus lover dear! thy Thisby dear,21
No no; you must play Pyramus: and Flute you Thisby.,21
Robin Starveling the tailor.,21
Robin Starveling you must play Thisby's mother.,21
Here Peter Quince.,21
Snug the joiner; you the lion's part: and I,21
Have you the lion's part written? pray you if it,21
You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring.,21
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,21
let him roar again.',21
the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek;,21
That would hang us every mother's son.,21
ladies out of their wits they would have no more,21
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any,21
nightingale.,21
sweet-faced man; a proper man as one shall see in a,21
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.,21
to play it in?,21
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour,21
beard or your French-crown-colour beard your,21
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and,21
are your parts: and I am to entreat you request,21
and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the,21
we meet in the city we shall be dogged with,21
will draw a bill of properties such as our play,21
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most,21
At the duke's oak we meet.,21
Exeunt,21
SCENE I. A wood near Athens.,21
How now spirit! whither wander you?,21
Thorough bush thorough brier,21
Thorough flood thorough fire,21
Swifter than the moon's sphere;,21
To dew her orbs upon the green.,21
In their gold coats spots you see;,21
In those freckles live their savours:,21
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.,21
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.,21
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;,21
Because that she as her attendant hath,21
She never had so sweet a changeling;,21
Knight of his train to trace the forests wild;,21
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:,21
By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,21
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.,21
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite,21
That frights the maidens of the villagery;,21
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;,21
Mislead night-wanderers laughing at their harm?,21
You do their work and they shall have good luck:,21
Thou speak'st aright;,21
I jest to Oberon and make him smile,21
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:,21
In very likeness of a roasted crab,21
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.,21
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;,21
And 'tailor' cries and falls into a cough;,21
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear,21
But room fairy! here comes Oberon.,21
Enter from one side OBERON with his train; from the other TITANIA with hers,21
What jealous Oberon! Fairies skip hence:,21
Tarry rash wanton: am not I thy lord?,21
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,21
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love,21
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?,21
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,21
To give their bed joy and prosperity.,21
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,21
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night,21
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,21
These are the forgeries of jealousy:,21
Met we on hill in dale forest or mead,21
Or in the beached margent of the sea,21
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.,21
As in revenge have suck'd up from the sea,21
Have every pelting river made so proud,21
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,21
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;,21
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;,21
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,21
The human mortals want their winter here;,21
Therefore the moon the governess of floods,21
That rheumatic diseases do abound:,21
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts,21
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown,21
Is as in mockery set: the spring the summer,21
Their wonted liveries and the mazed world,21
And this same progeny of evils comes,21
We are their parents and original.,21
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?,21
To be my henchman.,21
The fairy land buys not the child of me.,21
And in the spiced Indian air by night,21
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,21
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,21
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait,21
Would imitate and sail upon the land,21
As from a voyage rich with merchandise.,21
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,21
How long within this wood intend you stay?,21
If you will patiently dance in our round,21
If not shun me and I will spare your haunts.,21
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies away!,21
Exit TITANIA with her train,21
Till I torment thee for this injury.,21
Since once I sat upon a promontory,21
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,21
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,21
I remember.,21
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,21
At a fair vestal throned by the west,21
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;,21
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,21
In maiden meditation fancy-free.,21
It fell upon a little western flower,21
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.,21
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid,21
Upon the next live creature that it sees.,21
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.,21
In forty minutes.,21
Having once this juice,21
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.,21
Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull,21
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:,21
As I can take it with another herb,21
But who comes here? I am invisible;,21
Enter DEMETRIUS HELENA following him,21
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?,21
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;,21
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.,21
You draw me you hard-hearted adamant;,21
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,21
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?,21
Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?,21
I am your spaniel; and Demetrius,21
Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me,21
Unworthy as I am to follow you.,21
And yet a place of high respect with me--,21
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;,21
And I am sick when I look not on you.,21
To leave the city and commit yourself,21
To trust the opportunity of night,21
With the rich worth of your virginity.,21
It is not night when I do see your face,21
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,21
Then how can it be said I am alone,21
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,21
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.,21
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;,21
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,21
I will not stay thy questions; let me go:,21
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.,21
You do me mischief. Fie Demetrius!,21
We cannot fight for love as men may do;,21
Exit DEMETRIUS,21
To die upon the hand I love so well.,21
Fare thee well nymph: ere he do leave this grove,21
Re-enter PUCK,21
Ay there it is.,21
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,21
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,21
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,21
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,21
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,21
Take thou some of it and seek through this grove:,21
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;,21
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man,21
Effect it with some care that he may prove,21
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.,21
Exeunt,21
Enter TITANIA with her train,21
Then for the third part of a minute hence;,21
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,21
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders,21
Then to your offices and let me rest.,21
You spotted snakes with double tongue,21
Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,21
Philomel with melody,21
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby:,21
Nor spell nor charm,21
So good night with lullaby.,21
Hence you long-legg'd spinners hence!,21
Worm nor snail do no offence.,21
Hence away! now all is well:,21
Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps,21
What thou seest when thou dost wake,21
Love and languish for his sake:,21
Pard or boar with bristled hair,21
When thou wakest it is thy dear:,21
Exit,21
Fair love you faint with wandering in the wood;,21
We'll rest us Hermia if you think it good,21
Be it so Lysander: find you out a bed;,21
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;,21
Nay good Lysander; for my sake my dear,21
O take the sense sweet of my innocence!,21
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,21
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;,21
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;,21
Lysander riddles very prettily:,21
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.,21
Lie further off; in human modesty,21
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,21
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!,21
And then end life when I end loyalty!,21
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!,21
Enter PUCK,21
But Athenian found I none,21
This flower's force in stirring love.,21
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:,21
Despised the Athenian maid;,21
On the dank and dirty ground.,21
Near this lack-love this kill-courtesy.,21
All the power this charm doth owe.,21
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:,21
For I must now to Oberon.,21
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA running,21
I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus.,21
Stay on thy peril: I alone will go.,21
O I am out of breath in this fond chase!,21
Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies;,21
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:,21
No no I am as ugly as a bear;,21
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius,21
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine,21
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!,21
Lysander if you live good sir awake.,21
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,21
Where is Demetrius? O how fit a word,21
Do not say so Lysander; say not so,21
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.,21
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.,21
Who will not change a raven for a dove?,21
And reason says you are the worthier maid.,21
So I being young till now ripe not to reason;,21
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,21
Love's stories written in love's richest book.,21
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?,21
That I did never no nor never can,21
But you must flout my insufficiency?,21
In such disdainful manner me to woo.,21
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.,21
Should of another therefore be abused!,21
She sees not Hermia. Hermia sleep thou there:,21
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things,21
Or as tie heresies that men do leave,21
So thou my surfeit and my heresy,21
And all my powers address your love and might,21
Exit,21
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!,21
Lysander look how I do quake with fear:,21
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.,21
What out of hearing? gone? no sound no word?,21
Speak of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.,21
Either death or you I'll find immediately.,21
ACT III,21
Enter QUINCE SNUG BOTTOM FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING,21
Pat pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place,21
stage this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we,21
Peter Quince--,21
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and,21
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies,21
By'r lakin a parlous fear.,21
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.,21
say we will do no harm with our swords and that,21
better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not,21
out of fear.,21
written in eight and six.,21
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?,21
Masters you ought to consider with yourselves: to,21
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful,21
look to 't.,21
Nay you must name his name and half his face must,21
must speak through saying thus or to the same,21
You'--or 'I would request you'--or 'I would,21
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion it,21
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name,21
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;,21
you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.,21
A calendar a calendar! look in the almanac; find,21
Yes it doth shine that night.,21
chamber window where we play open and the moon,21
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns,21
present the person of Moonshine. Then there is,21
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did,21
You can never bring in a wall. What say you Bottom?,21
have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast,21
fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus,21
If that may be then all is well. Come sit  down,21
Pyramus you begin: when you have spoken your,21
according to his cue.,21
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,21
What a play toward! I'll be an auditor;,21
Speak Pyramus. Thisby stand forth.,21
Odours odours.,21
So hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear.,21
And by and by I will to thee appear.,21
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.,21
Must I speak now?,21
but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again.,21
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,21
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,21
Ninus' tomb' man: why you must not speak that,21
part at once cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue,21
O--As true as truest horse that yet would,21
Re-enter PUCK and BOTTOM with an ass's head,21
O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,21
Exeunt QUINCE SNUG FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING,21
Through bog through bush through brake through brier:,21
A hog a headless bear sometime a fire;,21
Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn.,21
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to,21
Re-enter SNOUT,21
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own do,21
Exit SNOUT,21
Bless thee Bottom! bless thee! thou art,21
Exit,21
to fright me if they could. But I will not stir,21
and down here and I will sing that they shall hear,21
Sings,21
With orange-tawny bill,21
The wren with little quill--,21
[Sings],21
The plain-song cuckoo gray,21
And dares not answer nay;--,21
a bird? who would give a bird the lie though he cry,21
I pray thee gentle mortal sing again:,21
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;,21
On the first view to say to swear I love thee.,21
for that: and yet to say the truth reason and,21
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not,21
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.,21
of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn.,21
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.,21
The summer still doth tend upon my state;,21
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,21
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;,21
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.,21
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM COBWEB MOTH and MUSTARDSEED,21
And I.,21
And I.,21
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;,21
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,21
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,21
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,21
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies,21
Nod to him elves and do him courtesies.,21
Hail!,21
Hail!,21
worship's name.,21
I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master,21
you. Your name honest gentleman?,21
I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your,21
Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more,21
Mustardseed.,21
that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath,21
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I,21
Mustardseed.,21
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;,21
Lamenting some enforced chastity.,21
Exeunt,21
Enter OBERON,21
Then what it was that next came in her eye,21
Enter PUCK,21
How now mad spirit!,21
My mistress with a monster is in love.,21
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,21
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,21
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.,21
Who Pyramus presented in their sport,21
When I did him at this advantage take,21
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,21
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,21
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,21
So at his sight away his fellows fly;,21
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.,21
thus strong,21
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;,21
things catch.,21
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:,21
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.,21
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes,21
I took him sleeping--that is finish'd too--,21
That when he waked of force she must be eyed.,21
Stand close: this is the same Athenian.,21
O why rebuke you him that loves you so?,21
Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,21
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,21
And kill me too.,21
As he to me: would he have stolen away,21
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon,21
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.,21
So should a murderer look so dead so grim.,21
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:,21
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.,21
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me?,21
Out dog! out cur! thou drivest me past the bounds,21
Henceforth be never number'd among men!,21
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,21
Could not a worm an adder do so much?,21
Than thine thou serpent never adder stung.,21
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;,21
I pray thee tell me then that he is well.,21
A privilege never to see me more.,21
See me no more whether he be dead or no.,21
There is no following her in this fierce vein:,21
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow,21
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,21
Lies down and sleeps,21
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:,21
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.,21
A million fail confounding oath on oath.,21
And Helena of Athens look thou find:,21
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear:,21
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.,21
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.,21
Flower of this purple dye,21
Sink in apple of his eye.,21
Let her shine as gloriously,21
When thou wakest if she be by,21
Re-enter PUCK,21
Helena is here at hand;,21
Pleading for a lover's fee.,21
Lord what fools these mortals be!,21
Will cause Demetrius to awake.,21
That must needs be sport alone;,21
That befal preposterously.,21
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?,21
Look when I vow I weep; and vows so born,21
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,21
You do advance your cunning more and more.,21
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?,21
Your vows to her and me put in two scales,21
I had no judgment when to her I swore.,21
Demetrius loves her and he loves not you.,21
To what my love shall I compare thine eyne?,21
Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow!,21
Fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow,21
This princess of pure white this seal of bliss!,21
To set against me for your merriment:,21
You would not do me thus much injury.,21
But you must join in souls to mock me too?,21
You would not use a gentle lady so;,21
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.,21
And now both rivals to mock Helena:,21
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes,21
Would so offend a virgin and extort,21
You are unkind Demetrius; be not so;,21
And here with all good will with all my heart,21
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,21
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.,21
If e'er I loved her all that love is gone.,21
And now to Helen is it home return'd,21
Helen it is not so.,21
Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.,21
Re-enter HERMIA,21
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;,21
It pays the hearing double recompense.,21
Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound,21
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?,21
Lysander's love that would not let him bide,21
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.,21
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?,21
Lo she is one of this confederacy!,21
To fashion this false sport in spite of me.,21
Have you conspired have you with these contrived,21
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,21
When we have chid the hasty-footed time,21
All school-days' friendship childhood innocence?,21
Have with our needles created both one flower,21
Both warbling of one song both in one key,21
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,21
But yet an union in partition;,21
So with two seeming bodies but one heart;,21
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.,21
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?,21
Our sex as well as I may chide you for it,21
I am amazed at your passionate words.,21
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn,21
And made your other love Demetrius,21
To call me goddess nymph divine and rare,21
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander,21
And tender me forsooth affection,21
What thought I be not so in grace as you,21
But miserable most to love unloved?,21
I understand not what you mean by this.,21
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;,21
This sport well carried shall be chronicled.,21
You would not make me such an argument.,21
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.,21
My love my life my soul fair Helena!,21
Sweet do not scorn her so.,21
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:,21
Helen I love thee; by my life I do:,21
To prove him false that says I love thee not.,21
If thou say so withdraw and prove it too.,21
Lysander whereto tends all this?,21
No no; he'll [        ],21
But yet come not: you are a tame man go!,21
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!,21
Sweet love--,21
Out loathed medicine! hated potion hence!,21
Yes sooth; and so do you.,21
I would I had your bond for I perceive,21
What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead?,21
What can you do me greater harm than hate?,21
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?,21
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left,21
Why then you left me--O the gods forbid!--,21
Ay by my life;,21
Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt;,21
That I do hate thee and love Helena.,21
You thief of love! what have you come by night,21
Fine i'faith!,21
No touch of bashfulness? What will you tear,21
Fie fie! you counterfeit you puppet you!,21
Now I perceive that she hath made compare,21
And with her personage her tall personage,21
And are you grown so high in his esteem;,21
How low am I thou painted maypole? speak;,21
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.,21
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;,21
I am a right maid for my cowardice:,21
Because she is something lower than myself,21
Lower! hark again.,21
I evermore did love you Hermia,21
Save that in love unto Demetrius,21
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;,21
To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too:,21
To Athens will I bear my folly back,21
You see how simple and how fond I am.,21
A foolish heart that I leave here behind.,21
With Demetrius.,21
No sir she shall not though you take her part.,21
She was a vixen when she went to school;,21
Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!,21
Let me come to her.,21
You minimus of hindering knot-grass made;,21
You are too officious,21
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;,21
Never so little show of love to her,21
Now she holds me not;,21
Of thine or mine is most in Helena.,21
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS,21
Nay go not back.,21
Nor longer stay in your curst company.,21
My legs are longer though to run away.,21
I am amazed and know not what to say.,21
This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,21
Believe me king of shadows I mistook.,21
By the Athenian garment be had on?,21
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;,21
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.,21
Hie therefore Robin overcast the night;,21
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,21
As one come not within another's way.,21
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;,21
And from each other look thou lead them thus,21
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:,21
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,21
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.,21
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,21
With league whose date till death shall never end.,21
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;,21
From monster's view and all things shall be peace.,21
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,21
At whose approach ghosts wandering here and there,21
That in crossways and floods have burial,21
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,21
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.,21
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,21
Even till the eastern gate all fiery-red,21
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.,21
We may effect this business yet ere day.,21
Up and down up and down,21
I am fear'd in field and town:,21
Here comes one.,21
Where art thou proud Demetrius? speak thou now.,21
I will be with thee straight.,21
To plainer ground.,21
Re-enter DEMETRIUS,21
Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled?,21
Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars,21
And wilt not come? Come recreant; come thou child;,21
That draws a sword on thee.,21
Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.,21
Re-enter LYSANDER,21
When I come where he calls then he is gone.,21
I follow'd fast but faster he did fly;,21
And here will rest me.,21
Come thou gentle day!,21
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.,21
Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS,21
Abide me if thou darest; for well I wot,21
And darest not stand nor look me in the face.,21
Come hither: I am here.,21
If ever I thy face by daylight see:,21
To measure out my length on this cold bed.,21
Lies down and sleeps,21
O weary night O long and tedious night,21
That I may back to Athens by daylight,21
And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,21
Lies down and sleeps,21
Two of both kinds make up four.,21
Cupid is a knavish lad,21
Re-enter HERMIA,21
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,21
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.,21
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!,21
On the ground,21
I'll apply,21
Gentle lover remedy.,21
When thou wakest,21
True delight,21
Of thy former lady's eye:,21
That every man should take his own,21
Jack shall have Jill;,21
The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well.,21
ACT IV,21
lying asleep.,21
Come sit thee down upon this flowery bed,21
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,21
Where's Peaseblossom?,21
Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?,21
Mounsieur Cobweb good mounsieur get you your,21
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and good,21
yourself too much in the action mounsieur; and,21
I would be loath to have you overflown with a,21
Ready.,21
leave your courtesy good mounsieur.,21
Nothing good mounsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb,21
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I,21
I must scratch.,21
my sweet love?,21
the tongs and the bones.,21
Truly a peck of provender: I could munch your good,21
of hay: good hay sweet hay hath no fellow.,21
The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts.,21
But I pray you let none of your people stir me: I,21
Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms.,21
Exeunt fairies,21
Gently entwist; the female ivy so,21
O how I love thee! how I dote on thee!,21
Enter PUCK,21
See'st thou this sweet sight?,21
For meeting her of late behind the wood,21
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;,21
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;,21
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,21
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.,21
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,21
Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent,21
And now I have the boy I will undo,21
And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp,21
That he awaking when the other do,21
And think no more of this night's accidents,21
But first I will release the fairy queen.,21
See as thou wast wont to see:,21
Hath such force and blessed power.,21
My Oberon! what visions have I seen!,21
There lies your love.,21
O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!,21
Titania music call; and strike more dead,21
Music ho! music such as charmeth sleep!,21
Now when thou wakest with thine,21
Sound music! Come my queen take hands with me,21
Now thou and I are new in amity,21
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,21
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be,21
Fairy king attend and mark:,21
Then my queen in silence sad,21
We the globe can compass soon,21
Come my lord and in our flight,21
That I sleeping here was found,21
Exeunt,21
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train,21
For now our observation is perform'd;,21
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.,21
Dispatch I say and find the forester.,21
We will fair queen up to the mountain's top,21
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.,21
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear,21
Such gallant chiding: for besides the groves,21
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard,21
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,21
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;,21
Slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells,21
Was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn,21
Judge when you hear. But soft! what nymphs are these?,21
And this Lysander; this Demetrius is;,21
I wonder of their being here together.,21
The rite of May and hearing our intent,21
But speak Egeus; is not this the day,21
It is my lord.,21
Horns and shout within. LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HELENA and HERMIA wake and start up,21
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?,21
I pray you all stand up.,21
How comes this gentle concord in the world,21
To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?,21
Half sleep half waking: but as yet I swear,21
But as I think--for truly would I speak,21
I came with Hermia hither: our intent,21
Without the peril of the Athenian law.,21
I beg the law the law upon his head.,21
Thereby to have defeated you and me,21
Of my consent that she should be your wife.,21
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;,21
Fair Helena in fancy following me.,21
But by some power it is--my love to Hermia,21
As the remembrance of an idle gaud,21
And all the faith the virtue of my heart,21
Is only Helena. To her my lord,21
But like in sickness did I loathe this food;,21
Now I do wish it love it long for it,21
Fair lovers you are fortunately met:,21
Egeus I will overbear your will;,21
These couples shall eternally be knit:,21
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.,21
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.,21
Exeunt THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train,21
Methinks I see these things with parted eye,21
So methinks:,21
Mine own and not mine own.,21
That we are awake? It seems to me,21
The duke was here and bid us follow him?,21
And Hippolyta.,21
Why then we are awake: let's follow him,21
Exeunt,21
answer: my next is 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!,21
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life stolen,21
vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to,21
about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there,21
methought I had--but man is but a patched fool if,21
of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not,21
to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream,21
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,21
latter end of a play before the duke:,21
sing it at her death.,21
SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.,21
Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?,21
transported.,21
not forward doth it?,21
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.,21
man in Athens.,21
paramour for a sweet voice.,21
a thing of naught.,21
Masters the duke is coming from the temple and,21
if our sport had gone forward we had all been made,21
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a,21
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him,21
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in,21
Enter BOTTOM,21
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!,21
what; for if I tell you I am no true Athenian. I,21
Let us hear sweet Bottom.,21
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,21
pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look,21
play is preferred. In any case let Thisby have,21
pair his nails for they shall hang out for the,21
nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath; and I,21
comedy. No more words: away! go away!,21
ACT V,21
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE Lords and Attendants,21
lovers speak of.,21
These antique fables nor these fairy toys.,21
Such shaping fantasies that apprehend,21
The lunatic the lover and the poet,21
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,21
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:,21
Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven;,21
The forms of things unknown the poet's pen,21
A local habitation and a name.,21
That if it would but apprehend some joy,21
Or in the night imagining some fear,21
But all the story of the night told over,21
More witnesseth than fancy's images,21
But howsoever strange and admirable.,21
Enter LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HERMIA and HELENA,21
Accompany your hearts!,21
Wait in your royal walks your board your bed!,21
To wear away this long age of three hours,21
Where is our usual manager of mirth?,21
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?,21
Here mighty Theseus.,21
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile,21
There is a brief how many sports are ripe:,21
Giving a paper,21
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.',21
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.,21
The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,21
That is an old device; and it was play'd,21
Reads,21
Of Learning late deceased in beggary.',21
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.,21
A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus,21
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!,21
How shall we find the concord of this discord?,21
Which is as brief as I have known a play;,21
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play,21
And tragical my noble lord it is;,21
Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess,21
The passion of loud laughter never shed.,21
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,21
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories,21
And we will hear it.,21
It is not for you: I have heard it over,21
Unless you can find sport in their intents,21
To do you service.,21
For never anything can be amiss,21
Go bring them in: and take your places ladies.,21
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged,21
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing.,21
The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing.,21
And what poor duty cannot do noble respect,21
Where I have come great clerks have purposed,21
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,21
Throttle their practised accent in their fears,21
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweet,21
And in the modesty of fearful duty,21
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.,21
In least speak most to my capacity.,21
So please your grace the Prologue is address'd.,21
Flourish of trumpets,21
If we offend it is with our good will.,21
But with good will. To show our simple skill,21
Consider then we come but in despite.,21
Our true intent is. All for your delight,21
The actors are at hand and by their show,21
This fellow doth not stand upon points.,21
not the stop. A good moral my lord: it is not,21
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child,21
His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing,21
Enter Pyramus and Thisbe Wall Moonshine and Lion,21
But wonder on till truth make all things plain.,21
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.,21
Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;,21
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.,21
Presenteth Moonshine; for if you will know,21
To meet at Ninus' tomb there there to woo.,21
The trusty Thisby coming first by night,21
And as she fled her mantle she did fall,21
Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall,21
Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade,21
And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade,21
Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain,21
Exeunt Prologue Thisbe Lion and Moonshine,21
No wonder my lord: one lion may when many asses do.,21
That I one Snout by name present a wall;,21
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,21
Did whisper often very secretly.,21
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:,21
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.,21
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard,21
Enter Pyramus,21
O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!,21
O night O night! alack alack alack,21
And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall,21
Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall,21
Wall holds up his fingers,21
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.,21
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!,21
No in truth sir he should not. 'Deceiving me',21
spy her through the wall. You shall see it will,21
Enter Thisbe,21
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!,21
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.,21
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!,21
Think what thou wilt I am thy lover's grace;,21
And I like Helen till the Fates me kill.,21
As Shafalus to Procrus I to you.,21
I kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all.,21
Tide life 'tide death I come without delay.,21
Thus have I Wall my part discharged so;,21
Exit,21
No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear,21
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.,21
are no worse if imagination amend them.,21
If we imagine no worse of them than they of,21
come two noble beasts in a man and a lion.,21
You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear,21
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,21
Then know that I one Snug the joiner am,21
For if I should as lion come in strife,21
A very gentle beast of a good conscience.,21
This lion is a very fox for his valour.,21
Not so my lord; for his valour cannot carry his,21
His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour;,21
leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon.,21
He should have worn the horns on his head.,21
invisible within the circumference.,21
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.,21
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the,21
He dares not come there for the candle; for you,21
I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!,21
he is in the wane; but yet in courtesy in all,21
Proceed Moon.,21
lanthorn is the moon; I the man in the moon; this,21
Why all these should be in the lanthorn; for all,21
Enter Thisbe,21
[Roaring]  Oh--,21
Well roared Lion.,21
Well shone Moon. Truly the moon shines with a,21
The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle and exit,21
And so the lion vanished.,21
Enter Pyramus,21
I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright;,21
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.,21
But mark poor knight,21
Eyes do you see?,21
O dainty duck! O dear!,21
What stain'd with blood!,21
O Fates come come,21
Quail crush conclude and quell!,21
go near to make a man look sad.,21
O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame?,21
Which is--no no--which was the fairest dame,21
with cheer.,21
Out sword and wound,21
Ay that left pap,21
Stabs himself,21
Now am I dead,21
My soul is in the sky:,21
Moon take thy flight:,21
Now die die die die die.,21
No die but an ace for him; for he is but one.,21
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and,21
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes,21
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and,21
Re-enter Thisbe,21
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.,21
Thisbe is the better; he for a man God warrant us;,21
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.,21
Asleep my love?,21
O Pyramus arise!,21
Dead dead? A tomb,21
These My lips,21
These yellow cowslip cheeks,21
Lovers make moan:,21
O Sisters Three,21
With hands as pale as milk;,21
Since you have shore,21
Tongue not a word:,21
Come blade my breast imbrue:,21
And farewell friends;,21
Adieu adieu adieu.,21
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.,21
[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that,21
epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two,21
No epilogue I pray you; for your play needs no,21
dead there needs none to be blamed. Marry if he,21
in Thisbe's garter it would have been a fine,21
discharged. But come your Bergomask: let your,21
A dance,21
Lovers to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.,21
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.,21
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends to bed.,21
In nightly revels and new jollity.,21
Enter PUCK,21
And the wolf behowls the moon;,21
All with weary task fordone.,21
Whilst the screech-owl screeching loud,21
In remembrance of a shroud.,21
That the graves all gaping wide,21
In the church-way paths to glide:,21
By the triple Hecate's team,21
Following darkness like a dream,21
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:,21
To sweep the dust behind the door.,21
Through the house give gathering light,21
Every elf and fairy sprite,21
And this ditty after me,21
First rehearse your song by rote,21
Hand in hand with fairy grace,21
Song and dance,21
Through this house each fairy stray.,21
Which by us shall blessed be;,21
Ever shall be fortunate.,21
Ever true in loving be;,21
Shall not in their issue stand;,21
Nor mark prodigious such as are,21
Shall upon their children be.,21
Every fairy take his gait;,21
Through this palace with sweet peace;,21
Ever shall in safety rest.,21
Meet me all by break of day.,21
If we shadows have offended,21
That you have but slumber'd here,21
And this weak and idle theme,21
Gentles do not reprehend:,21
And as I am an honest Puck,21
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,21
Else the Puck a liar call;,21
Give me your hands if we be friends,21
ACT I,22
Enter LEONATO HERO and BEATRICE with a Messenger,22
comes this night to Messina.,22
when I left him.,22
But few of any sort and none of name.,22
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath,22
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by,22
promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb,22
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to,22
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much,22
I have already delivered him letters and there,22
not show itself modest enough without a badge of,22
Did he break out into tears?,22
A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces,22
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!,22
wars or no?,22
in the army of any sort.,22
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.,22
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged,22
the challenge subscribed for Cupid and challenged,22
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath,22
Faith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much;,22
He hath done good service lady in these wars.,22
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an,22
And a good soldier too lady.,22
A lord to a lord a man to a man; stuffed with all,22
It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:,22
You must not sir mistake my niece. There is a,22
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit,22
Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last,22
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if,22
bear it for a difference between himself and his,22
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his,22
Is't possible?,22
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the,22
I see lady the gentleman is not in your books.,22
you who is his companion? Is there no young,22
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.,22
is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker,22
he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a,22
I will hold friends with you lady.,22
You will never run mad niece.,22
Don Pedro is approached.,22
Good Signior Leonato you are come to meet your,22
cost and you encounter it.,22
your grace: for trouble being gone comfort should,22
and happiness takes his leave.,22
is your daughter.,22
Were you in doubt sir that you asked her?,22
You have it full Benedick: we may guess by this,22
herself. Be happy lady; for you are like an,22
If Signior Leonato be her father she would not,22
like him as she is.,22
Benedick: nobody marks you.,22
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath,22
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come,22
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I,22
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard,22
A dear happiness to women: they would else have,22
and my cold blood I am of your humour for that: I,22
swear he loves me.,22
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate,22
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such,22
Well you are a rare parrot-teacher.,22
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and,22
name; I have done.,22
That is the sum of all Leonato. Signior Claudio,22
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at,22
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no,22
If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn.,22
Let me bid you welcome my lord: being reconciled to,22
I thank you: I am not of many words but I thank,22
Please it your grace lead on?,22
Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO,22
I noted her not; but I looked on her.,22
Do you question me as an honest man should do for,22
after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex?,22
Why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high,22
for a great praise: only this commendation I can,22
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is I,22
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me,22
Would you buy her that you inquire after her?,22
Yea and a case to put it into. But speak you this,22
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a,22
you to go in the song?,22
looked on.,22
matter: there's her cousin an she were not,22
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I,22
I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the,22
Is't come to this? In faith hath not the world,22
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?,22
into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away,22
Re-enter DON PEDRO,22
not to Leonato's?,22
I charge thee on thy allegiance.,22
man; I would have you think so; but on my,22
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.,22
short daughter.,22
Like the old tale my lord: 'it is not so nor,22
so.',22
should be otherwise.,22
You speak this to fetch me in my lord.,22
And in faith my lord I spoke mine.,22
That I love her I feel.,22
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor,22
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.,22
of beauty.,22
of his will.,22
brought me up I likewise give her most humble,22
forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,22
them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the,22
I may go the finer I will live a bachelor.,22
With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord,22
with love than I will get again with drinking pick,22
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of,22
Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou,22
If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot,22
the shoulder and called Adam.,22
doth bear the yoke.',22
Benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set,22
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is,22
Here you may see Benedick the married man.',22
Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in,22
I look for an earthquake too then.,22
meantime good Signior Benedick repair to,22
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made,22
I have almost matter enough in me for such an,22
To the tuition of God: From my house if I had it--,22
Nay mock not mock not. The body of your,22
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere,22
conscience: and so I leave you.,22
My liege your highness now may do me good.,22
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn,22
Hath Leonato any son my lord?,22
Dost thou affect her Claudio?,22
When you went onward on this ended action,22
That liked but had a rougher task in hand,22
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts,22
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,22
Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.,22
And tire the hearer with a book of words.,22
And I will break with her and with her father,22
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?,22
That know love's grief by his complexion!,22
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.,22
The fairest grant is the necessity.,22
And I will fit thee with the remedy.,22
I will assume thy part in some disguise,22
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart,22
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:,22
And the conclusion is she shall be thine.,22
Exeunt,22
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO meeting,22
hath he provided this music?,22
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.,22
As the event stamps them: but they have a good,22
Claudio walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine,22
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my,22
this night in a dance: and if he found her,22
top and instantly break with you of it.,22
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and,22
No no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear,22
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,22
Enter Attendants,22
mercy friend; go you with me and I will use your,22
Exeunt,22
Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE,22
of measure sad?,22
therefore the sadness is without limit.,22
And when I have heard it what blessing brings it?,22
sufferance.,22
born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral,22
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile,22
for no man's leisure sleep when I am drowsy and,22
claw no man in his humour.,22
till you may do it without controlment. You have of,22
ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is,22
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful,22
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in,22
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob,22
be a flattering honest man it must not be denied,22
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I,22
mouth I would bite; if I had my liberty I would do,22
seek not to alter me.,22
I make all use of it for I use it only.,22
Enter BORACHIO,22
I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your,22
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.,22
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to,22
Marry it is your brother's right hand.,22
Even he.,22
he?,22
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?,22
musty room comes me the prince and Claudio hand,22
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the,22
obtained her give her to Count Claudio.,22
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the,22
bless myself every way. You are both sure and will assist me?,22
Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the,22
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?,22
Exeunt,22
SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.,22
Was not Count John here at supper?,22
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see,22
He is of a very melancholy disposition.,22
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too,22
like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling.,22
mouth and half Count John's melancholy in Signior,22
With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money,22
in the world if a' could get her good-will.,22
husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.,22
Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's,22
cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.,22
Just if he send me no husband; for the which,22
evening. Lord I could not endure a husband with a,22
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.,22
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a,22
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than,22
man I am not for him: therefore I will even take,22
apes into hell.,22
No but to the gate; and there will the devil meet,22
say 'Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to,22
I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the,22
there live we as merry as the day is long.,22
by your father.,22
and say 'Father as it please you.' But yet for all,22
make another curtsy and say 'Father as it please,22
Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.,22
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be,22
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?,22
and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.,22
do solicit you in that kind you know your answer.,22
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too,22
and so dance out the answer. For hear me Hero:,22
a measure and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot,22
fantastical; the wedding mannerly-modest as a,22
repentance and with his bad legs falls into the,22
Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly.,22
The revellers are entering brother: make good room.,22
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO BENEDICK BALTHASAR DON JOHN BORACHIO MARGARET URSULA and others masked,22
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,22
With me in your company?,22
And when please you to say so?,22
should be like the case!,22
Why then your visor should be thatched.,22
Drawing her aside,22
So would not I for your own sake; for I have many,22
Which is one?,22
I love you the better: the hearers may cry Amen.,22
Amen.,22
done! Answer clerk.,22
I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.,22
I know you by the waggling of your head.,22
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were,22
are he you are he.,22
Come come do you think I do not know you by your,22
mum you are he: graces will appear and there's an,22
Will you not tell me who told you so?,22
Nor will you not tell me who you are?,22
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit,22
Signior Benedick that said so.,22
I am sure you know him well enough.,22
Did he never make you laugh?,22
Why he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;,22
none but libertines delight in him; and the,22
for he both pleases men and angers them and then,22
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.,22
Do do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;,22
strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a,22
supper that night.,22
We must follow the leaders.,22
Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at,22
Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN BORACHIO and CLAUDIO,22
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.,22
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.,22
You know me well; I am he.,22
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you dissuade him,22
do the part of an honest man in it.,22
I heard him swear his affection.,22
Come let us to the banquet.,22
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,22
Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.,22
Save in the office and affairs of love:,22
Let every eye negotiate for itself,22
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.,22
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero!,22
Count Claudio?,22
Come will you go with me?,22
Even to the next willow about your own business,22
about your neck like an usurer's chain? or under,22
it one way for the prince hath got your Hero.,22
Why that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they,22
have served you thus?,22
Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the,22
If it will not be I'll leave you.,22
Alas poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.,22
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go,22
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it,22
that puts the world into her person and so gives me,22
Re-enter DON PEDRO,22
Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame.,22
warren: I told him and I think I told him true,22
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,22
to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped.,22
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being,22
companion and he steals it.,22
transgression is in the stealer.,22
and the garland too; for the garland he might have,22
you who as I take it have stolen his birds' nest.,22
the owner.,22
you say honestly.,22
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much,22
O she misused me past the endurance of a block!,22
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and,22
myself that I was the prince's jester that I was,22
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood,22
me. She speaks poniards and every word stabs:,22
there were no living near her; she would infect to,22
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before,22
turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make,22
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God,22
she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a,22
would go thither; so indeed all disquiet horror,22
Look here she comes.,22
Will your grace command me any service to the,22
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;,22
furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of,22
Cham's beard do you any embassage to the Pigmies,22
harpy. You have no employment for me?,22
O God sir here's a dish I love not: I cannot,22
Exit,22
Signior Benedick.,22
him use for it a double heart for his single one:,22
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.,22
So I would not he should do me my lord lest I,22
Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek.,22
Not sad my lord.,22
Neither my lord.,22
well; but civil count civil as an orange and,22
I' faith lady I think your blazon to be true;,22
false. Here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and,22
and his good will obtained: name the day of,22
Count take of me my daughter and with her my,22
grace say Amen to it.,22
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were,22
you are mine I am yours: I give away myself for,22
Speak cousin; or if you cannot stop his mouth,22
In faith lady you have a merry heart.,22
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his,22
And so she doth cousin.,22
world but I and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a,22
Lady Beatrice I will get you one.,22
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your,22
Will you have me lady?,22
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear,22
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.,22
becomes you; for out of question you were born in,22
No sure my lord my mother cried; but then there,22
Cousins God give you joy!,22
I cry you mercy uncle. By your grace's pardon.,22
By my troth a pleasant-spirited lady.,22
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps and,22
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked,22
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.,22
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.,22
they would talk themselves mad.,22
To-morrow my lord: time goes on crutches till love,22
Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just,22
things answer my mind.,22
but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go,22
Hercules' labours; which is to bring Signior,22
affection the one with the other. I would fain have,22
you three will but minister such assistance as I,22
My lord I am for you though it cost me ten,22
And I my lord.,22
I will do any modest office my lord to help my,22
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that,22
strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I,22
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I with your,22
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he,22
Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be,22
and I will tell you my drift.,22
SCENE II. The same.,22
It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the,22
Yea my lord; but I can cross it.,22
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,22
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?,22
dishonesty shall appear in me.,22
I think I told your lordship a year since how much,22
gentlewoman to Hero.,22
I can at any unseasonable instant of the night,22
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?,22
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that,22
Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold,22
What proof shall I make of that?,22
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any,22
Only to despite them I will endeavour any thing.,22
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know,22
prince and Claudio as--in love of your brother's,22
reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the,22
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:,22
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,22
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night,22
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be,22
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called,22
Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put,22
thy fee is a thousand ducats.,22
shall not shame me.,22
Exeunt,22
Enter BENEDICK,22
Enter Boy,22
In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither,22
I am here already sir.,22
Exit Boy,22
another man is a fool when he dedicates his,22
such shallow follies in others become the argument,22
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music,22
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known,22
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,22
speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man,22
words are a very fantastical banquet just so many,22
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not,22
I'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster,22
is fair yet I am well; another is wise yet I am,22
graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in,22
or I'll none; virtuous or I'll never cheapen her;,22
near me; noble or not I for an angel; of good,22
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and,22
Withdraws,22
Come shall we hear this music?,22
As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!,22
O very well my lord: the music ended,22
Enter BALTHASAR with Music,22
O good my lord tax not so bad a voice,22
It is the witness still of excellency,22
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more.,22
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,22
Yet will he swear he loves.,22
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,22
Note this before my notes;,22
Why these are very crotchets that he speaks;,22
Air,22
not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out,22
all's done.,22
Sigh no more ladies sigh no more,22
One foot in sea and one on shore,22
Then sigh not so but let them go,22
Converting all your sounds of woe,22
Sing no more ditties sing no moe,22
The fraud of men was ever so,22
Then sigh not so  and c.,22
And an ill singer my lord.,22
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,22
voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the,22
it.,22
get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we,22
The best I can my lord.,22
Exit BALTHASAR,22
to-day that your niece Beatrice was in love with,22
O ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did,22
No nor I neither; but most wonderful that she,22
all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.,22
By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think,22
affection: it is past the infinite of thought.,22
Faith like enough.,22
passion came so near the life of passion as she,22
Why what effects of passion shows she?,22
What effects my lord? She will sit you you heard,22
She did indeed.,22
thought her spirit had been invincible against all,22
I would have sworn it had my lord; especially,22
I should think this a gull but that the,22
sure hide himself in such reverence.,22
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?,22
Tis true indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall,22
with scorn write to him that I love him?',22
him; for she'll be up twenty times a night and,22
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.,22
pretty jest your daughter told us of.,22
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?,22
O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;,22
to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I,22
should flout him if he writ to me; yea though I,22
Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs,22
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!',22
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter,22
to herself: it is very true.,22
other if she will not discover it.,22
torment the poor lady worse.,22
excellent sweet lady; and out of all suspicion,22
And she is exceeding wise.,22
O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender,22
the victory. I am sorry for her as I have just,22
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would,22
myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear,22
Were it good think you?,22
will die if he love her not and she will die ere,22
her rather than she will bate one breath of her,22
She doth well: if she should make tender of her,22
man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit.,22
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.,22
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.,22
As Hector I assure you: and in the managing of,22
avoids them with great discretion or undertakes,22
If he do fear God a' must necessarily keep peace:,22
quarrel with fear and trembling.,22
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests,22
we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?,22
good counsel.,22
Well we will hear further of it by your daughter:,22
could wish he would modestly examine himself to see,22
My lord will you walk? dinner is ready.,22
trust my expectation.,22
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The,22
another's dotage and no such matter: that's the,22
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.,22
[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the,22
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it,22
why it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:,22
the love come from her; they say too that she will,22
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy,22
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a,22
so I cannot reprove it; and wise but for loving,22
no great argument of her folly for I will be,22
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,22
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat,22
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of,22
No the world must be peopled. When I said I would,22
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!,22
her.,22
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.,22
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take,22
not have come.,22
Yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's,22
signior: fare you well.,22
Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in,22
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains,22
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do,22
love her I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.,22
ACT III,22
Enter HERO MARGARET and URSULA,22
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice,22
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula,22
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;,22
Where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun,22
Made proud by princes that advance their pride,22
To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;,22
I'll make her come I warrant you presently.,22
Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come,22
Our talk must only be of Benedick.,22
To praise him more than ever man did merit:,22
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter,22
That only wounds by hearsay.,22
Now begin;,22
Close by the ground to hear our conference.,22
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,22
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now,22
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.,22
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.,22
No truly Ursula she is too disdainful;,22
As haggerds of the rock.,22
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?,22
And did they bid you tell her of it madam?,22
But I persuaded them if they loved Benedick,22
And never to let Beatrice know of it.,22
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed,22
O god of love! I know he doth deserve,22
But Nature never framed a woman's heart,22
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,22
Values itself so highly that to her,22
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,22
Sure I think so;,22
She knew his love lest she make sport at it.,22
How wise how noble young how rarely featured,22
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;,22
Made a foul blot; if tall a lance ill-headed;,22
If speaking why a vane blown with all winds;,22
So turns she every man the wrong side out,22
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.,22
No not to be so odd and from all fashions,22
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,22
Out of myself press me to death with wit.,22
Consume away in sighs waste inwardly:,22
Which is as bad as die with tickling.,22
No; rather I will go to Benedick,22
And truly I'll devise some honest slanders,22
How much an ill word may empoison liking.,22
She cannot be so much without true judgment--,22
As she is prized to have--as to refuse,22
He is the only man of Italy.,22
I pray you be not angry with me madam,22
For shape for bearing argument and valour,22
Indeed he hath an excellent good name.,22
When are you married madam?,22
I'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel,22
She's limed I warrant you: we have caught her madam.,22
Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps.,22
[Coming forward],22
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?,22
No glory lives behind the back of such.,22
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:,22
To bind our loves up in a holy band;,22
Believe it better than reportingly.,22
SCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S house,22
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and,22
I'll bring you thither my lord if you'll,22
Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss,22
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold,22
of his head to the sole of his foot he is all,22
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at,22
tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his,22
Gallants I am not as I have been.,22
I hope he be in love.,22
him to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,22
I have the toothache.,22
Hang it!,22
What! sigh for the toothache?,22
Well every one can master a grief but he that has,22
Yet say I he is in love.,22
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as to be,22
shape of two countries at once as a German from,22
the hip upward no doublet. Unless he have a fancy,22
fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is.,22
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o',22
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?,22
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already,22
Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard.,22
out by that?,22
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.,22
Yea or to paint himself? for the which I hear,22
Nay but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into,22
Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,22
Nay but I know who loves him.,22
Yes and his ill conditions; and in despite of,22
She shall be buried with her face upwards.,22
signior walk aside with me: I have studied eight,22
hobby-horses must not hear.,22
For my life to break with him about Beatrice.,22
played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two,22
Enter DON JOHN,22
Good den brother.,22
In private?,22
what I would speak of concerns him.,22
[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married,22
You know he does.,22
If there be any impediment I pray you discover it.,22
hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will,22
well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect,22
labour ill bestowed.,22
I came hither to tell you; and circumstances,22
the lady is disloyal.,22
Even she; Leonato's Hero your Hero every man's Hero:,22
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I,22
title and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till,22
see her chamber-window entered even the night,22
to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour,22
May this be so?,22
If you dare not trust that you see confess not,22
you enough; and when you have seen more and heard,22
If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry,22
wed there will I shame her.,22
with thee to disgrace her.,22
witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight and,22
O day untowardly turned!,22
O plague right well prevented! so will you say when,22
Exeunt,22
Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch,22
Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer,22
Nay that were a punishment too good for them if,22
chosen for the prince's watch.,22
First who think you the most desertless man to be,22
Hugh Otecake sir or George Seacole; for they can,22
Come hither neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed,22
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.,22
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,22
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,22
vanity. You are thought here to be the most,22
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your,22
to bid any man stand in the prince's name.,22
Why then take no note of him but let him go; and,22
thank God you are rid of a knave.,22
of the prince's subjects.,22

How if they will not?,22
they make you not then the better answer you may,22
Well sir.,22
of your office to be no true man; and for such,22
why the more is for your honesty.,22
hands on him?,22
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable,22
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.,22
Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more,22
If you hear a child cry in the night you must call,22
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?,22
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her,22
Tis very true.,22
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the,22
Nay by'r our lady that I think a' cannot.,22
the statutes he may stay him: marry not without,22
to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a,22
By'r lady I think it be so.,22
any matter of weight chances call up me: keep your,22
Come neighbour.,22
upon the church-bench till two and then all to bed.,22
about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being,22
Adieu: be vigitant I beseech you.,22
Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE,22
[Aside]  Peace! stir not.,22
Here man; I am at thy elbow.,22
scab follow.,22
with thy tale.,22
it drizzles rain; and I will like a true drunkard,22
[Aside]  Some treason masters: yet stand close.,22
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?,22
villany should be so rich; for when rich villains,22
price they will.,22
That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that,22
nothing to a man.,22
I mean the fashion.,22
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But,22

thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a,22
Didst thou not hear somebody?,22
Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this,22
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?,22
in the reeky painting sometime like god Bel's,22
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,22
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears,22
thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast,22
Not so neither: but know that I have to-night,22
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress',22
night--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first,22
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don,22
And thought they Margaret was Hero?,22
devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly,22
the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly,22
Don John had made away went Claudio enraged; swore,22
at the temple and there before the whole,22
and send her home again without a husband.,22
Call up the right master constable. We have here,22

Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.,22

And bid her come hither.,22
Exit,22
No pray thee good Meg I'll wear this.,22

gown that they praise so.,22
By my troth 's but a night-gown in respect of,22
silver set with pearls down sleeves side sleeves,22
but for a fine quaint graceful and excellent,22
God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is,22
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.,22
Of what lady? of speaking honourably? Is not,22
honourable without marriage? I think you would have,22
thinking do not wrest true speaking I'll offend,22

Good morrow coz.,22
Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?,22
Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a,22
Ye light o' love with your heels! then if your,22

Tis almost five o'clock cousin; tis time you were,22
For a hawk a horse or a husband?,22
Well and you be not turned Turk there's no more,22

These gloves the count sent me; they are an,22

O God help me! God help me! how long have you,22
Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?,22

and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.,22
Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in,22
Moral! no by my troth I have no moral meaning; I,22

Brief I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.,22
Yes in truth it is sir.,22
Goodman Verges sir speaks a little off the,22
blunt as God help I would desire they were; but,22
Yes I thank God I am as honest as any man living,22
Comparisons are odorous: palabras neighbour Verges.,22
It pleases your worship to say so but we are the,22
if I were as tedious as a king I could find it in,22
All thy tediousness on me ah?,22
I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any,22

I would fain know what you have to say.,22

A good old man sir; he will be talking: as they,22

Know you any count?,22
O what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily,22
How now! interjections? Why then some be of,22
Stand thee by friar. Father by your leave:,22
Give me this maid your daughter?,22
And what have I to give you back whose worth,22
Nothing unless you render her again.,22
There Leonato take her back again:,22
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.,22
O what authority and show of truth,22
Comes not that blood as modest evidence,22
All you that see her that she were a maid,22
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;,22
What do you mean my lord?,22
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.,22
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,22
I know what you would say: if I have known her,22
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:,22
I never tempted her with word too large;,22
Bashful sincerity and comely love.,22
Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:,22
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;,22
Than Venus or those pamper'd animals,22
Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide?,22
What should I speak?,22
To link my dear friend to a common stale.,22
Sir they are spoken and these things are true.,22
True! O God!,22
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?,22
All this is so: but what of this my lord?,22
And by that fatherly and kindly power,22
I charge thee do so as thou art my child.,22
What kind of catechising call you this?,22
Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name,22
Marry that can Hero;,22
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight,22
Now if you are a maid answer to this.,22
Why then are you no maiden. Leonato,22
Myself my brother and this grieved count,22
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window,22
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had,22
Fie fie! they are not to be named my lord,22
There is not chastity enough in language,22
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.,22
If half thy outward graces had been placed,22
But fare thee well most foul most fair! farewell,22
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,22
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,22
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?,22
Why how now cousin! wherefore sink you down?,22
Smother her spirits up.,22
How doth the lady?,22
Hero! why Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!,22
Death is the fairest cover for her shame,22
How now cousin Hero!,22
Dost thou look up?,22
Wherefore! Why doth not every earthly thing,22
The story that is printed in her blood?,22
For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,22
Myself would on the rearward of reproaches,22
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?,22
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?,22
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,22
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;,22
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised,22
That I myself was to myself not mine,22
Into a pit of ink that the wide sea,22
And salt too little which may season give,22
Sir sir be patient.,22
I know not what to say.,22
Lady were you her bedfellow last night?,22
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.,22
Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!,22
Who loved her so that speaking of her foulness,22
Hear me a little;,22
And given way unto this course of fortune.,22
By noting of the lady I have mark'd,22
To start into her face a thousand innocent shames,22
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,22
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;,22
Which with experimental seal doth warrant,22
My reverence calling nor divinity,22
Under some biting error.,22
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left,22
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:,22
That which appears in proper nakedness?,22
They know that do accuse me; I know none:,22
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,22
Prove you that any man with me conversed,22
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,22
There is some strange misprision in the princes.,22
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,22
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.,22
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,22
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,22
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,22
But they shall find awaked in such a kind,22
Ability in means and choice of friends,22
Pause awhile,22
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:,22
And publish it that she is dead indeed;,22
And on your family's old monument,22
That appertain unto a burial.,22
Marry this well carried shall on her behalf,22
But not for that dream I on this strange course,22
She dying as it must so be maintain'd,22
Shall be lamented pitied and excused,22
That what we have we prize not to the worth,22
Why then we rack the value then we find,22
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:,22
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep,22
And every lovely organ of her life,22
More moving-delicate and full of life,22
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,22
And wish he had not so accused her,22
Let this be so and doubt not but success,22
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.,22
The supposition of the lady's death,22
And if it sort not well you may conceal her,22
In some reclusive and religious life,22
Signior Leonato let the friar advise you:,22
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,22
As secretly and justly as your soul,22
Being that I flow in grief,22
Tis well consented: presently away;,22
Come lady die to live: this wedding-day,22
Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE,22
Yea and I will weep a while longer.,22
You have no reason; I do it freely.,22
Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!,22
A very even way but no such friend.,22
It is a man's office but not yours.,22
not that strange?,22
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as,22
confess nothing nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.,22
Do not swear and eat it.,22
him eat it that says I love not you.,22
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest,22
Why then God forgive me!,22
You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to,22
And do it with all thy heart.,22
left to protest.,22
Kill Claudio.,22
You kill me to deny it. Farewell.,22
I am gone though I am here: there is no love in,22
Beatrice--,22
We'll be friends first.,22
Is Claudio thine enemy?,22
hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman? O,22
come to take hands; and then with public,22
--O God that I were a man! I would eat his heart,22
Hear me Beatrice--,22
Nay but Beatrice--,22
Beat--,22
a goodly count Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,22
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But,22
compliment and men are only turned into tongue and,22
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a,22
Tarry good Beatrice. By this hand I love thee.,22
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?,22
Enough I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will,22
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you,22
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so farewell.,22
SCENE II. A prison.,22
Is our whole dissembly appeared?,22
Which be the malefactors?,22
Nay that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.,22
examined? let them come before master constable.,22
name friend?,22
Pray write down Borachio. Yours sirrah?,22
Write down master gentleman Conrade. Masters do,22
Yea sir we hope.,22
write God first; for God defend but God should go,22
that you are little better than false knaves; and it,22
you for yourselves?,22
A marvellous witty fellow I assure you: but I,22
word in your ear: sir I say to you it is thought,22
Sir I say to you we are none.,22
tale. Have you writ down that they are none?,22
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.,22
come forth. Masters I charge you in the prince's,22
This man said sir that Don John the prince's,22
Write down Prince John a villain. Why this is flat,22
Master constable--,22
I promise thee.,22
Marry that he had received a thousand ducats of,22
Flat burglary as ever was committed.,22
What else fellow?,22
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.,22
redemption for this.,22
This is all.,22
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;,22
refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died.,22
brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show,22
Exit,22
Let them be in the hands--,22
God's my life where's the sexton? let him write,22
Thou naughty varlet!,22
Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not,22
down an ass! But masters remember that I am an,22
that I am an ass. No thou villain thou art full of,22
I am a wise fellow and which is more an officer,22
more as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in,22
rich fellow enough go to; and a fellow that hath,22
thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that,22
Exeunt,22
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.,22
If you go on thus you will kill yourself:,22
Against yourself.,22
Which falls into mine ears as profitless,22
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear,22
Bring me a father that so loved his child,22
And bid him speak of patience;,22
And let it answer every strain for strain,22
In every lineament branch shape and form:,22
Bid sorrow wag cry 'hem!' when he should groan,22
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,22
But there is no such man: for brother men,22
Which they themselves not feel; but tasting it,22
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,22
Charm ache with air and agony with words:,22
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,22
To be so moral when he shall endure,22
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.,22
I pray thee peace. I will be flesh and blood;,22
That could endure the toothache patiently,22
And made a push at chance and sufferance.,22
Make those that do offend you suffer too.,22
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;,22
And all of them that thus dishonour her.,22
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO,22
Good day to both of you.,22
We have some haste Leonato.,22
Are you so hasty now? well all is one.,22
If he could right himself with quarreling,22
Who wrongs him?,22
Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword;,22
Marry beshrew my hand,22
In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword.,22
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,22
What I have done being young or what would do,22
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me,22
And with grey hairs and bruise of many days,22
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;,22
And she lies buried with her ancestors;,22
Save this of hers framed by thy villany!,22
Thine Claudio; thine I say.,22
My lord my lord,22
Despite his nice fence and his active practise,22
Away! I will not have to do with you.,22
If thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man.,22
But that's no matter; let him kill one first;,22
Come follow me boy; come sir boy come follow me:,22
Nay as I am a gentleman I will.,22
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;,22
That dare as well answer a man indeed,22
Boys apes braggarts Jacks milksops!,22
Hold you content. What man! I know them yea,22
Scrambling out-facing fashion-monging boys,22
Go anticly show outward hideousness,22
How they might hurt their enemies if they durst;,22
But brother Antony--,22
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.,22
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:,22
But what was true and very full of proof.,22
I will not hear you.,22
And shall or some of us will smart for it.,22
See see; here comes the man we went to seek.,22
Now signior what news?,22
Welcome signior: you are almost come to part,22
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off,22
Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had,22
In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came,22
We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are,22
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?,22
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?,22
their wit. I will bid thee draw as we do the,22
As I am an honest man he looks pale. Art thou,22
What courage man! What though care killed a cat,22
Sir I shall meet your wit in the career and you,22
Nay then give him another staff: this last was,22
By this light he changes more and more: I think,22
If he be he knows how to turn his girdle.,22
God bless me from a challenge!,22
I will make it good how you dare with what you,22
protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet,22
hear from you.,22
What a feast a feast?,22
head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most,22
a woodcock too?,22
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the,22
said she 'a fine little one.' 'No' said I 'a,22
Nay' said I 'a good wit:' 'Just' said she 'it,22
is wise:' 'Certain' said she 'a wise gentleman.',22
believe' said she 'for he swore a thing to me on,22
there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus,22
virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou,22
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared,22
Yea that she did: but yet for all that an if she,22
the old man's daughter told us all.,22
hid in the garden.,22
the sensible Benedick's head?,22
married man'?,22
you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests,22
hurt not. My lord for your many courtesies I thank,22
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among,22
Lackbeard there he and I shall meet: and till,22
Exit,22
In most profound earnest; and I'll warrant you for,22
And hath challenged thee.,22
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his,22
He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a,22
But soft you let me be: pluck up my heart and,22
Enter DOGBERRY VERGES and the Watch with CONRADE and BORACHIO,22
shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,22
How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio,22
Hearken after their offence my lord.,22
Marry sir they have committed false report;,22
they are slanders; sixth and lastly they have,22
things; and to conclude they are lying knaves.,22
ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly why,22
to their charge.,22
my troth there's one meaning well suited.,22
bound to your answer? this learned constable is,22
Sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer:,22
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms,22
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing,22
to slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into,22
garments how you disgraced her when you should,22
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over,22
master's false accusation; and briefly I desire,22
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?,22
But did my brother set thee on to this?,22
He is composed and framed of treachery:,22
Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear,22
Come bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our,22
and masters do not forget to specify when time,22
Here here comes master Signior Leonato and the,22
Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO with the Sexton,22
That when I note another man like him,22
If you would know your wronger look on me.,22
Mine innocent child?,22
No not so villain; thou beliest thyself:,22
A third is fled that had a hand in it.,22
Record it with your high and worthy deeds:,22
I know not how to pray your patience;,22
Impose me to what penance your invention,22
But in mistaking.,22
And yet to satisfy this good old man,22
That he'll enjoin me to.,22
That were impossible: but I pray you both,22
How innocent she died; and if your love,22
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,22
To-morrow morning come you to my house,22
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,22
And she alone is heir to both of us:,22
And so dies my revenge.,22
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!,22
For henceforth of poor Claudio.,22
To-night I take my leave. This naughty man,22
Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,22
No by my soul she was not,22
But always hath been just and virtuous,22
Moreover sir which indeed is not under white and,22
me ass: I beseech you let it be remembered in his,22
one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and,22
name the which he hath used so long and never paid,22
for God's sake: pray you examine him upon that point.,22
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and,22
There's for thy pains.,22
Go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee.,22
beseech your worship to correct yourself for the,22
your worship well; God restore you to health! I,22
meeting may be wished God prohibit it! Come neighbour.,22
Until to-morrow morning lords farewell.,22
We will not fail.,22
[To the Watch]  Bring you these fellows on. We'll,22
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.,22
SCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.,22
Pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at,22
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?,22
shall come over it; for in most comely truth thou,22
To have no man come over me! why shall I always,22
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.,22
but hurt not.,22
woman: and so I pray thee call Beatrice: I give,22
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.,22
pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.,22
And therefore will come.,22
Sings,22
That sits above,22
How pitiful I deserve--,22
swimmer Troilus the first employer of panders and,22
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a,22
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry I,22
out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby' an innocent,22
school' 'fool' a babbling rhyme; very ominous,22
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.,22
Sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called thee?,22
O stay but till then!,22
I go let me go with that I came; which is with,22
Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.,22
foul breath and foul breath is noisome; therefore I,22
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,22
plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either,22
him a coward. And I pray thee now tell me for,22
For them all together; which maintained so politic,22
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my,22
Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love,22
In spite of your heart I think; alas poor heart!,22
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.,22
It appears not in this confession: there's not one,22
An old an old instance Beatrice that lived in,22
in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live,22
widow weeps.,22
Question: why an hour in clamour and a quarter in,22
wise if Don Worm his conscience find no,22
own virtues as I am to myself. So much for,22
praiseworthy: and now tell me how doth your cousin?,22
And how do you?,22
Serve God love me and mend. There will I leave,22
Enter URSULA,22
coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been,22
abused; and Don John is the author of all who is,22
Will you go hear this news signior?,22
buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with,22
Exeunt,22
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and three or four with tapers,22
It is my lord.,22
Done to death by slanderous tongues,22
Death in guerdon of her wrongs,22
So the life that died with shame,22
Hang thou there upon the tomb,22
Now music sound and sing your solemn hymn.,22
Pardon goddess of the night,22
For the which with songs of woe,22
Midnight assist our moan;,22
Heavily heavily:,22
Till death be uttered,22
Now unto thy bones good night!,22
Good morrow masters; put your torches out:,22
Before the wheels of Phoebus round about,22
Thanks to you all and leave us: fare you well.,22
Come let us hence and put on other weeds;,22
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's,22
Exeunt,22
Enter LEONATO ANTONIO BENEDICK BEATRICE MARGARET URSULA FRIAR FRANCIS and HERO,22
So are the prince and Claudio who accused her,22
But Margaret was in some fault for this,22
In the true course of all the question.,22
And so am I being else by faith enforced,22
Well daughter and you gentle-women all,22
And when I send for you come hither mask'd.,22
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour,22
You must be father to your brother's daughter,22
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.,22
To do what signior?,22
Signior Leonato truth it is good signior,22
That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.,22
The sight whereof I think you had from me,22
Your answer sir is enigmatical:,22
May stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd,22
In which good friar I shall desire your help.,22
And my help.,22
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO and two or three others,22
Good morrow prince; good morrow Claudio:,22
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?,22
Call her forth brother; here's the friar ready.,22
Good morrow Benedick. Why what's the matter,22
So full of frost of storm and cloudiness?,22
Tush fear not man; we'll tip thy horns with gold,22
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,22
Bull Jove sir had an amiable low;,22
And got a calf in that same noble feat,22
For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.,22
Which is the lady I must seize upon?,22
Why then she's mine. Sweet let me see your face.,22
Before this friar and swear to marry her.,22
I am your husband if you like of me.,22
Unmasking,22
Another Hero!,22
One Hero died defiled but I do live,22
The former Hero! Hero that is dead!,22
All this amazement can I qualify:,22
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:,22
And to the chapel let us presently.,22
[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?,22
Why no; no more than reason.,22
Have been deceived; they swore you did.,22
Troth no; no more than reason.,22
Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.,22
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.,22
No truly but in friendly recompense.,22
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;,22
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,22
And here's another,22
Containing her affection unto Benedick.,22
Come I will have thee; but by this light I take,22
I would not deny you; but by this good day I yield,22
for I was told you were in a consumption.,22
Kissing her,22
I'll tell thee what prince; a college of,22
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:,22
nothing handsome about him. In brief since I do,22
purpose that the world can say against it; and,22
against it; for man is a giddy thing and this is my,22
have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my,22
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,22
life to make thee a double-dealer; which out of,22
exceedingly narrowly to thee.,22
we are married that we may lighten our own hearts,22
We'll have dancing afterward.,22
thou art sad; get thee a wife get thee a wife:,22
Enter a Messenger,22
And brought with armed men back to Messina.,22
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.,22
Dance,22
ACT I,23
Enter RODERIGO and IAGO,23
That thou Iago who hast had my purse,23
Sblood but you will not hear me:,23
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.,23
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,23
I know my price I am worth no worse a place:,23
Evades them with a bombast circumstance,23
And in conclusion,23
I have already chose my officer.',23
Forsooth a great arithmetician,23
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;,23
Nor the division of a battle knows,23
Wherein the toged consuls can propose,23
Is all his soldiership. But he sir had the election:,23
At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds,23
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,23
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.,23
Why there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,23
And not by old gradation where each second,23
Whether I in any just term am affined,23
I would not follow him then.,23
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:,23
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark,23
That doting on his own obsequious bondage,23
For nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd:,23
Who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,23
And throwing but shows of service on their lords,23
their coats,23
And such a one do I profess myself. For sir,23
Were I the Moor I would not be Iago:,23
Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty,23
For when my outward action doth demonstrate,23
In compliment extern 'tis not long after,23
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.,23
If he can carry't thus!,23
Rouse him: make after him poison his delight,23
And though he in a fertile climate dwell,23
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,23
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.,23
As when by night and negligence the fire,23
What ho Brabantio! Signior Brabantio ho!,23
Look to your house your daughter and your bags!,23
BRABANTIO appears above at a window,23
What is the matter there?,23
Are your doors lock'd?,23
Zounds sir you're robb'd; for shame put on,23
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul;,23
Is topping your white ewe. Arise arise;,23
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:,23
What have you lost your wits?,23
Not I what are you?,23
The worser welcome:,23
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say,23
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,23
To start my quiet.,23
But thou must needs be sure,23
To make this bitter to thee.,23
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;,23
Most grave Brabantio,23
Zounds sir you are one of those that will not,23
do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll,23
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have,23
What profane wretch art thou?,23
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.,23
You are--a senator.,23
Sir I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,23
As partly I find it is that your fair daughter,23
Transported with no worse nor better guard,23
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--,23
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;,23
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe,23
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:,23
I say again hath made a gross revolt;,23
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger,23
If she be in her chamber or your house,23
For thus deluding you.,23
Give me a taper! call up all my people!,23
Belief of it oppresses me already.,23
Exit above,23
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place,23
Against the Moor: for I do know the state,23
Cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd,23
Which even now stand in act that for their souls,23
To lead their business: in which regard,23
Yet for necessity of present life,23
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,23
And there will I be with him. So farewell.,23
Enter below BRABANTIO and Servants with torches,23
And what's to come of my despised time,23
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!,23
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me,23
Raise all my kindred. Are they married think you?,23
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!,23
By what you see them act. Is there not charms,23
May be abused? Have you not read Roderigo,23
Yes sir I have indeed.,23
Some one way some another. Do you know,23
I think I can discover him if you please,23
Pray you lead on. At every house I'll call;,23
And raise some special officers of night.,23
Exeunt,23
Enter OTHELLO IAGO and Attendants with torches,23
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience,23
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times,23
Tis better as it is.,23
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms,23
That with the little godliness I have,23
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,23
And hath in his effect a voice potential,23
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance,23
Will give him cable.,23
My services which I have done the signiory,23
Which when I know that boasting is an honour,23
From men of royal siege and my demerits,23
As this that I have reach'd: for know Iago,23
I would not my unhoused free condition,23
For the sea's worth. But look! what lights come yond?,23
You were best go in.,23
My parts my title and my perfect soul,23
By Janus I think no.,23
The servants of the duke and my lieutenant.,23
What is the news?,23
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,23
What is the matter think you?,23
It is a business of some heat: the galleys,23
This very night at one another's heels,23
Are at the duke's already: you have been,23
When being not at your lodging to be found,23
To search you out.,23
I will but spend a word here in the house,23
Exit,23
Faith he to-night hath boarded a land carack:,23
I do not understand.,23
To who?,23
Marry to--Come captain will you go?,23
Here comes another troop to seek for you.,23
He comes to bad intent.,23
Holla! stand there!,23
Down with him thief!,23
You Roderigo! come sir I am for you.,23
Good signior you shall more command with years,23
O thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter?,23
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,23
Whether a maid so tender fair and happy,23
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,23
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom,23
Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense,23
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals,23
Tis probable and palpable to thinking.,23
For an abuser of the world a practiser,23
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,23
Hold your hands,23
Were it my cue to fight I should have known it,23
To answer this your charge?,23
Of law and course of direct session,23
What if I do obey?,23
Whose messengers are here about my side,23
To bring me to him?,23
The duke's in council and your noble self,23
How! the duke in council!,23
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,23
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;,23
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.,23
SCENE III. A council-chamber.,23
There is no composition in these news,23
Indeed they are disproportion'd;,23
And mine a hundred and forty.,23
But though they jump not on a just account--,23
Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm,23
Nay it is possible enough to judgment:,23
But the main article I do approve,23
[Within]  What ho! what ho! what ho!,23
Enter a Sailor,23
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;,23
By Signior Angelo.,23
This cannot be,23
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider,23
And let ourselves again but understand,23
So may he with more facile question bear it,23
But altogether lacks the abilities,23
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful,23
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,23
Nay in all confidence he's not for Rhodes.,23
Enter a Messenger,23
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,23
Ay so I thought. How many as you guess?,23
Their backward course bearing with frank appearance,23
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,23
And prays you to believe him.,23
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town?,23
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.,23
Enter BRABANTIO OTHELLO IAGO RODERIGO and Officers,23
Against the general enemy Ottoman.,23
I did not see you; welcome gentle signior;,23
So did I yours. Good your grace pardon me;,23
Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care,23
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature,23
And it is still itself.,23
My daughter! O my daughter!,23
Ay to me;,23
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;,23
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense,23
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding,23
And you of her the bloody book of law,23
After your own sense yea though our proper son,23
Humbly I thank your grace.,23
Your special mandate for the state-affairs,23
We are very sorry for't.,23
Nothing but this is so.,23
My very noble and approved good masters,23
It is most true; true I have married her:,23
Hath this extent no more. Rude am I in my speech,23
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,23
Their dearest action in the tented field,23
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,23
In speaking for myself. Yet by your gracious patience,23
Of my whole course of love; what drugs what charms,23
For such proceeding I am charged withal,23
A maiden never bold;,23
Blush'd at herself; and she in spite of nature,23
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!,23
That will confess perfection so could err,23
To find out practises of cunning hell,23
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,23
He wrought upon her.,23
Without more wider and more overt test,23
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.,23
Did you by indirect and forced courses,23
Or came it by request and such fair question,23
I do beseech you,23
And let her speak of me before her father:,23
The trust the office I do hold of you,23
Even fall upon my life.,23
Ancient conduct them: you best know the place.,23
And till she come as truly as to heaven,23
So justly to your grave ears I'll present,23
And she in mine.,23
Her father loved me; oft invited me;,23
From year to year the battles sieges fortunes,23
I ran it through even from my boyish days,23
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,23
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,23
And sold to slavery of my redemption thence,23
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,23
It was my hint to speak--such was the process;,23
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads,23
Would Desdemona seriously incline:,23
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,23
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,23
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,23
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,23
And often did beguile her of her tears,23
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,23
She swore in faith twas strange 'twas passing strange,23
She wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd,23
And bade me if I had a friend that loved her,23
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:,23
And I loved her that she did pity them.,23
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.,23
I think this tale would win my daughter too.,23
Take up this mangled matter at the best:,23
Than their bare hands.,23
If she confess that she was half the wooer,23
Light on the man! Come hither gentle mistress:,23
Where most you owe obedience?,23
I do perceive here a divided duty:,23
My life and education both do learn me,23
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,23
To you preferring you before her father,23
Due to the Moor my lord.,23
Please it your grace on to the state-affairs:,23
Come hither Moor:,23
Which but thou hast already with all my heart,23
I am glad at soul I have no other child:,23
To hang clogs on them. I have done my lord.,23
Which as a grise or step may help these lovers,23
When remedies are past the griefs are ended,23
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone,23
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,23
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;,23
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;,23
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears,23
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow,23
These sentences to sugar or to gall,23
But words are words; I never yet did hear,23
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state.,23
Cyprus. Othello the fortitude of the place is best,23
of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a,23
voice on you: you must therefore be content to,23
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.,23
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war,23
A natural and prompt alacrity,23
These present wars against the Ottomites.,23
I crave fit disposition for my wife.,23
With such accommodation and besort,23
If you please,23
I'll not have it so.,23
Nor I; I would not there reside,23
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,23
And let me find a charter in your voice,23
What would You Desdemona?,23
My downright violence and storm of fortunes,23
Even to the very quality of my lord:,23
And to his honour and his valiant parts,23
So that dear lords if I be left behind,23
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,23
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.,23
Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not,23
Nor to comply with heat--the young affects,23
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:,23
I will your serious and great business scant,23
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness,23
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,23
And all indign and base adversities,23
Be it as you shall privately determine,23
And speed must answer it.,23
With all my heart.,23
Othello leave some officer behind,23
With such things else of quality and respect,23
So please your grace my ancient;,23
To his conveyance I assign my wife,23
To be sent after me.,23
Good night to every one.,23
And noble signior,23
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.,23
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see:,23
Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE Senators Officers  and c,23
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:,23
And bring them after in the best advantage.,23
Of love of worldly matters and direction,23
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA,23
What say'st thou noble heart?,23
Why go to bed and sleep.,23
If thou dost I shall never love thee after. Why,23
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and,23
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four,23
betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man,23
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen I,23
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so,23
Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus,23
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant,23
thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or,23
with idleness or manured with industry why the,23
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one,23
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us,23
reason to cool our raging motions our carnal,23
you call love to be a sect or scion.,23
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of,23
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy,23
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never,23
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with,23
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her,23
his to her: it was a violent commencement and thou,23
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in,23
that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be,23
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,23
have change she must: therefore put money in thy,23
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money,23
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not,23
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of,23
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than,23
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on,23
Thou art sure of me:--go make money:--I have told,23
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no,23
against him: if thou canst cuckold him thou dost,23
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.,23
of this to-morrow. Adieu.,23
At my lodging.,23
Go to; farewell. Do you hear Roderigo?,23
No more of drowning do you hear?,23
Exit,23
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,23
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:,23
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;,23
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;,23
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:,23
In double knavery--How how? Let's see:--,23
That he is too familiar with his wife.,23
To be suspected framed to make women false.,23
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,23
As asses are.,23
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.,23
ACT II,23
Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen,23
Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;,23
Descry a sail.,23
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:,23
What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them,23
A segregation of the Turkish fleet:,23
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;,23
seems to cast water on the burning bear,23
I never did like molestation view,23
If that the Turkish fleet,23
It is impossible they bear it out.,23
News lads! our wars are done.,23
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice,23
On most part of their fleet.,23
The ship is here put in,23
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,23
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.,23
But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort,23
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted,23
Pray heavens he be;,23
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside ho!,23
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,23
An indistinct regard.,23
For every minute is expectancy,23
Enter CASSIO,23
That so approve the Moor! O let the heavens,23
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.,23
His bark is stoutly timber'd his pilot,23
Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death,23
A cry within 'A sail a sail a sail!',23
What noise?,23
Stand ranks of people and they cry 'A sail!',23
Guns heard,23
Our friends at least.,23
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.,23
Exit,23
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid,23
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,23
Does tire the ingener.,23
How now! who has put in?,23
Has had most favourable and happy speed:,23
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--,23
As having sense of beauty do omit,23
The divine Desdemona.,23
She that I spake of our great captain's captain,23
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts,23
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,23
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,23
And bring all Cyprus comfort!,23
O behold,23
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees.,23
Before behind thee and on every hand,23
I thank you valiant Cassio.,23
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught,23
O but I fear--How lost you company?,23
Parted our fellowship--But hark! a sail.,23
They give their greeting to the citadel;,23
See for the news.,23
Good ancient you are welcome.,23
Welcome mistress.,23
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding,23
Kissing her,23
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,23
Alas she has no speech.,23
I find it still when I have list to sleep:,23
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,23
You have little cause to say so.,23
Bells in your parlors wild-cats in your kitchens,23
Players in your housewifery and housewives' in your beds.,23
Nay it is true or else I am a Turk:,23
You shall not write my praise.,23
What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst,23
O gentle lady do not put me to't;,23
Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?,23
I am not merry; but I do beguile,23
Come how wouldst thou praise me?,23
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;,23
And thus she is deliver'd.,23
The one's for use the other useth it.,23
If she be black and thereto have a wit,23
Worse and worse.,23
She never yet was foolish that was fair;,23
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i',23
her that's foul and foolish?,23
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.,23
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving,23
merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?,23
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,23
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may',23
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,23
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;,23
See suitors following and not look behind,23
To do what?,23
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn,23
you Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal,23
He speaks home madam: You may relish him more in,23
[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay well said,23
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay smile upon,23
You say true; 'tis so indeed: if such tricks as,23
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so,23
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent,23
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!,23
The Moor! I know his trumpet.,23
Let's meet him and receive him.,23
Enter OTHELLO and Attendants,23
My dear Othello!,23
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!,23
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!,23
Olympus-high and duck again as low,23
Twere now to be most happy; for I fear,23
That not another comfort like to this,23
The heavens forbid,23
Even as our days do grow!,23
I cannot speak enough of this content;,23
And this and this the greatest discords be,23
That e'er our hearts shall make!,23
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,23
Come let us to the castle.,23
are drown'd.,23
Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus;,23
I prattle out of fashion and I dote,23
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:,23
He is a good one and his worthiness,23
Once more well met at Cyprus.,23
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come,23
men being in love have then a nobility in their,23
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of,23
directly in love with him.,23
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed.,23
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:,23
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;,23
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of,23
give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour,23
the Moor is defective in: now for want of these,23
find itself abused begin to heave the gorge,23
instruct her in it and compel her to some second,23
pregnant and unforced position--who stands so,23
does? a knave very voluble; no further,23
civil and humane seeming for the better compassing,23
none; why none: a slipper and subtle knave a,23
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never,23
knave is handsome young and hath all those,23
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman,23
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of,23
Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of,23
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou,23
not mark that?,23
Lechery by this hand; an index and obscure prologue,23
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced,23
mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes,23
conclusion Pish! But sir be you ruled by me: I,23
for the command I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows,23
some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking,23
other course you please which the time shall more,23
Well.,23
may strike at you: provoke him that he may; for,23
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true,23
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by,23
impediment most profitably removed without the,23
I will do this if I can bring it to any,23
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:,23
Adieu.,23
That Cassio loves her I do well believe it;,23
The Moor howbeit that I endure him not,23
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona,23
Not out of absolute lust though peradventure,23
But partly led to diet my revenge,23
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof,23
And nothing can or shall content my soul,23
Or failing so yet that I put the Moor,23
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,23
For his quick hunting stand the putting on,23
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--,23
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me.,23
And practising upon his peace and quiet,23
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.,23
SCENE II. A street.,23
It is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiant,23
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,23
some to make bonfires each man to what sport and,23
beneficial news it is the celebration of his,23
proclaimed. All offices are open and there is full,23
till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the,23
Exeunt,23
Enter OTHELLO DESDEMONA CASSIO and Attendants,23
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,23
Iago hath direction what to do;,23
Will I look to't.,23
Michael good night: to-morrow with your earliest,23
To DESDEMONA,23
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue;,23
Good night.,23
Enter IAGO,23
Not this hour lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the,23
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:,23
she is sport for Jove.,23
And I'll warrant her fun of game.,23
What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of,23
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.,23
She is indeed perfection.,23
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace,23
the health of black Othello.,23
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish,23
entertainment.,23
you.,23
craftily qualified too and behold what innovation,23
and dare not task my weakness with any more.,23
desire it.,23
Here at the door; I pray you call them in.,23
Exit,23
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,23
As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,23
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused,23
Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits,23
The very elements of this warlike isle,23
And they watch too. Now 'mongst this flock of drunkards,23
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:,23
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.,23
Fore God they have given me a rouse already.,23
a soldier.,23
Sings,23
And let me the canakin clink,23
A life's but a span;,23
Some wine boys!,23
I learned it in England where indeed they are,23
your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink ho!--are nothing,23
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?,23
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he,23
can be filled.,23
I am for it lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.,23
King Stephen was a worthy peer,23
He held them sixpence all too dear,23
He was a wight of high renown,23
Tis pride that pulls the country down;,23
Some wine ho!,23
Will you hear't again?,23
does those things. Well God's above all; and there,23
It's true good lieutenant.,23
any man of quality--I hope to be saved.,23
Ay but by your leave not before me; the,23
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive,23
Do not think gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my,23
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough and,23
Excellent well.,23
Exit,23
You see this fellow that is gone before;,23
And give direction: and do but see his vice;,23
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.,23
On some odd time of his infirmity,23
But is he often thus?,23
He'll watch the horologe a double set,23
It were well,23
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature,23
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?,23
[Aside to him]  How now Roderigo!,23
Exit RODERIGO,23
Should hazard such a place as his own second,23
It were an honest action to say,23
Not I for this fair island:,23
To cure him of this evil--But hark! what noise?,23
Re-enter CASSIO driving in RODERIGO,23
What's the matter lieutenant?,23
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.,23
Dost thou prate rogue?,23
Nay good lieutenant;,23
I pray you sir hold your hand.,23
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.,23
you're drunk.,23
They fight,23
Exit RODERIGO,23
Help ho!--Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir;,23
Bell rings,23
The town will rise: God's will lieutenant hold!,23
Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants,23
Zounds I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.,23
Hold for your lives!,23
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?,23
Why how now ho! from whence ariseth this?,23
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?,23
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage,23
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle,23
Honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving,23
I do not know: friends all but now even now,23
Devesting them for bed; and then but now--,23
Swords out and tilting one at other's breast,23
Any beginning to this peevish odds;,23
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!,23
I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.,23
The gravity and stillness of your youth,23
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,23
And spend your rich opinion for the name,23
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger:,23
While I spare speech which something now,23
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught,23
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,23
When violence assails us.,23
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;,23
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,23
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know,23
And he that is approved in this offence,23
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,23
To manage private and domestic quarrel,23
Tis monstrous. Iago who began't?,23
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,23
Touch me not so near:,23
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;,23
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is general.,23
There comes a fellow crying out for help:,23
To execute upon him. Sir this gentleman,23
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,23
The town might fall in fright: he swift of foot,23
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,23
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--,23
At blow and thrust; even as again they were,23
More of this matter cannot I report:,23
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,23
Yet surely Cassio I believe received,23
Which patience could not pass.,23
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,23
But never more be officer of mine.,23
Look if my gentle love be not raised up!,23
What's the matter?,23
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon:,23
To MONTANO who is led off,23
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.,23
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.,23
What are you hurt lieutenant?,23
Marry heaven forbid!,23
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of,23
Iago my reputation!,23
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than,23
imposition: oft got without merit and lost without,23
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What man!,23
are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in,23
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue,23
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so,23
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?,23
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible,23
let us call thee devil!,23
had he done to you?,23
Is't possible?,23
a quarrel but nothing wherefore. O God that men,23
their brains! that we should with joy pleasance,23
Why but you are now well enough: how came you thus,23
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place,23
another to make me frankly despise myself.,23
the place and the condition of this country,23
but since it is as it is mend it for your own good.,23
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,23
sensible man by and by a fool and presently a,23
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.,23
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.,23
I have well approved it sir. I drunk!,23
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife,23
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the,23
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune,23
so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition,23
than she is requested: this broken joint between,23
fortunes against any lay worth naming this,23
You advise me well.,23
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will,23
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.,23
must to the watch.,23
Exit,23
When this advice is free I give and honest,23
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy,23
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful,23
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,23
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,23
Even as her appetite shall play the god,23
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,23
When devils will the blackest sins put on,23
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool,23
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,23
That she repeals him for her body's lust;,23
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.,23
And out of her own goodness make the net,23
Re-enter RODERIGO,23
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that,23
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well,23
have so much experience for my pains and so with,23
How poor are they that have not patience!,23
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft;,23
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.,23
Though other things grow fair against the sun,23
Content thyself awhile. By the mass 'tis morning;,23
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:,23
Nay get thee gone.,23
Two things are to be done:,23
I'll set her on;,23
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find,23
Dull not device by coldness and delay.,23
ACT III,23
Enter CASSIO and some Musicians,23
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow general.',23
Enter Clown,23
that they speak i' the nose thus?,23
Are these I pray you wind-instruments?,23
O thereby hangs a tail.,23
Marry. sir by many a wind-instrument that I know.,23
so likes your music that he desires you for love's,23
Well sir we will not.,23
again: but as they say to hear music the general,23
We have none such sir.,23
go; vanish into air; away!,23
Dost thou hear my honest friend?,23
Prithee keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece,23
the general's wife be stirring tell her there's,23
wilt thou do this?,23
shall seem to notify unto her.,23
Exit Clown,23
In happy time Iago.,23
Why no; the day had broke,23
To send in to your wife: my suit to her,23
Procure me some access.,23
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor,23
May be more free.,23
Exit IAGO,23
A Florentine more kind and honest.,23
Good morrow good Lieutenant: I am sorry,23
The general and his wife are talking of it;,23
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,23
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,23
To take the safest occasion by the front,23
Yet I beseech you,23
Give me advantage of some brief discourse,23
Pray you come in;,23
To speak your bosom freely.,23
Exeunt,23
Enter OTHELLO IAGO and Gentlemen,23
And by him do my duties to the senate:,23
Repair there to me.,23
This fortification gentlemen shall we see't?,23
Exeunt,23
Enter DESDEMONA CASSIO and EMILIA,23
All my abilities in thy behalf.,23
As if the case were his.,23
But I will have my lord and you again,23
Bounteous madam,23
He's never any thing but your true servant.,23
You have known him long; and be you well assured,23
Than in a polite distance.,23
That policy may either last so long,23
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,23
My general will forget my love and service.,23
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,23
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;,23
His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift;,23
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry Cassio;,23
Than give thy cause away.,23
Madam I'll take my leave.,23
Madam not now: I am very ill at ease,23
Well do your discretion.,23
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO,23
What dost thou say?,23
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?,23
That he would steal away so guilty-like,23
I do believe 'twas he.,23
I have been talking with a suitor here,23
Who is't you mean?,23
If I have any grace or power to move you,23
For if he be not one that truly loves you,23
I have no judgment in an honest face:,23
Went he hence now?,23
That he hath left part of his grief with me,23
Not now sweet Desdemona; some other time.,23
The sooner sweet for you.,23
No not to-night.,23
I shall not dine at home;,23
Why then to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;,23
I prithee name the time but let it not,23
And yet his trespass in our common reason--,23
Out of their best--is not almost a fault,23
Tell me Othello: I wonder in my soul,23
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,23
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,23
To bring him in! Trust me I could do much--,23
I will deny thee nothing.,23
Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,23
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit,23
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,23
And fearful to be granted.,23
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this,23
Shall I deny you? no: farewell my lord.,23
Emilia come. Be as your fancies teach you;,23
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA,23
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,23
My noble lord--,23
Did Michael Cassio when you woo'd my lady,23
He did from first to last: why dost thou ask?,23
No further harm.,23
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.,23
Indeed!,23
Is he not honest?,23
Honest! ay honest.,23
What dost thou think?,23
Think my lord!,23
As if there were some monster in his thought,23
I heard thee say even now thou likedst not that,23
And when I told thee he was of my counsel,23
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,23
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,23
My lord you know I love you.,23
And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,23
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:,23
Are tricks of custom but in a man that's just,23
That passion cannot rule.,23
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.,23
Men should be what they seem;,23
Certain men should be what they seem.,23
Nay yet there's more in this:,23
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts,23
Good my lord pardon me:,23
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.,23
As where's that palace whereinto foul things,23
But some uncleanly apprehensions,23
With meditations lawful?,23
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear,23
I do beseech you--,23
As I confess it is my nature's plague,23
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,23
Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble,23
It were not for your quiet nor your good,23
To let you know my thoughts.,23
Good name in man and woman dear my lord,23
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something nothing;,23
But he that filches from me my good name,23
And makes me poor indeed.,23
You cannot if my heart were in your hand;,23
Ha!,23
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock,23
Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger;,23
Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves!,23
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,23
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.,23
From jealousy!,23
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,23
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt,23
When I shall turn the business of my soul,23
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous,23
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well;,23
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw,23
For she had eyes and chose me. No Iago;,23
And on the proof there is no more but this--,23
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason,23
With franker spirit: therefore as I am bound,23
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;,23
I would not have your free and noble nature,23
I know our country disposition well;,23
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience,23
Dost thou say so?,23
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,23
And so she did.,23
She that so young could give out such a seeming,23
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;,23
For too much loving you.,23
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.,23
I' faith I fear it has.,23
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:,23
To grosser issues nor to larger reach,23
I will not.,23
My speech should fall into such vile success,23
My lord I see you're moved.,23
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.,23
And yet how nature erring from itself--,23
Not to affect many proposed matches,23
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--,23
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.,23
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,23
May fall to match you with her country forms,23
Farewell farewell:,23
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me Iago:,23
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless,23
[Returning]  My lord I would I might entreat,23
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:,23
For sure he fills it up with great ability,23
You shall by that perceive him and his means:,23
With any strong or vehement importunity;,23
Let me be thought too busy in my fears--,23
And hold her free I do beseech your honour.,23
I once more take my leave.,23
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,23
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,23
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,23
And have not those soft parts of conversation,23
Into the vale of years--yet that's not much--,23
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,23
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,23
Than keep a corner in the thing I love,23
Prerogatived are they less than the base;,23
Even then this forked plague is fated to us,23
Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA,23
I'll not believe't.,23
Your dinner and the generous islanders,23
I am to blame.,23
Are you not well?,23
Faith that's with watching; 'twill away again:,23
It will be well.,23
He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops,23
I am very sorry that you are not well.,23
I am glad I have found this napkin:,23
My wayward husband hath a hundred times,23
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,23
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,23
Heaven knows not I;,23
Re-enter Iago,23
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.,23
Ha!,23
O is that all? What will you give me now,23
What handkerchief?,23
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;,23
Hast stol'n it from her?,23
And to the advantage I being here took't up.,23
A good wench; give it me.,23
so earnest,23
[Snatching it]  Why what's that to you?,23
Give't me again: poor lady she'll run mad,23
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.,23
Exit EMILIA,23
And let him find it. Trifles light as air,23
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.,23
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons.,23
But with a little act upon the blood.,23
Look where he comes!,23
Not poppy nor mandragora,23
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep,23
Ha! ha! false to me?,23
Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:,23
Than but to know't a little.,23
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?,23
I slept the next night well was free and merry;,23
He that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n,23
I am sorry to hear this.,23
Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body,23
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!,23
That make ambition virtue! O farewell!,23
The spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fife,23
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war!,23
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,23
Is't possible my lord?,23
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:,23
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog,23
Is't come to this?,23
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop,23
My noble lord--,23
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;,23
Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed;,23
Greater than that.,23
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?,23
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!,23
To be direct and honest is not safe.,23
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence.,23
I should be wise for honesty's a fool,23
By the world,23
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.,23
As Dian's visage is now begrimed and black,23
Poison or fire or suffocating streams,23
I see sir you are eaten up with passion:,23
You would be satisfied?,23
And may: but how? how satisfied my lord?,23
Behold her topp'd?,23
It were a tedious difficulty I think,23
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster,23
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?,23
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys,23
As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,23
Which lead directly to the door of truth,23
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.,23
But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,23
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;,23
I could not sleep.,23
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:,23
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,23
And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand,23
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,23
Over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then,23
O monstrous! monstrous!,23
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:,23
And this may help to thicken other proofs,23
I'll tear her all to pieces.,23
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,23
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?,23
I know not that; but such a handkerchief--,23
See Cassio wipe his beard with.,23
If it be that or any that was hers,23
O that the slave had forty thousand lives!,23
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here Iago;,23
Tis gone.,23
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne,23
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!,23
O blood blood blood!,23
Never Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,23
Ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on,23
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace,23
Till that a capable and wide revenge,23
Kneels,23
I here engage my words.,23
Kneels,23
You elements that clip us round about,23
The execution of his wit hands heart,23
And to obey shall be in me remorse,23
They rise,23
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous,23
Within these three days let me hear thee say,23
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:,23
Damn her lewd minx! O damn her!,23
To furnish me with some swift means of death,23
I am your own for ever.,23
SCENE IV. Before the castle.,23
Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies?,23
Why man?,23
is stabbing.,23
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.,23
I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a,23
to lie in mine own throat.,23
I will catechise the world for him; that is make,23
Seek him bid him come hither: tell him I have,23
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and,23
Exit,23
I know not madam.,23
Full of crusadoes: and but my noble Moor,23
As jealous creatures are it were enough,23
Is he not jealous?,23
Drew all such humours from him.,23
I will not leave him now till Cassio,23
Enter OTHELLO,23
Well my good lady.,23
O hardness to dissemble!--,23
Well my good lord.,23
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.,23
Hot hot and moist: this hand of yours requires,23
Much castigation exercise devout;,23
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,23
You may indeed say so;,23
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;,23
I cannot speak of this. Come now your promise.,23
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.,23
Lend me thy handkerchief.,23
That which I gave you.,23
Not?,23
That is a fault.,23
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;,23
The thoughts of people: she told her while,23
Twould make her amiable and subdue my father,23
Or made gift of it my father's eye,23
After new fancies: she dying gave it me;,23
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;,23
To lose't or give't away were such perdition,23
Is't possible?,23
A sibyl that had number'd in the world,23
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;,23
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful,23
Indeed! is't true?,23
Then would to God that I had never seen't!,23
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?,23
o' the way?,23
Say you?,23
How!,23
Fetch't let me see't.,23
This is a trick to put me from my suit:,23
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.,23
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.,23
I pray talk me of Cassio.,23
A man that all his time,23
Shared dangers with you--,23
In sooth you are to blame.,23
Exit,23
I ne'er saw this before.,23
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.,23
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;,23
They belch us. Look you Cassio and my husband!,23
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:,23
How now good Cassio! what's the news with you?,23
That by your virtuous means I may again,23
Whom I with all the office of my heart,23
If my offence be of such mortal kind,23
Nor purposed merit in futurity,23
But to know so must be my benefit;,23
And shut myself up in some other course,23
Alas thrice-gentle Cassio!,23
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,23
So help me every spirit sanctified,23
And stood within the blank of his displeasure,23
What I can do I will; and more I will,23
Is my lord angry?,23
And certainly in strange unquietness.,23
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,23
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?,23
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.,23
Exit IAGO,23
Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practise,23
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases,23
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;,23
Our other healthful members even to that sense,23
Nor of them look for such observances,23
I was unhandsome warrior as I am,23
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,23
Pray heaven it be state-matters as you think,23
Concerning you.,23
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;,23
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster,23
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!,23
I will go seek him. Cassio walk hereabout:,23
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.,23
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA,23
Save you friend Cassio!,23
How is it with you my most fair Bianca?,23
And I was going to your lodging Cassio.,23
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,23
O weary reckoning!,23
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:,23
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,23
Take me this work out.,23
This is some token from a newer friend:,23
Is't come to this? Well well.,23
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,23
That this is from some mistress some remembrance:,23
Why whose is it?,23
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--,23
Take it and do't; and leave me for this time.,23
I do attend here on the general;,23
To have him see me woman'd.,23
Not that I love you not.,23
I pray you bring me on the way a little,23
Tis but a little way that I can bring you;,23
Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.,23
ACT IV,23
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO,23
Think so Iago!,23
To kiss in private?,23
Or to be naked with her friend in bed,23
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm!,23
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,23
So they do nothing 'tis a venial slip:,23
What then?,23
She may I think bestow't on any man.,23
May she give that?,23
They have it very oft that have it not:,23
By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it.,23
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,23
Ay what of that?,23
What,23
Or heard him say--as knaves be such abroad,23
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,23
But they must blab--,23
He hath my lord; but be you well assured,23
What hath he said?,23
What? what?,23
With her?,23
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her when,23
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To,23
hanged and then to confess.--I tremble at it.,23
passion without some instruction. It is not words,23
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--,23
Work on,23
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,23
My lord I say! Othello!,23
How now Cassio!,23
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:,23
Rub him about the temples.,23
The lethargy must have his quiet course:,23
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:,23
He will recover straight: when he is gone,23
Exit CASSIO,23
Dost thou mock me?,23
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!,23
There's many a beast then in a populous city,23
Did he confess it?,23
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked,23
That nightly lie in those unproper beds,23
O 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch-mock,23
And to suppose her chaste! No let me know;,23
O thou art wise; 'tis certain.,23
Confine yourself but in a patient list.,23
A passion most unsuiting such a man--,23
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,23
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,23
That dwell in every region of his face;,23
Where how how oft how long ago and when,23
I say but mark his gesture. Marry patience;,23
And nothing of a man.,23
I will be found most cunning in my patience;,23
That's not amiss;,23
OTHELLO retires,23
A housewife that by selling her desires,23
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague,23
He when he hears of her cannot refrain,23
Re-enter CASSIO,23
And his unbookish jealousy must construe,23
Quite in the wrong. How do you now lieutenant?,23
Whose want even kills me.,23
Speaking lower,23
How quickly should you speed!,23
Look how he laughs already!,23
Alas poor rogue! I think i' faith she loves me.,23
Do you hear Cassio?,23
To tell it o'er: go to; well said well said.,23
Do you intend it?,23
Do you triumph Roman? do you triumph?,23
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.,23
So so so so: they laugh that win.,23
Prithee say true.,23
Have you scored me? Well.,23
persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and,23
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.,23
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with,23
and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck--,23
imports it.,23
and pulls me: ha ha ha!,23
I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall,23
Well I must leave her company.,23
Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.,23
What do you mean by this haunting of me?,23
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?,23
work?--A likely piece of work that you should find,23
This is some minx's token and I must take out the,23
you had it I'll take out no work on't.,23
By heaven that should be my handkerchief!,23
will not come when you are next prepared for.,23
After her after her.,23
Will you sup there?,23
Well I may chance to see you; for I would very fain,23
Prithee come; will you?,23
Exit CASSIO,23
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?,23
And did you see the handkerchief?,23
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the,23
hath given it his whore.,23
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!,23
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned to-night;,23
stone; I strike it and it hurts my hand. O the,23
an emperor's side and command him tasks.,23
Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate,23
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high,23
She's the worse for all this.,23
gentle a condition!,23
Nay that's certain: but yet the pity of it Iago!,23
If you are so fond over her iniquity give her,23
near nobody.,23
O 'tis foul in her.,23
That's fouler.,23
expostulate with her lest her body and beauty,23
Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even,23
Good good: the justice of it pleases: very good.,23
shall hear more by midnight.,23
A trumpet within,23
Something from Venice sure. 'Tis Lodovico,23
Enter LODOVICO DESDEMONA and Attendants,23
With all my heart sir.,23
Gives him a letter,23
Opens the letter and reads,23
I am very glad to see you signior,23
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?,23
Cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord,23
Are you sure of that?,23
[Reads]  'This fail you not to do as you will--',23
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?,23
To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio.,23
My lord?,23
What is he angry?,23
For as I think they do command him home,23
Trust me I am glad on't.,23
My lord?,23
Why sweet Othello--,23
I have not deserved this.,23
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:,23
O devil devil!,23
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.,23
I will not stay to offend you.,23
Truly an obedient lady:,23
Mistress!,23
What would you with her sir?,23
Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:,23
And turn again; and she can weep sir weep;,23
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.,23
I am commanded home. Get you away;,23
And will return to Venice. Hence avaunt!,23
Cassio shall have my place. And sir tonight,23
You are welcome sir to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!,23
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate,23
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue,23
Could neither graze nor pierce?,23
Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?,23
What he might be: if what he might he is not,23
What strike his wife!,23
That stroke would prove the worst!,23
Or did the letters work upon his blood,23
Alas alas!,23
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,23
That I may save my speech: do but go after,23
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.,23
SCENE II. A room in the castle.,23
You have seen nothing then?,23
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together.,23
Each syllable that breath made up between them.,23
Never my lord.,23
Never.,23
Never my lord.,23
I durst my lord to wager she is honest,23
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.,23
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!,23
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives,23
Bid her come hither: go.,23
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd,23
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets,23
Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA,23
Pray chuck come hither.,23
Let me see your eyes;,23
What horrible fancy's this?,23
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;,23
Your mystery your mystery: nay dispatch.,23
Upon my knees what doth your speech import?,23
But not the words.,23
Your wife my lord; your true,23
Come swear it damn thyself,23
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:,23
Heaven doth truly know it.,23
To whom my lord? with whom? how am I false?,23
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?,23
If haply you my father do suspect,23
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,23
Had it pleased heaven,23
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.,23
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,23
A drop of patience: but alas to make me,23
To point his slow unmoving finger at!,23
But there where I have garner'd up my heart,23
The fountain from the which my current runs,23
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads,23
Patience thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin--,23
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.,23
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,23
That the sense aches at thee would thou hadst,23
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed?,23
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!,23
I should make very forges of my cheeks,23
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!,23
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets,23
And will not hear it. What committed!,23
By heaven you do me wrong.,23
No as I am a Christian:,23
From any other foul unlawful touch,23
What not a whore?,23
Is't possible?,23
I cry you mercy then:,23
That married with Othello.,23
You mistress,23
And keep the gate of hell!,23
You you ay you!,23
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.,23
Alas what does this gentleman conceive?,23
Faith half asleep.,23
With who?,23
Who is thy lord?,23
I have none: do not talk to me Emilia;,23
But what should go by water. Prithee tonight,23
And call thy husband hither.,23
Exit,23
How have I been behaved that he might stick,23
Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO,23
How is't with you?,23
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:,23
I am a child to chiding.,23
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her.,23
As true hearts cannot bear.,23
What name fair lady?,23
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink,23
Why did he so?,23
Do not weep do not weep. Alas the day!,23
Her father and her country and her friends,23
It is my wretched fortune.,23
How comes this trick upon him?,23
I will be hang'd if some eternal villain,23
Some cogging cozening slave to get some office,23
Fie there is no such man; it is impossible.,23
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!,23
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?,23
Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow.,23
And put in every honest hand a whip,23
Even from the east to the west!,23
O fie upon them! Some such squire he was,23
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.,23
O good Iago,23
Good friend go to him; for by this light of heaven,23
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,23
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense,23
Or that I do not yet and ever did.,23
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,23
And his unkindness may defeat my life,23
It does abhor me now I speak the word;,23
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.,23
The business of the state does him offence,23
If 'twere no other--,23
Trumpets within,23
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;,23
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA,23
How now Roderigo!,23
What in the contrary?,23
and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me,23
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure,23
already I have foolishly suffered.,23
Faith I have heard too much for your words and,23
You charge me most unjustly.,23
my means. The jewels you have had from me to,23
votarist: you have told me she hath received them,23
respect and acquaintance but I find none.,23
Very well! go to! I cannot go to man; nor 'tis,23
to find myself fobbed in it.,23
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself,23
jewels I will give over my suit and repent my,23
will seek satisfaction of you.,23
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.,23
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than,23
taken against me a most just exception; but yet I,23
It hath not appeared.,23
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,23
have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean,23
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,23
engines for my life.,23
Sir there is especial commission come from Venice,23
Is that true? why then Othello and Desdemona,23
O no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with,23
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be,23
How do you mean removing of him?,23
knocking out his brains.,23
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.,23
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable,23
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,23
to second your attempt and he shall fall between,23
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death,23
him. It is now high suppertime and the night grows,23
I will hear further reason for this.,23
Exeunt,23
Enter OTHELLO LODOVICO DESDEMONA EMILIA and Attendants,23
O pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.,23
Your honour is most welcome.,23
O--Desdemona--,23
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned,23
I will my lord.,23
How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.,23
He hath commanded me to go to bed,23
Dismiss me!,23
Give me my nightly wearing and adieu:,23
I would you had never seen him!,23
That even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns--,23
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.,23
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me,23
Come come you talk.,23
She was in love and he she loved proved mad,23
An old thing 'twas but it express'd her fortune,23
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,23
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee dispatch.,23
No unpin me here.,23
A very handsome man.,23
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot,23
[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,23
Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee,23
The fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans;,23
Her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones;,23
Singing,23
Prithee hie thee; he'll come anon:--,23
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.,23
Nay that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?,23
[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what,23
Sing willow willow willow:,23
So get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;,23
Tis neither here nor there.,23
Dost thou in conscience think--tell me Emilia--,23
In such gross kind?,23
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?,23
No by this heavenly light!,23
I might do't as well i' the dark.,23
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.,23
In troth I think thou wouldst not.,23
done. Marry I would not do such a thing for a,23
gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty,23
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a,23
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong,23
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and,23
own world and you might quickly make it right.,23
Yes a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would,23
But I do think it is their husbands' faults,23
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,23
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,23
Why we have galls and though we have some grace,23
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell,23
As husbands have. What is it that they do,23
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?,23
It is so too: and have not we affections,23
Then let them use us well: else let them know,23
Good night good night: heaven me such uses send,23
Exeunt,23
SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.,23
Here stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:,23
Quick quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:,23
And fix most firm thy resolution.,23
Here at thy hand: be bold and take thy stand.,23
I have no great devotion to the deed;,23
Tis but a man gone. Forth my sword: he dies.,23
And he grows angry. Now whether he kill Cassio,23
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,23
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,23
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,23
That makes me ugly; and besides the Moor,23
No he must die. But so: I hear him coming.,23
I know his gait 'tis he.--Villain thou diest!,23
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,23
I will make proof of thine.,23
O I am slain!,23
I am maim'd for ever. Help ho! murder! murder!,23
Enter OTHELLO,23
O villain that I am!,23
O help ho! light! a surgeon!,23
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!,23
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet I come.,23
Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.,23
Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO,23
Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.,23
Hark!,23
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:,23
To come in to the cry without more help.,23
Hark!,23
Here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons.,23
We do not know.,23
Here here! for heaven's sake help me!,23
This is Othello's ancient as I take it.,23
What are you here that cry so grievously?,23
Give me some help.,23
I think that one of them is hereabout,23
O treacherous villains!,23
To LODOVICO and GRATIANO,23
That's one of them.,23
Stabs RODERIGO,23
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--,23
What may you be? are you of good or evil?,23
Signior Lodovico?,23
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.,23
How is't brother!,23
Marry heaven forbid!,23
Enter BIANCA,23
Who is't that cried!,23
Cassio Cassio!,23
Who they should be that have thus many led you?,23
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.,23
To bear him easily hence!,23
Gentlemen all I do suspect this trash,23
Patience awhile good Cassio. Come come;,23
Alas my friend and my dear countryman,23
What of Venice?,23
Know him! ay.,23
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,23
I am glad to see you.,23
Roderigo!,23
A chair brought in,23
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;,23
To BIANCA,23
Save you your labour. He that lies slain,23
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?,23
[To BIANCA]  What look you pale? O bear him out,23
CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off,23
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?,23
Behold her well; I pray you look upon her:,23
Though tongues were out of use.,23
Las what's the matter? what's the matter husband?,23
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:,23
Alas good gentleman! alas good Cassio!,23
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.,23
What do you shake at that?,23
O did he so? I charge you go with me.,23
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest,23
As I! foh! fie upon thee!,23
Come mistress you must tell's another tale.,23
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.,23
Aside,23
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.,23
SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;,23
Enter OTHELLO,23
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars!--,23
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,23
Yet she must die else she'll betray more men.,23
If I quench thee thou flaming minister,23
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,23
I know not where is that Promethean heat,23
I cannot give it vital growth again.,23
Kissing her,23
Justice to break her sword! One more one more.,23
And love thee after. One more and this the last:,23
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;,23
Who's there? Othello?,23
Will you come to bed my lord?,23
Ay my lord.,23
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,23
Alas my lord what do you mean by that?,23
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;,23
Talk you of killing?,23
Then heaven,23
Amen with all my heart!,23
Hum!,23
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,23
Think on thy sins.,23
Ay and for that thou diest.,23
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip?,23
These are portents; but yet I hope I hope,23
Peace and be still!,23
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee,23
No by my life and soul!,23
Sweet soul take heed,23
Ay but not yet to die.,23
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;,23
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception,23
Then Lord have mercy on me!,23
And have you mercy too! I never did,23
But with such general warranty of heaven,23
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in's hand.,23
And makest me call what I intend to do,23
I saw the handkerchief.,23
I never gave it him: send for him hither;,23
He hath confess'd.,23
That he hath used thee.,23
Ay.,23
No his mouth is stopp'd;,23
O! my fear interprets: what is he dead?,23
Had stomach for them all.,23
Out strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?,23
Down strumpet!,23
Nay if you strive--,23
Being done there is no pause.,23
It is too late.,23
[Within]  My lord  my lord! what ho! my lord my lord!,23
I that am cruel am yet merciful;,23
[Within]  What ho! my lord my lord!,23
[Within]  O good my lord I would speak a word with you!,23
Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--,23
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--,23
If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife:,23
O insupportable! O heavy hour!,23
Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe,23
[Within]  I do beseech you,23
I had forgot thee: O come in Emilia;,23
Where art thou?,23
Enter EMILIA,23
O my good lord yonder's foul murders done!,23
But now my lord.,23
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,23
Cassio my lord hath kill'd a young Venetian,23
Roderigo kill'd!,23
No Cassio is not kill'd.,23
And sweet revenge grows harsh.,23
Alas what cry is that?,23
Out and alas! that was my lady's voice.,23
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress speak!,23
O who hath done this deed?,23
Commend me to my kind lord: O farewell!,23
Why how should she be murder'd?,23
You heard her say herself it was not I.,23
She's like a liar gone to burning hell:,23
O the more angel she,23
She turn'd to folly and she was a whore.,23
She was false as water.,23
That she was false: O she was heavenly true!,23
O I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,23
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.,23
Thy husband.,23
Ay with Cassio. Nay had she been true,23
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,23
My husband!,23
An honest man he is and hates the slime,23
My husband!,23
O mistress villany hath made mocks with love,23
He woman;,23
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago.,23
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:,23
Ha!,23
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven,23
Peace you were best.,23
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!,23
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,23
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!,23
What is the matter? How now general!,23
That men must lay their murders on your neck.,23
Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man:,23
I know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain:,23
I told him what I thought and told no more,23
But did you ever tell him she was false?,23
You told a lie an odious damned lie;,23
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?,23
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:,23
O heavens forfend!,23
Nay stare not masters: it is true indeed.,23
O monstrous act!,23
I think upon't I think: I smell't: O villany!--,23
O villany villany!,23
Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak:,23
Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home.,23
He falls on the bed,23
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,23
[Rising]  O she was foul!,23
Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd:,23
Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:,23
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,23
Yea curse his better angel from his side,23
Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows,23
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:,23
With that recognizance and pledge of love,23
It was a handkerchief an antique token,23
O heaven! O heavenly powers!,23
Twill out 'twill out: I peace!,23
Let heaven and men and devils let them all,23
Be wise and get you home.,23
IAGO offers to stab EMILIA,23
Your sword upon a woman?,23
I found by fortune and did give my husband;,23
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,23
Villanous whore!,23
And I did give't my husband.,23
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen.,23
Do with so good a woman?,23
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!,23
The woman falls; sure he hath kill'd his wife.,23
He's gone but his wife's kill'd.,23
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:,23
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,23
Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO,23
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:,23
Let it go all.,23
Hark canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.,23
Singing,23
Moor she was chaste; she loved thee cruel Moor;,23
So speaking as I think I die I die.,23
I have another weapon in this chamber;,23
O here it is. Uncle I must come forth.,23
Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.,23
Or naked as I am I will assault thee.,23
What is the matter?,23
A better never did itself sustain,23
That with this little arm and this good sword,23
Than twenty times your stop: but O vain boast!,23
Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd;,23
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.,23
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,23
Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!,23
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,23
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!,23
From the possession of this heavenly sight!,23
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!,23
Oh! Oh! Oh!,23
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?,23
Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.,23
If that thou best a devil I cannot kill thee.,23
Wrench his sword from him.,23
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;,23
O thou Othello thou wert once so good,23
What shall be said to thee?,23
An honourable murderer if you will;,23
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:,23
Ay.,23
I do believe it and I ask your pardon.,23
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?,23
From this time forth I never will speak word.,23
Torments will ope your lips.,23
Sir you shall understand what hath befall'n,23
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;,23
The death of Cassio to be undertook,23
O villain!,23
Now here's another discontented paper,23
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;,23
Came in and satisfied him.,23
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief,23
I found it in my chamber:,23
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose,23
O fool! fool! fool!,23
How he upbraids Iago that he made him,23
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,23
Iago set him on.,23
Your power and your command is taken off,23
If there be any cunning cruelty,23
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,23
To the Venetian state. Come bring him away.,23
I have done the state some service and they know't.,23
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,23
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak,23
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought,23
Like the base Indian threw a pearl away,23
Albeit unused to the melting mood,23
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;,23
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk,23
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,23
Stabs himself,23
All that's spoke is marr'd.,23
Killing myself to die upon a kiss.,23
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon;,23
[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,23
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;,23
Let it be hid. Gratiano keep the house,23
For they succeed on you. To you lord governor,23
The time the place the torture: O enforce it!,23
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.,23
ACT I,24
Enter GOWER,24
To sing a song that old was sung,24
Assuming man's infirmities,24
It hath been sung at festivals,24
And lords and ladies in their lives,24
The purchase is to make men glorious;,24
If you born in these latter times,24
And that to hear an old man sing,24
I life would wish and that I might,24
This Antioch then Antiochus the Great,24
The fairest in all Syria,24
This king unto him took a fere,24
So buxom blithe and full of face,24
With whom the father liking took,24
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own,24
But custom what they did begin,24
The beauty of this sinful dame,24
To seek her as a bed-fellow,24
Which to prevent he made a law,24
That whoso ask'd her for his wife,24
So for her many a wight did die,24
What now ensues to the judgment of your eye,24
Exit,24
Enter ANTIOCHUS Prince PERICLES and followers,24
The danger of the task you undertake.,24
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,24
Bring in our daughter clothed like a bride,24
At whose conception till Lucina reign'd,24
The senate-house of planets all did sit,24
Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS,24
Graces her subjects and her thoughts the king,24
Her face the book of praises where is read,24
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath,24
You gods that made me man and sway in love,24
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,24
As I am son and servant to your will,24
Prince Pericles--,24
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,24
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:,24
Her countless glory which desert must gain;,24
Presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die.,24
Drawn by report adventurous by desire,24
That without covering save yon field of stars,24
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist,24
Antiochus I thank thee who hath taught,24
And by those fearful objects to prepare,24
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,24
I'll make my will then and as sick men do,24
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;,24
And all good men as every prince should do;,24
But my unspotted fire of love to you.,24
Thus ready for the way of life or death,24
Scorning advice read the conclusion then:,24
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.,24
Of all say'd yet I wish thee happiness!,24
Nor ask advice of any other thought,24
He reads the riddle,24
On mother's flesh which did me breed.,24
I found that kindness in a father:,24
I mother wife and yet his child.,24
As you will live resolve it you.,24
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,24
If this be true which makes me pale to read it?,24
Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS,24
But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt,24
That knowing sin within will touch the gate.,24
Who finger'd to make man his lawful music,24
But being play'd upon before your time,24
Good sooth I care not for you.,24
For that's an article within our law,24
Either expound now or receive your sentence.,24
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;,24
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,24
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.,24
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,24
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts,24
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.,24
their will;,24
It is enough you know; and it is fit,24
All love the womb that their first being bred,24
[Aside]  Heaven that I had thy head! he has found,24
But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,24
Your exposition misinterpreting,24
Yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree,24
Forty days longer we do respite you;,24
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:,24
As doth befit our honour and your worth.,24
How courtesy would seem to cover sin,24
The which is good in nothing but in sight!,24
Then were it certain you were not so bad,24
Where now you're both a father and a son,24
Which pleasure fits an husband not a father;,24
By the defiling of her parent's bed;,24
On sweetest flowers yet they poison breed.,24
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,24
One sin I know another doth provoke;,24
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,24
Then lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,24
Exit,24
He hath found the meaning for which we mean,24
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,24
In such a loathed manner;,24
For by his fall my honour must keep high.,24
Enter THALIARD,24
Thaliard,24
Her private actions to your secrecy;,24
Thaliard behold here's poison and here's gold;,24
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,24
My lord,24
Enough.,24
Let your breath cool yourself telling your haste.,24
Exit,24
Wilt live fly after: and like an arrow shot,24
His eye doth level at so thou ne'er return,24
My lord,24
I'll make him sure enough: so farewell to your highness.,24
Exit THALIARD,24
My heart can lend no succor to my head.,24
SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.,24
[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should,24
The sad companion dull-eyed melancholy,24
In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night,24
Here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them,24
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:,24
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.,24
That have their first conception by mis-dread,24
And what was first but fear what might be done,24
And so with me: the great Antiochus,24
Since he's so great can make his will his act,24
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.,24
And what may make him blush in being known,24
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,24
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;,24
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:,24
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,24
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,24
Enter HELICANUS with other Lords,24
And keep your mind till you return to us,24
Peace peace and give experience tongue.,24
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;,24
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;,24
Fits kings as they are men for they may err.,24
He flatters you makes war upon your life.,24
I cannot be much lower than my knees.,24
What shipping and what lading's in our haven,24
Exeunt Lords,24
Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?,24
If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,24
How dare the plants look up to heaven from whence,24
Thou know'st I have power,24
[Kneeling],24
Do you but strike the blow.,24
Sit down: thou art no flatterer:,24
That kings should let their ears hear their,24
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,24
What wouldst thou have me do?,24
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.,24
That minister'st a potion unto me,24
Attend me then: I went to Antioch,24
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.,24
Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.,24
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:,24
Seem'd not to strike but smooth: but thou,24
Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.,24
Under the covering of a careful night,24
Bethought me what was past what might succeed.,24
Decrease not but grow faster than the years:,24
That I should open to the listening air,24
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,24
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:,24
Must feel war's blow who spares not innocence:,24
Who now reprovest me for it--,24
Drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks,24
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;,24
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.,24
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,24
Who either by public war or private treason,24
Therefore my lord go travel for a while,24
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.,24
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.,24
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?,24
From whence we had our being and our birth.,24
Intend my travel where I'll hear from thee;,24
The care I had and have of subjects' good,24
I'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath:,24
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,24
Thou show'dst a subject's shine I a true prince.,24
SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.,24
So this is Tyre and this the court. Here must I,24
be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well I perceive,24
being bid to ask what he would of the king desired,24
had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a,24
be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.,24
You shall not need my fellow peers of Tyre,24
His seal'd commission left in trust with me,24
[Aside]  How! the king gone!,24
Why as it were unlicensed of your loves,24
Being at Antioch--,24
Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--,24
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,24
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,24
[Aside]  Well I perceive,24
But since he's gone the king's seas must please:,24
I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!,24
From him I come,24
But since my landing I have understood,24
My message must return from whence it came.,24
Commended to our master not to us:,24
As friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyre.,24
SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.,24
My Dionyza shall we rest us here,24
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?,24
For who digs hills because they do aspire,24
O my distressed lord even such our griefs are;,24
But like to groves being topp'd they higher rise.,24
Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it,24
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep,24
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;,24
They may awake their helps to comfort them.,24
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.,24
This Tarsus o'er which I have the government,24
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;,24
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;,24
Like one another's glass to trim them by:,24
And not so much to feed on as delight;,24
The name of help grew odious to repeat.,24
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,24
Were all too little to content and please,24
As houses are defiled for want of use,24
Those palates who not yet two summers younger,24
Would now be glad of bread and beg for it:,24
Thought nought too curious are ready now,24
So sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife,24
Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping;,24
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.,24
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.,24
And her prosperities so largely taste,24
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.,24
Where's the lord governor?,24
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,24
We have descried upon our neighbouring shore,24
I thought as much.,24
That may succeed as his inheritor;,24
Taking advantage of our misery,24
To beat us down the which are down already;,24
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.,24
Of their white flags display'd they bring us peace,24
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:,24
But bring they what they will and what they can,24
The ground's the lowest and we are half way there.,24
To know for what he comes and whence he comes,24
I go my lord.,24
Welcome is peace if he on peace consist;,24
Enter PERICLES with Attendants,24
Let not our ships and number of our men,24
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,24
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,24
And these our ships you happily may think,24
With bloody veins expecting overthrow,24
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.,24
And we'll pray for you.,24
We do not look for reverence but to love,24
The which when any shall not gratify,24
Be it our wives our children or ourselves,24
Till when--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen--,24
Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER,24
His child I wis to incest bring;,24
That will prove awful both in deed and word.,24
Till he hath pass'd necessity.,24
Losing a mite a mountain gain.,24
To whom I give my benison,24
Thinks all is writ he speken can;,24
Build his statue to make him glorious:,24
Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?,24
Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES  shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a  reward and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door and CLEON at another,24
Not to eat honey like a drone,24
To killen bad keep good alive;,24
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:,24
And had intent to murder him;,24
Longer for him to make his rest.,24
Where when men been there's seldom ease;,24
Thunder above and deeps below,24
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;,24
By waves from coast to coast is tost:,24
Ne aught escapen but himself;,24
Threw him ashore to give him glad:,24
Pardon old Gower--this longs the text.,24
SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.,24
Yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven!,24
Is but a substance that must yield to you;,24
Alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks,24
Nothing to think on but ensuing death:,24
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;,24
Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.,24
What ho Pilch!,24
What Patch-breech I say!,24
Look how thou stirrest now! come away or I'll,24
Faith master I am thinking of the poor men that,24
Alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what,24
well-a-day we could scarce help ourselves.,24
porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say,24
they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master I,24
Why as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the,24
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and,24
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales,24
till they've swallowed the whole parish church,24
[Aside]  A pretty moral.,24
been that day in the belfry.,24
Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I,24
jangling of the bells that he should never have,24
parish up again. But if the good King Simonides,24
[Aside]  Simonides!,24
the bee of her honey.,24
These fishers tell the infirmities of men;,24
All that may men approve or men detect!,24
Honest! good fellow what's that? If it be a day,24
look after it.,24
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our,24
A man whom both the waters and the wind,24
For them to play upon entreats you pity him:,24
No friend cannot you beg? Here's them in our,24
with working.,24
I never practised it.,24
to be got now-a-days unless thou canst fish for't.,24
But what I am want teaches me to think on:,24
And have no more of life than may suffice,24
Which if you shall refuse when I am dead,24
Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;,24
handsome fellow! Come thou shalt go home and,24
fasting-days and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,24
I thank you sir.,24
I did but crave.,24
shall 'scape whipping.,24
O not all my friend not all; for if all your,24
than to be beadle. But master I'll go draw up the,24
Exit with Third Fisherman,24
Hark you sir do you know where ye are?,24
Why I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis and,24
The good King Simonides do you call him.,24
peaceable reign and good government.,24
the name of good by his government. How far is his,24
Marry sir half a day's journey: and I'll tell,24
birth-day; and there are princes and knights come,24
Were my fortunes equal to my desires I could wish,24
O sir things must be as they may; and what a man,24
Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen drawing up a net,24
like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly,24
tis turned to a rusty armour.,24
Thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses,24
And though it was mine own part of my heritage,24
With this strict charge even as he left his life,24
Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--,24
The which the gods protect thee from!--may,24
It kept where I kept I so dearly loved it;,24
Took it in rage though calm'd have given't again:,24
Since I have here my father's gift in's will.,24
To beg of you kind friends this coat of worth,24
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,24
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,24
And if that ever my low fortune's better,24
Why wilt thou tourney for the lady?,24
Why do 'e take it and the gods give thee good on't!,24
this garment through the rough seams of the waters:,24
hope sir if you thrive you'll remember from,24
Believe 't I will.,24
And spite of all the rapture of the sea,24
Unto thy value I will mount myself,24
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.,24
Of a pair of bases.,24
make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.,24
This day I'll rise or else add ill to ill.,24
SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the,24
reception of King Princess Lords  and c.,24
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?,24
And stay your coming to present themselves.,24
In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,24
For men to see and seeing wonder at.,24
It pleaseth you my royal father to express,24
It's fit it should be so; for princes are,24
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,24
Tis now your honour daughter to explain,24
Which to preserve mine honour I'll perform.,24
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?,24
And the device he bears upon his shield,24
The word 'Lux tua vita mihi.',24
The Second Knight passes over,24
A prince of Macedon my royal father;,24
Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;,24
The Third Knight passes over,24
The third of Antioch;,24
The word 'Me pompae provexit apex.',24
What is the fourth?,24
The word 'Quod me alit me extinguit.',24
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.,24
The fifth an hand environed with clouds,24
The motto thus 'Sic spectanda fides.',24
And what's,24
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?,24
A wither'd branch that's only green at top;,24
A pretty moral;,24
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.,24
Can any way speak in his just commend;,24
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.,24
To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.,24
Until this day to scour it in the dust.,24
The outward habit by the inward man.,24
Into the gallery.,24
Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!',24
Enter SIMONIDES THAISA Lords Attendants and Knights from tilting,24
To say you're welcome were superfluous.,24
As in a title-page your worth in arms,24
Since every worth in show commends itself.,24
You are princes and my guests.,24
To whom this wreath of victory I give,24
Tis more by fortune lady than by merit.,24
And here I hope is none that envies it.,24
To make some good but others to exceed;,24
the feast--,24
Marshal the rest as they deserve their grace.,24
Your presence glads our days: honour we love;,24
Sir yonder is your place.,24
Contend not sir; for we are gentlemen,24
Envy the great nor do the low despise.,24
Sit sir sit.,24
These cates resist me she but thought upon.,24
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.,24
He's but a country gentleman;,24
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.,24
Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,24
Had princes sit like stars about his throne,24
None that beheld him but like lesser lights,24
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,24
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,24
And gives them what he will not what they crave.,24
Who can be other in this royal presence?,24
As you do love fill to your mistress' lips--,24
We thank your grace.,24
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,24
Had not a show might countervail his worth.,24
What is it,24
O attend my daughter:,24
Who freely give to every one that comes,24
And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,24
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,24
Alas my father it befits not me,24
He may my proffer take for an offence,24
How!,24
[Aside]  Now by the gods he could not please me better.,24
Of whence he is his name and parentage.,24
I thank him.,24
I thank both him and you and pledge him freely.,24
Of whence you are your name and parentage.,24
My education been in arts and arms;,24
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,24
He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,24
Who only by misfortune of the seas,24
Now by the gods I pity his misfortune,24
Come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles,24
Even in your armours as you are address'd,24
I will not have excuse with saying this,24
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.,24
So this was well ask'd'twas so well perform'd.,24
Here is a lady that wants breathing too:,24
Are excellent in making ladies trip;,24
In those that practise them they are my lord.,24
Of your fair courtesy.,24
Unclasp unclasp:,24
To PERICLES,24
These knights unto their several lodgings!,24
Yours sir,24
I am at your grace's pleasure.,24
And that's the mark I know you level at:,24
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.,24
SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.,24
No Escanes know this of me,24
For which the most high gods not minding longer,24
Due to this heinous capital offence,24
When he was seated in a chariot,24
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up,24
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall,24
Twas very strange.,24
This king were great his greatness was no guard,24
Tis very true.,24
See not a man in private conference,24
It shall no longer grieve without reproof.,24
Follow me then. Lord Helicane a word.,24
Know that our griefs are risen to the top,24
Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.,24
But if the prince do live let us salute him,24
If in the world he live we'll seek him out;,24
And be resolved he lives to govern us,24
And leave us to our free election.,24
And knowing this kingdom is without a head--,24
Soon fall to ruin--your noble self,24
We thus submit unto--our sovereign.,24
For honour's cause forbear your suffrages:,24
Take I your wish I leap into the seas,24
A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to,24
If in which time expired he not return,24
But if I cannot win you to this love,24
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;,24
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.,24
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,24
Then you love us we you and we'll clasp hands:,24
Exeunt,24
Enter SIMONIDES reading a letter at one door: the Knights meet him,24
Knights from my daughter this I let you know,24
A married life.,24
Which yet from her by no means can I get.,24
Faith by no means; she has so strictly tied,24
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;,24
And on her virgin honour will not break it.,24
Exeunt Knights,24
They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:,24
Or never more to view nor day nor light.,24
I like that well: nay how absolute she's in't,24
Well I do commend her choice;,24
Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.,24
All fortune to the good Simonides!,24
For your sweet music this last night: I do,24
With such delightful pleasing harmony.,24
Not my desert.,24
The worst of all her scholars my good lord.,24
What do you think of my daughter sir?,24
And she is fair too is she not?,24
Sir my daughter thinks very well of you;,24
And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.,24
She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.,24
A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre!,24
O seek not to entrap me gracious lord,24
That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,24
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter and thou art,24
By the gods I have not:,24
Nor never did my actions yet commence,24
Traitor thou liest.,24
Ay traitor.,24
That calls me traitor I return the lie.,24
My actions are as noble as my thoughts,24
I came unto your court for honour's cause,24
And he that otherwise accounts of me,24
No?,24
Enter THAISA,24
Resolve your angry father if my tongue,24
To any syllable that made love to you.,24
Who takes offence at that would make me glad?,24
Aside,24
I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.,24
Bestow your love and your affections,24
Aside,24
May be nor can I think the contrary,24
Therefore hear you mistress; either frame,24
Either be ruled by me or I will make you--,24
Nay come your hands and lips must seal it too:,24
And for a further grief--God give you joy!--,24
Yes if you love me sir.,24
What are you both agreed?,24
It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed;,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER,24
No din but snores the house about,24
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.,24
Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;,24
E'er the blither for their drouth.,24
Where by the loss of maidenhead,24
And time that is so briefly spent,24
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.,24
Enter PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door with  Attendants; a Messenger meets them kneels and  gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it  SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter  THAISA with child with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The  KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and  PERICLES takes leave of her father and depart with  LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest,24
Of Pericles the careful search,24
Which the world together joins,24
That horse and sail and high expense,24
Fame answering the most strange inquire,24
Are letters brought the tenor these:,24
The men of Tyrus on the head,24
The crown of Tyre but he will none:,24
Says to 'em if King Pericles,24
He obedient to their dooms,24
Brought hither to Pentapolis,24
And every one with claps can sound,24
Who dream'd who thought of such a thing?',24
His queen with child makes her desire--,24
Omit we all their dole and woe:,24
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes,24
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood,24
Disgorges such a tempest forth,24
So up and down the poor ship drives:,24
Does fall in travail with her fear:,24
Shall for itself itself perform.,24
Conveniently the rest convey;,24
In your imagination hold,24
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.,24
SCENE I:,24
Thou god of this great vast rebuke these surges,24
Upon the winds command bind them in brass,24
Thy deafening dreadful thunders; gently quench,24
How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;,24
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,24
Divinest patroness and midwife gentle,24
Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs,24
Enter LYCHORIDA with an Infant,24
Here is a thing too young for such a place,24
Am like to do: take in your arms this piece,24
How how Lychorida!,24
Here's all that is left living of your queen,24
Be manly and take comfort.,24
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,24
Recall not what we give and therein may,24
Patience good sir,24
Now mild may be thy life!,24
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for,24
That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!,24
As fire air water earth and heaven can make,24
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,24
Throw their best eyes upon't!,24
What courage sir? God save you!,24
It hath done to me the worst. Yet for the love,24
I would it would be quiet.,24
Blow and split thyself.,24
the moon I care not.,24
the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be,24
That's your superstition.,24
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore,24
As you think meet. Most wretched queen!,24
A terrible childbed hast thou had my dear;,24
Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time,24
Must cast thee scarcely coffin'd in the ooze;,24
And e'er-remaining lamps the belching whale,24
Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,24
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander,24
Upon the pillow: hie thee whiles I say,24
Exit LYCHORIDA,24
and bitumed ready.,24
We are near Tarsus.,24
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?,24
O make for Tarsus!,24
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it,24
I'll bring the body presently.,24
SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.,24
Philemon ho!,24
Doth my lord call?,24
T has been a turbulent and stormy night.,24
Till now I ne'er endured.,24
There's nothing can be minister'd to nature,24
To PHILEMON,24
And tell me how it works.,24
Enter two Gentlemen,24
Good morrow to your lordship.,24
Why do you stir so early?,24
Our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea,24
The very principals did seem to rend,24
Made me to quit the house.,24
Tis not our husbandry.,24
But I much marvel that your lordship having,24
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.,24
Nature should be so conversant with pain,24
I hold it ever,24
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs,24
But immortality attends the former.,24
Have studied physic through which secret art,24
Together with my practise made familiar,24
That dwell in vegetives in metals stones;,24
That nature works and of her cures; which doth give me,24
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,24
To please the fool and death.,24
Your charity and hundreds call themselves,24
And not your knowledge your personal pain but even,24
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.,24
So; lift there.,24
Sir even now,24
Tis of some wreck.,24
Tis like a coffin sir.,24
Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:,24
Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.,24
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!,24
I never saw so huge a billow sir,24
Wrench it open;,24
A delicate odour.,24
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!,24
Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured,24
Apollo perfect me in the characters!,24
Here I give to understand,24
I King Pericles have lost,24
Who finds her give her burying;,24
Besides this treasure for a fee,24
If thou livest Pericles thou hast a heart,24
Most likely sir.,24
For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough,24
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.,24
Death may usurp on nature many hours,24
The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian,24
Who was by good appliance recovered.,24
Well said well said; the fire and cloths.,24
Cause it to sound beseech you.,24
The music there!--I pray you give her air.,24
This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth,24
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow,24
The heavens,24
Your fame forever.,24
Her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels,24
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;,24
Do appear to make the world twice rich. Live,24
Rare as you seem to be.,24
O dear Diana,24
Is not this strange?,24
Hush my gentle neighbours!,24
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,24
And AEsculapius guide us!,24
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.,24
Most honour'd Cleon I must needs be gone;,24
In a litigious peace. You and your lady,24
Make up the rest upon you!,24
Yet glance full wanderingly on us.,24
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,24
We cannot but obey,24
As doth the sea she lies in yet the end,24
For she was born at sea I have named so here,24
The infant of your care; beseeching you,24
Manner'd as she is born.,24
Your grace that fed my country with your corn,24
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection,24
By you relieved would force me to my duty:,24
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,24
I believe you;,24
Without your vows. Till she be married madam,24
Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,24
Good madam make me blessed in your care,24
I have one myself,24
Than yours my lord.,24
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,24
The gentlest winds of heaven.,24
Your offer. Come dearest madam. O no tears,24
Look to your little mistress on whose grace,24
Exeunt,24
Enter CERIMON and THAISA,24
Lay with you in your coffer: which are now,24
It is my lord's.,24
Even on my eaning time; but whether there,24
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,24
A vestal livery will I take me to,24
Madam if this you purpose as ye speak,24
Where you may abide till your date expire.,24
Shall there attend you.,24
Yet my good will is great though the gift small.,24
ACT IV,24
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,24
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,24
Now to Marina bend your mind,24
At Tarsus and by Cleon train'd,24
Of education all the grace,24
Of general wonder. But alack,24
Of earned praise Marina's life,24
And in this kind hath our Cleon,24
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid,24
For certain in our story she,24
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk,24
Or when she would with sharp needle wound,24
By hurting it; or when to the lute,24
That still records with moan; or when,24
Vail to her mistress Dian; still,24
With absolute Marina: so,24
Vie feathers white. Marina gets,24
And not as given. This so darks,24
That Cleon's wife with envy rare,24
For good Marina that her daughter,24
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,24
And cursed Dionyza hath,24
Prest for this blow. The unborn event,24
Only I carry winged time,24
Which never could I so convey,24
Dionyza does appear,24
Exit,24
Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE,24
Tis but a blow which never shall be known.,24
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,24
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity which,24
A soldier to thy purpose.,24
The fitter then the gods should have her. Here,24
Thou art resolved?,24
Enter MARINA with a basket of flowers,24
To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows blues,24
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,24
Born in a tempest when my mother died,24
Whirring me from my friends.,24
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not,24
A nurse of me. Lord how your favour's changed,24
Come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it.,24
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,24
No I pray you;,24
Come come;,24
With more than foreign heart. We every day,24
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,24
Blame both my lord and me that we have taken,24
Walk and be cheerful once again; reserve,24
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me,24
Well I will go;,24
Come come I know 'tis good for you.,24
Remember what I have said.,24
I'll leave you my sweet lady for a while:,24
What! I must have a care of you.,24
Exit DIONYZA,24
South-west.,24
Was't so?,24
But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors galling,24
And clasping to the mast endured a sea,24
When was this?,24
Never was waves nor wind more violent;,24
A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one 'wilt out?',24
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles and,24
Come say your prayers.,24
If you require a little space for prayer,24
For the gods are quick of ear and I am sworn,24
Why will you kill me?,24
Why would she have me kill'd?,24
I never did her hurt in all my life:,24
To any living creature: believe me la,24
I trod upon a worm against my will,24
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,24
My commission,24
You will not do't for all the world I hope.,24
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,24
Good sooth it show'd well in you: do so now:,24
And save poor me the weaker.,24
And will dispatch.,24
Enter Pirates,24
LEONINE runs away,24
Half-part mates half-part.,24
Exeunt Pirates with MARINA,24
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;,24
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear,24
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:,24
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,24
Exit,24
Enter Pandar Bawd and BOULT,24
Sir?,24
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being,24
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but,24
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.,24
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in,24
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor,24
Ay to eleven; and brought them down again. But,24
What else man? The stuff we have a strong wind,24
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome o',24
lay with the little baggage.,24
for worms. But I'll go search the market.,24
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a,24
Why to give over I pray you? is it a shame to get,24
O our credit comes not in like the commodity nor,24
if in our youths we could pick up some pretty,24
Besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods,24
Come other sorts offend as well as we.,24
Neither is our profession any trade; it's no,24
Re-enter BOULT with the Pirates and MARINA,24
she's a virgin?,24
Master I have gone through for this piece you see:,24
Boult has she any qualities?,24
good clothes: there's no further necessity of,24
What's her price Boult?,24
Well follow me my masters you shall have your,24
what she has to do that she may not be raw in her,24
Exeunt Pandar and Pirates,24
hair complexion height age with warrant of her,24
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap,24
as I command you.,24
Exit,24
He should have struck not spoke; or that these pirates,24
For to seek my mother!,24
That I am pretty.,24
I accuse them not.,24
The more my fault,24
Ay and you shall live in pleasure.,24
Yes indeed shall you and taste gentlemen of all,24
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?,24
What would you have me be an I be not a woman?,24
Marry whip thee gosling: I think I shall have,24
foolish sapling and must be bowed as I would have,24
The gods defend me!,24
must comfort you men must feed you men must stir,24
Re-enter BOULT,24
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;,24
And I prithee tell me how dost thou find the,24
Faith they listened to me as they would have,24
Spaniard's mouth so watered that he went to bed to,24
We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.,24
French knight that cowers i' the hams?,24
Ay he: he offered to cut a caper at the,24
he would see her to-morrow.,24
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will,24
sun.,24
should lodge them with this sign.,24
have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must,24
willingly despise profit where you have most gain.,24
lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good,24
I understand you not.,24
blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.,24
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go,24
Faith some do and some do not. But mistress if,24
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.,24
Who should deny it? Come young one I like the,24
Ay by my faith they shall not be changed yet.,24
sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.,24
turn; therefore say what a paragon she is and thou,24
I warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake,24
the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.,24
If fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep,24
Diana aid my purpose!,24
Exeunt,24
Enter CLEON and DIONYZA,24
O Dionyza such a piece of slaughter,24
I think,24
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,24
Much less in blood than virtue yet a princess,24
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!,24
If thou hadst drunk to him 't had been a kindness,24
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?,24
To foster it nor ever to preserve.,24
Unless you play the pious innocent,24
She died by foul play.',24
Of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods,24
Be one of those that think,24
And open this to Pericles. I do shame,24
And of how coward a spirit.,24
Who ever but his approbation added,24
From honourable sources.,24
Yet none does know but you how she came dead,24
She did disdain my child and stood between,24
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;,24
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;,24
You not your child well loving yet I find,24
Perform'd to your sole daughter.,24
And as for Pericles,24
And yet we mourn: her monument,24
In glittering golden characters express,24
At whose expense 'tis done.,24
Which to betray dost with thine angel's face,24
You are like one that superstitiously,24
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.,24
SCENE IV:,24
Thus time we waste and longest leagues make short;,24
Making to take your imagination,24
By you being pardon'd we commit no crime,24
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you,24
The stages of our story. Pericles,24
Attended on by many a lord and knight.,24
Old Escanes whom Helicanus late,24
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,24
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought,24
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on--,24
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;,24
DUMB SHOW.,24
See how belief may suffer by foul show!,24
And Pericles in sorrow all devour'd,24
o'ershower'd,24
Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs:,24
A tempest which his mortal vessel tears,24
The epitaph is for Marina writ,24
Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument,24
Who wither'd in her spring of year.,24
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;,24
Thetis being proud swallow'd some part o' the earth:,24
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:,24
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.',24
So well as soft and tender flattery.,24
And bear his courses to be ordered,24
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day,24
And think you now are all in Mytilene.,24
SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.,24
Did you ever hear the like?,24
being once gone.,24
dream of such a thing?,24
shall's go hear the vestals sing?,24
am out of the road of rutting for ever.,24
SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.,24
Well I had rather than twice the worth of her she,24
Fie fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god,24
either get her ravished or be rid of her. When she,24
kindness of our profession she has me her quirks,24
knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,24
Faith I must ravish her or she'll disfurnish us,24
Now the pox upon her green-sickness for me!,24
way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.,24
baggage would but give way to customers.,24
How now! How a dozen of virginities?,24
I am glad to see your honour in good health.,24
resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!,24
withal and defy the surgeon?,24
came her like in Mytilene.,24
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.,24
For flesh and blood sir white and red you shall,24
What prithee?,24
That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it,24
Exit BOULT,24
plucked yet I can assure you.,24
Is she not a fair creature?,24
Well there's for you: leave us.,24
I'll have done presently.,24
[To MARINA]  First I would have you note this is,24
I desire to find him so that I may worthily note him.,24
whom I am bound to.,24
indeed; but how honourable he is in that I know not.,24
you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.,24
Ha' you done?,24
pains to work her to your manage. Come we will,24
Exeunt Bawd Pandar and BOULT,24
What trade sir?,24
I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.,24
E'er since I can remember.,24
five or at seven?,24
Why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a,24
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,24
honourable parts and are the governor of this place.,24
Who is my principal?,24
of shame and iniquity. O you have heard something,24
wooing. But I protest to thee pretty one my,24
upon thee. Come bring me to some private place:,24
If you were born to honour show it now;,24
That thought you worthy of it.,24
For me,24
Have placed me in this sty where since I came,24
O that the gods,24
Though they did change me to the meanest bird,24
I did not think,24
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,24
Persever in that clear way thou goest,24
The good gods preserve you!,24
That I came with no ill intent; for to me,24
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue and,24
Hold here's more gold for thee.,24
That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost,24
Re-enter BOULT,24
Avaunt thou damned door-keeper!,24
Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!,24
How's this? We must take another course with you.,24
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,24
a spaniel. Come your ways.,24
I must have your maidenhead taken off or the common,24
have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways I say.,24
How now! what's the matter?,24
words to the Lord Lysimachus.,24
She makes our profession as it were to stink afore,24
Marry hang her up for ever!,24
nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a,24
Boult take her away; use her at thy pleasure:,24
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she,24
Hark hark you gods!,24
come within my doors! Marry hang you! She's born,24
Marry come up my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!,24
Come mistress; come your ways with me.,24
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.,24
Come now your one thing.,24
Why I could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress.,24
Since they do better thee in their command.,24
Of hell would not in reputation change:,24
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;,24
Thy ear is liable; thy food is such,24
What would you have me do? go to the wars would,24
of a leg and have not money enough in the end to,24
Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty,24
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:,24
For what thou professest a baboon could he speak,24
Would safely deliver me from this place!,24
If that thy master would gain by thee,24
With other virtues which I'll keep from boast:,24
I doubt not but this populous city will,24
But can you teach all this you speak of?,24
And prostitute me to the basest groom,24
Well I will see what I can do for thee: if I can,24
But amongst honest women.,24
But since my master and mistress have bought you,24
will make them acquainted with your purpose and I,24
Come I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.,24
ACT V,24
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes and chances,24
She sings like one immortal and she dances,24
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes,24
That even her art sisters the natural roses;,24
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,24
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;,24
Where we left him on the sea. We there him lost;,24
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast,24
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence,24
His banners sable trimm'd with rich expense;,24
In your supposing once more put your sight,24
Where what is done in action more if might,24
Exit,24
pavilion on deck with a curtain before it; PERICLES,24
beside the Tyrian vessel.,24
[To the Sailor of Mytilene]  Where is lord Helicanus?,24
O here he is.,24
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,24
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.,24
Enter two or three Gentlemen,24
Gentlemen there's some of worth would come aboard;,24
The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend and go on board the barge,24
Sir,24
Resolve you.,24
And you sir to outlive the age I am,24
You wish me well.,24
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,24
First what is your place?,24
Sir,24
A man who for this three months hath not spoken,24
But to prorogue his grief.,24
Twould be too tedious to repeat;,24
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.,24
You may;,24
Yet let me obtain my wish.,24
PERICLES discovered,24
Till the disaster that one mortal night,24
Sir king all hail! the gods preserve you!,24
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.,24
We have a maid in Mytilene I durst wager,24
Tis well bethought.,24
And other chosen attractions would allure,24
Which now are midway stopp'd:,24
And with her fellow maids is now upon,24
The island's side.,24
Sure all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit,24
We have stretch'd thus far let us beseech you,24
Wherein we are not destitute for want,24
O sir a courtesy,24
For every graff would send a caterpillar,24
Let me entreat to know at large the cause,24
Sit sir I will recount it to you:,24
Re-enter from the barge Lord with MARINA and a young Lady,24
The lady that I sent for. Welcome fair one!,24
She's a gallant lady.,24
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,24
Fair one all goodness that consists in bounty,24
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat,24
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay,24
Sir I will use,24
That none but I and my companion maid,24
Come let us leave her;,24
MARINA sings,24
No nor look'd on us.,24
Hail sir! my lord lend ear.,24
I am a maid,24
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,24
Might equal yours if both were justly weigh'd.,24
My derivation was from ancestors,24
But time hath rooted out my parentage,24
Bound me in servitude.,24
I will desist;,24
And whispers in mine ear 'Go not till he speak.',24
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?,24
You would not do me violence.,24
You are like something that--What country-woman?,24
No nor of any shores:,24
No other than I appear.,24
My dearest wife was like this maid and such a one,24
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;,24
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;,24
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?,24
You may discern the place.,24
And how achieved you these endowments which,24
If I should tell my history it would seem,24
Prithee speak:,24
Modest as Justice and thou seem'st a palace,24
believe thee,24
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st,24
Didst thou not say when I did push thee back--,24
From good descending?,24
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st,24
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,24
Some such thing,24
Did warrant me was likely.,24
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part,24
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look,24
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?,24
Recount I do beseech thee: come sit by me.,24
O I am mock'd,24
To make the world to laugh at me.,24
Or here I'll cease.,24
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,24
The name,24
My father and a king.,24
And call'd Marina?,24
But not to be a troubler of your peace,24
But are you flesh and blood?,24
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?,24
Call'd Marina,24
At sea! what mother?,24
Who died the minute I was born,24
Deliver'd weeping.,24
Aside,24
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:,24
I'll hear you more to the bottom of your story,24
You scorn: believe me 'twere best I did give o'er.,24
Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave:,24
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;,24
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd,24
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;,24
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?,24
You think me an impostor: no good faith;,24
If good King Pericles be.,24
Calls my lord?,24
Most wise in general: tell me if thou canst,24
That thus hath made me weep?,24
Here is the regent sir of Mytilene,24
She would never tell,24
She would sit still and weep.,24
Give me a gash put me to present pain;,24
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,24
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;,24
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,24
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.,24
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,24
First sir I pray,24
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now,24
Thou hast been godlike perfect,24
To Pericles thy father.,24
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?,24
The minute I began.,24
Give me fresh garments. Mine own Helicanus;,24
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;,24
She is thy very princess. Who is this?,24
Who hearing of your melancholy state,24
I embrace you.,24
O heavens bless my girl! But hark what music?,24
O'er point by point for yet he seems to doubt,24
My lord I hear none.,24
The music of the spheres! List my Marina.,24
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?,24
Music,24
It nips me unto listening and thick slumber,24
Sleeps,24
So leave him all. Well my companion friends,24
I'll well remember you.,24
DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision,24
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.,24
Before the people all,24
To mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call,24
Or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe;,24
Awake and tell thy dream.,24
Celestial Dian goddess argentine,24
Re-enter HELICANUS LYSIMACHUS and MARINA,24
My purpose was for Tarsus there to strike,24
For other service first: toward Ephesus,24
To LYSIMACHUS,24
And give you gold for such provision,24
Sir,24
I have another suit.,24
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems,24
Sir lend me your arm.,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus,24
More a little and then dumb.,24
For such kindness must relieve me,24
What pageantry what feats what shows,24
The regent made in Mytilene,24
That he is promised to be wived,24
Till he had done his sacrifice,24
The interim pray you all confound.,24
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.,24
Our king and all his company.,24
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.,24
SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing,24
Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants,24
Enter PERICLES with his train; LYSIMACHUS HELICANUS MARINA and a Lady,24
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;,24
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.,24
A maid-child call'd Marina; who O goddess,24
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years,24
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore,24
Where by her own most clear remembrance she,24
Voice and favour!,24
Faints,24
Noble sir,24
This is your wife.,24
I threw her overboard with these very arms.,24
Tis most certain.,24
Early in blustering morn this lady was,24
Found there rich jewels; recover'd her and placed her,24
May we see them?,24
Whither I invite you. Look Thaisa is recovered.,24
If he be none of mine my sanctity,24
But curb it spite of seeing. O my lord,24
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,24
The voice of dead Thaisa!,24
And drown'd.,24
Now I know you better.,24
The king my father gave you such a ring.,24
This this: no more you gods! your present kindness,24
That on the touching of her lips I may,24
A second time within these arms.,24
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.,24
Look who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh Thaisa;,24
For she was yielded there.,24
Hail madam and my queen!,24
You have heard me say when I did fly from Tyre,24
Can you remember what I call'd the man?,24
Twas Helicanus then.,24
Embrace him dear Thaisa; this is he.,24
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,24
Lord Cerimon my lord; this man,24
From first to last resolve you.,24
The gods can have no mortal officer,24
How this dead queen re-lives?,24
Beseech you first go with me to my house,24
How she came placed here in the temple;,24
Pure Dian bless thee for thy vision! I,24
This prince the fair-betrothed of your daughter,24
This ornament,24
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,24
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit sir,24
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there my queen,24
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:,24
Lord Cerimon we do our longing stay,24
Exeunt,24
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard,24
In Pericles his queen and daughter seen,24
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,24
In Helicanus may you well descry,24
In reverend Cerimon there well appears,24
For wicked Cleon and his wife when fame,24
Of Pericles to rage the city turn,24
The gods for murder seemed so content,24
So on your patience evermore attending,24
Exit,24
SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.,25
Old John of Gaunt time-honour'd Lancaster,25
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,25
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,25
I have my liege.,25
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;,25
On some known ground of treachery in him?,25
On some apparent danger seen in him,25
Then call them to our presence; face to face,25
The accuser and the accused freely speak:,25
In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire.,25
Many years of happy days befal,25
Each day still better other's happiness;,25
Add an immortal title to your crown!,25
As well appeareth by the cause you come;,25
Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object,25
First heaven be the record to my speech!,25
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,25
Come I appellant to this princely presence.,25
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak,25
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.,25
Too good to be so and too bad to live,25
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.,25
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;,25
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.,25
Tis not the trial of a woman's war,25
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;,25
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast,25
First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me,25
Which else would post until it had return'd,25
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,25
I do defy him and I spit at him;,25
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,25
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,25
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.,25
By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie.,25
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,25
Which fear not reverence makes thee to except.,25
As to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop:,25
Will I make good against thee arm to arm,25
I take it up; and by that sword I swear,25
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,25
And when I mount alive may I not light,25
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?,25
So much as of a thought of ill in him.,25
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles,25
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,25
Besides I say and will in battle prove,25
That ever was survey'd by English eye,25
Complotted and contrived in this land,25
Further I say and further will maintain,25
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,25
And consequently like a traitor coward,25
Which blood like sacrificing Abel's cries,25
To me for justice and rough chastisement;,25
This arm shall do it or this life be spent.,25
Thomas of Norfolk what say'st thou to this?,25
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,25
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.,25
Were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir,25
Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,25
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize,25
He is our subject Mowbray; so art thou:,25
Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart,25
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais,25
The other part reserved I by consent,25
Upon remainder of a dear account,25
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,25
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.,25
The honourable father to my foe,25
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul,25
I did confess it and exactly begg'd,25
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,25
A recreant and most degenerate traitor,25
And interchangeably hurl down my gage,25
To prove myself a loyal gentleman,25
In haste whereof most heartily I pray,25
Wrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me;,25
This we prescribe though no physician;,25
Forget forgive; conclude and be agreed;,25
Good uncle let this end where it begun;,25
To be a make-peace shall become my age:,25
And Norfolk throw down his.,25
Obedience bids I should not bid again.,25
Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot.,25
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,25
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.,25
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,25
Which breathed this poison.,25
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.,25
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,25
Is spotless reputation: that away,25
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest,25
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:,25
Then dear my liege mine honour let me try;,25
Cousin throw up your gage; do you begin.,25
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?,25
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue,25
Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear,25
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,25
Exit JOHN OF GAUNT,25
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,25
At Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day:,25
The swelling difference of your settled hate:,25
Justice design the victor's chivalry.,25
Be ready to direct these home alarms.,25
SCENE II. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.,25
Alas the part I had in Woodstock's blood,25
To stir against the butchers of his life!,25
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,25
Who when they see the hours ripe on earth,25
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?,25
Edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one,25
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:,25
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;,25
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,25
Is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt,25
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.,25
That metal that self-mould that fashion'd thee,25
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent,25
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,25
Call it not patience Gaunt; it is despair:,25
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,25
That which in mean men we intitle patience,25
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,25
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,25
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,25
An angry arm against His minister.,25
To God the widow's champion and defence.,25
Thou goest to Coventry there to behold,25
O sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,25
Or if misfortune miss the first career,25
They may break his foaming courser's back,25
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!,25
With her companion grief must end her life.,25
As much good stay with thee as go with me!,25
Not with the empty hollowness but weight:,25
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.,25
Lo this is all:--nay yet depart not so;,25
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah what?--,25
Alack and what shall good old York there see,25
Unpeopled offices untrodden stones?,25
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,25
Desolate desolate will I hence and die:,25
Exeunt,25
Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
Yea at all points; and longs to enter in.,25
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.,25
For nothing but his majesty's approach.,25
Marshal demand of yonder champion,25
Ask him his name and orderly proceed,25
In God's name and the king's say who thou art,25
Against what man thou comest and what thy quarrel:,25
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!,25
Who hither come engaged by my oath--,25
Both to defend my loyalty and truth,25
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me,25
To prove him in defending of myself,25
And as I truly fight defend me heaven!,25
Marshal ask yonder knight in arms,25
Thus plated in habiliments of war,25
Depose him in the justice of his cause.,25
Before King Richard in his royal lists?,25
Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven!,25
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,25
In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk,25
To God of heaven King Richard and to me;,25
On pain of death no person be so bold,25
Except the marshal and such officers,25
Lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand,25
For Mowbray and myself are like two men,25
Then let us take a ceremonious leave,25
The appellant in all duty greets your highness,25
We will descend and fold him in our arms.,25
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!,25
Lament we may but not revenge thee dead.,25
For me if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:,25
Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight.,25
Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle;,25
But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath.,25
The daintiest last to make the end most sweet:,25
Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate,25
To reach at victory above my head,25
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,25
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,25
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!,25
And let thy blows doubly redoubled,25
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:,25
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!,25
There lives or dies true to King Richard's throne,25
Never did captive with a freer heart,25
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,25
This feast of battle with mine adversary.,25
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:,25
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.,25
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.,25
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby,25
Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen.,25
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby,25
On pain to be found false and recreant,25
A traitor to his God his king and him;,25
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk,25
Both to defend himself and to approve,25
To God his sovereign and to him disloyal;,25
Attending but the signal to begin.,25
A charge sounded,25
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,25
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound,25
A long flourish,25
And list what with our council we have done.,25
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;,25
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;,25
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,25
To wake our peace which in our country's cradle,25
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,25
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,25
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,25
You cousin Hereford upon pain of life,25
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,25
Your will be done: this must my comfort be,25
And those his golden beams to you here lent,25
Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom,25
The sly slow hours shall not determinate,25
The hopeless word of 'never to return',25
A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege,25
A dearer merit not so deep a maim,25
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.,25
My native English now I must forego:,25
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,25
Or being open put into his hands,25
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,25
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance,25
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,25
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,25
It boots thee not to be compassionate:,25
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,25
Return again and take an oath with thee.,25
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--,25
To keep the oath that we administer:,25
Embrace each other's love in banishment;,25
Nor never write regreet nor reconcile,25
Nor never by advised purpose meet,25
Gainst us our state our subjects or our land.,25
And I to keep all this.,25
By this time had the king permitted us,25
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,25
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;,25
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.,25
My name be blotted from the book of life,25
But what thou art God thou and I do know;,25
Farewell my liege. Now no way can I stray;,25
Exit,25
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect,25
Pluck'd four away.,25
Six frozen winter spent,25
How long a time lies in one little word!,25
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.,25
He shortens four years of my son's exile:,25
For ere the six years that he hath to spend,25
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light,25
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,25
Why uncle thou hast many years to live.,25
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,25
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,25
Thy word is current with him for my death,25
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,25
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?,25
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather,25
O had it been a stranger not my child,25
A partial slander sought I to avoid,25
Alas I look'd when some of you should say,25
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue,25
Cousin farewell; and uncle bid him so:,25
Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train,25
From where you do remain let paper show.,25
As far as land will let me by your side.,25
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?,25
When the tongue's office should be prodigal,25
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.,25
What is six winters? they are quickly gone.,25
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.,25
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.,25
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set,25
Nay rather every tedious stride I make,25
I wander from the jewels that I love.,25
To foreign passages and in the end,25
But that I was a journeyman to grief?,25
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.,25
There is no virtue like necessity.,25
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,25
Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour,25
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air,25
Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it,25
Suppose the singing birds musicians,25
The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more,25
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite,25
O who can hold a fire in his hand,25
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite,25
Or wallow naked in December snow,25
O no! the apprehension of the good,25
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more,25
Come come my son I'll bring thee on thy way:,25
Then England's ground farewell; sweet soil adieu;,25
Where'er I wander boast of this I can,25
Exeunt,25
Enter KING RICHARD II with BAGOT and GREEN at one door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another,25
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?,25
But to the next highway and there I left him.,25
Faith none for me; except the north-east wind,25
Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance,25
What said our cousin when you parted with him?,25
And for my heart disdained that my tongue,25
To counterfeit oppression of such grief,25
Marry would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours,25
He should have had a volume of farewells;,25
He is our cousin cousin; but 'tis doubt,25
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.,25
Observed his courtship to the common people;,25
With humble and familiar courtesy,25
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles,25
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.,25
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,25
With 'Thanks my countrymen my loving friends;',25
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.,25
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,25
Ere further leisure yield them further means,25
We will ourself in person to this war:,25
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light,25
The revenue whereof shall furnish us,25
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;,25
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,25
For we will make for Ireland presently.,25
Bushy what news?,25
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste,25
Where lies he?,25
Now put it God in the physician's mind,25
The lining of his coffers shall make coats,25
Come gentlemen let's all go visit him:,25
Amen.,25
ACT II,25
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick with the DUKE OF YORK and c,25
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?,25
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.,25
Enforce attention like deep harmony:,25
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.,25
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;,25
The setting sun and music at the close,25
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:,25
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.,25
As praises of whose taste the wise are fond,25
The open ear of youth doth always listen;,25
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation,25
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--,25
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?,25
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.,25
Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose.,25
And thus expiring do foretell of him:,25
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;,25
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;,25
Light vanity insatiate cormorant,25
This royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle,25
This other Eden demi-paradise,25
Against infection and the hand of war,25
This precious stone set in the silver sea,25
Or as a moat defensive to a house,25
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England,25
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,25
For Christian service and true chivalry,25
Of the world's ransom blessed Mary's Son,25
Dear for her reputation through the world,25
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:,25
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege,25
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:,25
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.,25
How happy then were my ensuing death!,25
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;,25
How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?,25
O how that name befits my composition!,25
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;,25
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;,25
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,25
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt:,25
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.,25
No misery makes sport to mock itself:,25
I mock my name great king to flatter thee.,25
No no men living flatter those that die.,25
O no! thou diest though I the sicker be.,25
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;,25
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,25
And thou too careless patient as thou art,25
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:,25
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;,25
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.,25
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,25
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,25
Why cousin wert thou regent of the world,25
But for thy world enjoying but this land,25
Landlord of England art thou now not king:,25
A lunatic lean-witted fool,25
Darest with thy frozen admonition,25
With fury from his native residence.,25
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,25
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.,25
For that I was his father Edward's son;,25
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:,25
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!,25
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:,25
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,25
Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee!,25
Convey me to my bed then to my grave:,25
Exit borne off by his Attendants,25
For both hast thou and both become the grave.,25
To wayward sickliness and age in him:,25
As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here.,25
As theirs so mine; and all be as it is.,25
My liege old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.,25
Nay nothing; all is said,25
Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent.,25
Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe.,25
His time is spent our pilgrimage must be.,25
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,25
But only they have privilege to live.,25
Towards our assistance we do seize to us,25
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.,25
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?,25
Not Gaunt's rebukes nor England's private wrongs,25
About his marriage nor my own disgrace,25
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.,25
Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first:,25
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,25
His face thou hast for even so look'd he,25
But when he frown'd it was against the French,25
Did will what he did spend and spent not that,25
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,25
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,25
Why uncle what's the matter?,25
Pardon me if you please; if n ot I pleased,25
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands,25
Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live?,25
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?,25
Take Hereford's rights away and take from Time,25
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;,25
But by fair sequence and succession?,25
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,25
By his attorneys-general to sue,25
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,25
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts,25
Think what you will we seize into our hands,25
I'll not be by the while: my liege farewell:,25
But by bad courses may be understood,25
Exit,25
Bid him repair to us to Ely House,25
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time I trow:,25
Our uncle York lord governor of England;,25
Come on our queen: to-morrow must we part;,25
Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II QUEEN DUKE OF AUMERLE BUSHY GREEN and BAGOT,25
And living too; for now his son is duke.,25
Richly in both if justice had her right.,25
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.,25
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!,25
If it be so out with it boldly man;,25
No good at all that I can do for him;,25
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.,25
In him a royal prince and many moe,25
The king is not himself but basely led,25
Merely in hate 'gainst any of us all,25
Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs.,25
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined,25
And daily new exactions are devised,25
But what o' God's name doth become of this?,25
But basely yielded upon compromise,25
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.,25
The king's grown bankrupt like a broken man.,25
He hath not money for these Irish wars,25
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.,25
But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing,25
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,25
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;,25
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.,25
I spy life peering; but I dare not say,25
Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.,25
We three are but thyself; and speaking so,25
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc a bay,25
That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham,25
His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury,25
Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,25
With eight tall ships three thousand men of war,25
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:,25
The first departing of the king for Ireland.,25
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,25
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt,25
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;,25
Stay and be secret and myself will go.,25
Hold out my horse and I will first be there.,25
SCENE II. The palace.,25
Madam your majesty is too much sad:,25
To lay aside life-harming heaviness,25
To please the king I did; to please myself,25
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,25
As my sweet Richard: yet again methinks,25
Is coming towards me and my inward soul,25
More than with parting from my lord the king.,25
Which shows like grief itself but is not so;,25
Divides one thing entire to many objects;,25
Show nothing but confusion eyed awry,25
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,25
Which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows,25
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;,25
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.,25
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,25
As though on thinking on no thought I think,25
Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady.,25
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,25
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:,25
But what it is that is not yet known; what,25
Enter GREEN,25
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.,25
For his designs crave haste his haste good hope:,25
That he our hope might have retired his power,25
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:,25
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived,25
Now God in heaven forbid!,25
The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy,25
With all their powerful friends are fled to him.,25
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?,25
Hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship,25
To Bolingbroke.,25
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:,25
And I a gasping new-deliver'd mother,25
Despair not madam.,25
I will despair and be at enmity,25
A parasite a keeper back of death,25
Which false hope lingers in extremity.,25
Here comes the Duke of York.,25
O full of careful business are his looks!,25
Should I do so I should belie my thoughts:,25
Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief.,25
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:,25
Who weak with age cannot support myself:,25
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.,25
My lord your son was gone before I came.,25
The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold,25
Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester;,25
Hold take my ring.,25
To-day as I came by I called there;,25
What is't knave?,25
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes,25
I know not what to do: I would to God,25
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.,25
How shall we do for money for these wars?,25
Go fellow get thee home provide some carts,25
Exit Servant,25
If I know how or which way to order these affairs,25
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:,25
And duty bids defend; the other again,25
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.,25
Dispose of you.,25
And meet me presently at Berkeley.,25
But time will not permit: all is uneven,25
Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN,25
But none returns. For us to levy power,25
Is all unpossible.,25
Is near the hate of those love not the king.,25
Lies in their purses and whoso empties them,25
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.,25
Because we ever have been near the king.,25
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.,25
The hateful commons will perform for us,25
Will you go along with us?,25
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,25
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.,25
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:,25
Farewell at once for once for all and ever.,25
I fear me never.,25
SCENE III. Wilds in Gloucestershire.,25
How far is it my lord to Berkeley now?,25
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:,25
Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,25
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.,25
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found,25
Which I protest hath very much beguiled,25
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have,25
And hope to joy is little less in joy,25
Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done,25
Of much less value is my company,25
Enter HENRY PERCY,25
Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever.,25
I had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you.,25
No my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,25
The household of the king.,25
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.,25
But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh,25
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover,25
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.,25
No my good lord for that is not forgot,25
I never in my life did look on him.,25
My gracious lord I tender you my service,25
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm,25
I thank thee gentle Percy; and be sure,25
As in a soul remembering my good friends;,25
It shall be still thy true love's recompense:,25
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir,25
There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees,25
And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour;,25
Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY,25
Bloody with spurring fiery-red with haste.,25
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury,25
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.,25
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.,25
Which till my infant fortune comes to years,25
Enter LORD BERKELEY,25
My Lord of Hereford my message is to you.,25
And I am come to seek that name in England;,25
Before I make reply to aught you say.,25
To raze one title of your honour out:,25
From the most gracious regent of this land,25
To take advantage of the absent time,25
Enter DUKE OF YORK attended,25
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!,25
Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee,25
My gracious uncle--,25
Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle:,25
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.,25
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?,25
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,25
And ostentation of despised arms?,25
Why foolish boy the king is left behind,25
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth,25
Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men,25
O then how quickly should this arm of mine.,25
And minister correction to thy fault!,25
On what condition stands it and wherein?,25
In gross rebellion and detested treason:,25
Before the expiration of thy time,25
As I was banish'd I was banish'd Hereford;,25
And noble uncle I beseech your grace,25
You are my father for methinks in you,25
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd,25
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away,25
If that my cousin king be King of England,25
You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin;,25
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,25
I am denied to sue my livery here,25
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,25
What would you have me do? I am a subject,25
And therefore personally I lay my claim,25
The noble duke hath been too much abused.,25
Base men by his endowments are made great.,25
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs,25
But in this kind to come in braving arms,25
To find out right with wrong it may not be;,25
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.,25
But for his own; and for the right of that,25
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!,25
I cannot mend it I must needs confess,25
But if I could by Him that gave me life,25
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;,25
I do remain as neuter. So fare you well;,25
And there repose you for this night.,25
But we must win your grace to go with us,25
By Bushy Bagot and their complices,25
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.,25
For I am loath to break our country's laws.,25
Things past redress are now with me past care.,25
SCENE IV. A camp in Wales.,25
My lord of Salisbury we have stay'd ten days,25
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;,25
Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman:,25
Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.,25
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;,25
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;,25
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,25
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.,25
As well assured Richard their king is dead.,25
Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind,25
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.,25
Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest:,25
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.,25
ACT III,25
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK  NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ROSS HENRY PERCY LORD WILLOUGHBY with BUSHY and GREEN prisoners,25
Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls--,25
With too much urging your pernicious lives,25
From off my hands here in the view of men,25
You have misled a prince a royal king,25
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:,25
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,25
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks,25
Myself a prince by fortune of my birth,25
Till you did make him misinterpret me,25
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,25
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,25
From my own windows torn my household coat,25
Save men's opinions and my living blood,25
This and much more much more than twice all this,25
To execution and the hand of death.,25
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords farewell.,25
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.,25
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others with the prisoners,25
For God's sake fairly let her be entreated:,25
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.,25
With letters of your love to her at large.,25
To fight with Glendower and his complices:,25
Exeunt,25
Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD II the BISHOP OF CARLISLE DUKE OF AUMERLE and Soldiers,25
Yea my lord. How brooks your grace the air,25
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy,25
Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand,25
As a long-parted mother with her child,25
So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth,25
Feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth,25
But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom,25
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,25
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;,25
Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder,25
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.,25
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones,25
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.,25
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.,25
And not neglected; else if heaven would,25
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.,25
Whilst Bolingbroke through our security,25
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not,25
Behind the globe that lights the lower world,25
In murders and in outrage boldly here;,25
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines,25
Then murders treasons and detested sins,25
Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves?,25
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,25
Shall see us rising in our throne the east,25
Not able to endure the sight of day,25
Not all the water in the rough rude sea,25
The breath of worldly men cannot depose,25
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd,25
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay,25
Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right.,25
Welcome my lord how far off lies your power?,25
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue,25
One day too late I fear me noble lord,25
O call back yesterday bid time return,25
To-day to-day unhappy day too late,25
For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead.,25
Comfort my liege; why looks your grace so pale?,25
Did triumph in my face and they are fled;,25
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?,25
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.,25
I had forgot myself; am I not king?,25
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?,25
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,25
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York,25
Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,25
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!,25
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.,25
And what loss is it to be rid of care?,25
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,25
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;,25
Cry woe destruction ruin and decay:,25
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd,25
Like an unseasonable stormy day,25
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,25
Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land,25
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps,25
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints,25
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows,25
Yea distaff-women manage rusty bills,25
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.,25
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?,25
That they have let the dangerous enemy,25
If we prevail their heads shall pay for it:,25
Peace have they made with him indeed my lord.,25
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man!,25
Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas!,25
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!,25
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:,25
With heads and not with hands; those whom you curse,25
And lie full low graved in the hollow ground.,25
Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads.,25
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:,25
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes,25
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:,25
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?,25
And nothing can we call our own but death,25
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.,25
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;,25
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;,25
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown,25
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,25
Allowing him a breath a little scene,25
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,25
Were brass impregnable and humour'd thus,25
Bores through his castle wall and farewell king!,25
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,25
For you have but mistook me all this while:,25
Taste grief need friends: subjected thus,25
My lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,25
To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength,25
And so your follies fight against yourself.,25
And fight and die is death destroying death;,25
My father hath a power; inquire of him,25
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke I come,25
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;,25
Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power?,25
Men judge by the complexion of the sky,25
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,25
I play the torturer by small and small,25
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,25
And all your southern gentlemen in arms,25
Thou hast said enough.,25
To DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
What say you now? what comfort have we now?,25
That bids me be of comfort any more.,25
A king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey.,25
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,25
To alter this for counsel is but vain.,25
He does me double wrong,25
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,25
Exeunt,25
Enter with drum and colours HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK NORTHUMBERLAND Attendants and forces,25
The Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury,25
With some few private friends upon this coast.,25
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.,25
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day,25
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief,25
The time hath been,25
Have been so brief with you to shorten you,25
Mistake not uncle further than you should.,25
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.,25
Against their will. But who comes here?,25
Welcome Harry: what will not this castle yield?,25
Against thy entrance.,25
Why it contains no king?,25
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies,25
And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury,25
Of holy reverence; who I cannot learn.,25
Noble lords,25
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley,25
Henry Bolingbroke,25
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart,25
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,25
And lands restored again be freely granted:,25
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood,25
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke,25
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,25
Go signify as much while here we march,25
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,25
Our fair appointments may be well perused.,25
With no less terror than the elements,25
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.,25
The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain,25
March on and mark King Richard how he looks.,25
See see King Richard doth himself appear,25
From out the fiery portal of the east,25
To dim his glory and to stain the track,25
Yet looks he like a king: behold his eye,25
Controlling majesty: alack alack for woe,25
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood,25
To NORTHUMBERLAND,25
And if we be how dare thy joints forget,25
If we be not show us the hand of God,25
For well we know no hand of blood and bone,25
Unless he do profane steal or usurp.,25
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,25
Yet know my master God omnipotent,25
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike,25
That lift your vassal hands against my head,25
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--,25
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open,25
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,25
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,25
To scarlet indignation and bedew,25
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king,25
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin,25
And by the honourable tomb he swears,25
And by the royalties of both your bloods,25
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,25
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,25
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg,25
Which on thy royal party granted once,25
His barbed steeds to stables and his heart,25
This swears he as he is a prince is just;,25
Northumberland say thus the king returns:,25
And all the number of his fair demands,25
With all the gracious utterance thou hast,25
We do debase ourselves cousin do we not,25
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?,25
Defiance to the traitor and so die?,25
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.,25
That laid the sentence of dread banishment,25
With words of sooth! O that I were as great,25
Or that I could forget what I have been,25
Swell'st thou proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,25
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.,25
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?,25
The name of king? o' God's name let it go:,25
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,25
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,25
My subjects for a pair of carved saints,25
A little little grave an obscure grave;,25
Some way of common trade where subjects' feet,25
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;,25
Aumerle thou weep'st my tender-hearted cousin!,25
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,25
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,25
As thus to drop them still upon one place,25
Within the earth; and therein laid--there lies,25
Would not this ill do well? Well well I see,25
Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland,25
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?,25
My lord in the base court he doth attend,25
Down down I come; like glistering Phaethon,25
In the base court? Base court where kings grow base,25
In the base court? Come down? Down court!,25
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks,25
Exeunt from above,25
Sorrow and grief of heart,25
Yet he is come.,25
Stand all apart,25
He kneels down,25
Fair cousin you debase your princely knee,25
Me rather had my heart might feel your love,25
Up cousin up; your heart is up I know,25
My gracious lord I come but for mine own.,25
So far be mine my most redoubted lord,25
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,25
Uncle give me your hands: nay dry your eyes;,25
Cousin I am too young to be your father,25
What you will have I'll give and willing too;,25
Set on towards London cousin is it so?,25
Then I must not say no.,25
SCENE IV. LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.,25
What sport shall we devise here in this garden,25
Madam we'll play at bowls.,25
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.,25
My legs can keep no measure in delight,25
Therefore no dancing girl; some other sport.,25
Of sorrow or of joy?,25
Of neither girl:,25
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;,25
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:,25
And what I want it boots not to complain.,25
Tis well that thou hast cause,25
I could weep madam would it do you good.,25
And never borrow any tear of thee.,25
But stay here come the gardeners:,25
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,25
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.,25
Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,25
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:,25
Go thou and like an executioner,25
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:,25
You thus employ'd I will go root away,25
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.,25
Keep law and form and due proportion,25
When our sea-walled garden the whole land,25
Her fruit-trees all upturned her hedges ruin'd,25
Swarming with caterpillars?,25
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring,25
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,25
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,25
What are they dead?,25
Hath seized the wasteful king. O what pity is it,25
As we this garden! We at time of year,25
Lest being over-proud in sap and blood,25
Had he done so to great and growing men,25
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches,25
Had he done so himself had borne the crown,25
What think you then the king shall be deposed?,25
Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night,25
That tell black tidings.,25
Coming forward,25
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?,25
To make a second fall of cursed man?,25
Darest thou thou little better thing than earth,25
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak thou wretch.,25
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.,25
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:,25
And some few vanities that make him light;,25
Besides himself are all the English peers,25
Post you to London and you will find it so;,25
Nimble mischance that art so light of foot,25
And am I last that knows it? O thou think'st,25
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come ladies go,25
What was I born to this that my sad look,25
Gardener for telling me these news of woe,25
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies,25
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.,25
I'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace:,25
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.,25
ACT IV,25
Enter as to the Parliament HENRY BOLINGBROKE  DUKE OF AUMERLE NORTHUMBERLAND HENRY PERCY LORD  FITZWATER DUKE OF SURREY the BISHOP OF CARLISLE  the Abbot Of Westminster and another Lord Herald Officers and BAGOT,25
Now Bagot freely speak thy mind;,25
Who wrought it with the king and who perform'd,25
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.,25
My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue,25
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,25
That reacheth from the restful English court,25
Amongst much other talk that very time,25
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns,25
Adding withal how blest this land would be,25
Princes and noble lords,25
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,25
Either I must or have mine honour soil'd,25
There is my gage the manual seal of death,25
And will maintain what thou hast said is false,25
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.,25
Excepting one I would he were the best,25
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,25
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,25
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.,25
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,25
Thou darest not coward live to see that day.,25
Fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this.,25
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;,25
To prove it on thee to the extremest point,25
An if I do not may my hands rot off,25
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!,25
And spur thee on with full as many lies,25
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;,25
Who sets me else? by heaven I'll throw at all:,25
To answer twenty thousand such as you.,25
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.,25
And you can witness with me this is true.,25
Surrey thou liest.,25
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,25
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie,25
In proof whereof there is my honour's pawn;,25
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!,25
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,25
And lies and lies: there is my bond of faith,25
As I intend to thrive in this new world,25
Besides I heard the banish'd Norfolk say,25
To execute the noble duke at Calais.,25
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,25
These differences shall all rest under gage,25
And though mine enemy restored again,25
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.,25
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought,25
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross,25
And toil'd with works of war retired himself,25
His body to that pleasant country's earth,25
Under whose colours he had fought so long.,25
As surely as I live my lord.,25
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,25
Till we assign you to your days of trial.,25
Great Duke of Lancaster I come to thee,25
Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields,25
Ascend his throne descending now from him;,25
In God's name I'll ascend the regal throne.,25
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,25
Would God that any in this noble presence,25
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would,25
What subject can give sentence on his king?,25
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,25
And shall the figure of God's majesty,25
Anointed crowned planted many years,25
And he himself not present? O forfend it God,25
Should show so heinous black obscene a deed!,25
Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king:,25
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:,25
The blood of English shall manure the ground,25
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,25
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;,25
Shall here inhabit and this land be call'd,25
O if you raise this house against this house,25
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.,25
Lest child child's children cry against you woe!,25
Of capital treason we arrest you here.,25
To keep him safely till his day of trial.,25
Fetch hither Richard that in common view,25
Without suspicion.,25
Exit,25
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.,25
And little look'd for at your helping hands.,25
Alack why am I sent for to a king,25
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd,25
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me,25
The favours of these men: were they not mine?,25
So Judas did to Christ: but he in twelve,25
God save the king! Will no man say amen?,25
God save the king! although I be not he;,25
To do what service am I sent for hither?,25
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,25
To Henry Bolingbroke.,25
Here cousin:,25
Now is this golden crown like a deep well,25
The emptier ever dancing in the air,25
That bucket down and full of tears am I,25
I thought you had been willing to resign.,25
You may my glories and my state depose,25
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.,25
My care is loss of care by old care done;,25
The cares I give I have though given away;,25
Are you contented to resign the crown?,25
Therefore no no for I resign to thee.,25
I give this heavy weight from off my head,25
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;,25
With mine own hands I give away my crown,25
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:,25
My manors rents revenues I forego;,25
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!,25
Make me that nothing have with nothing grieved,25
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,25
God save King Harry unking'd Richard says,25
What more remains?,25
These accusations and these grievous crimes,25
Against the state and profit of this land;,25
May deem that you are worthily deposed.,25
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,25
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop,25
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,25
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,25
Nay all of you that stand and look upon,25
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands,25
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,25
My lord dispatch; read o'er these articles.,25
And yet salt water blinds them not so much,25
Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself,25
For I have given here my soul's consent,25
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,25
My lord--,25
Nor no man's lord; I have no name no title,25
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,25
And know not now what name to call myself!,25
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,25
Good king great king and yet not greatly good,25
Let it command a mirror hither straight,25
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.,25
Exit an attendant,25
Fiend thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!,25
The commons will not then be satisfied.,25
When I do see the very book indeed,25
Re-enter Attendant with a glass,25
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck,25
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,25
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face,25
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face,25
Was this the face that faced so many follies,25
A brittle glory shineth in this face:,25
Dashes the glass against the ground,25
Mark silent king the moral of this sport,25
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd,25
Say that again.,25
Tis very true my grief lies all within;,25
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief,25
There lies the substance: and I thank thee king,25
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way,25
And then be gone and trouble you no more.,25
Name it fair cousin.,25
For when I was a king my flatterers,25
I have a king here to my flatterer.,25
Yet ask.,25
You shall.,25
Whither?,25
Go some of you convey him to the Tower.,25
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.,25
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down,25
Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE the Abbot of Westminster and DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.,25
You holy clergymen is there no plot,25
My lord,25
You shall not only take the sacrament,25
Whatever I shall happen to devise.,25
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:,25
A plot shall show us all a merry day.,25
ACT V,25
Enter QUEEN and Ladies,25
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,25
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:,25
Have any resting for her true king's queen.,25
But soft but see or rather do not see,25
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,25
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand,25
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,25
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?,25
To make my end too sudden: learn good soul,25
From which awaked the truth of what we are,25
To grim Necessity and he and I,25
And cloister thee in some religious house:,25
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.,25
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed,25
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,25
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou pupil-like,25
And fawn on rage with base humility,25
A king of beasts indeed; if aught but beasts,25
Good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France:,25
As from my death-bed thy last living leave.,25
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales,25
And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs,25
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:,25
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,25
And some will mourn in ashes some coal-black,25
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others,25
You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower.,25
With all swift speed you must away to France.,25
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,25
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head,25
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,25
And he shall think that thou which know'st the way,25
Being ne'er so little urged another way,25
The love of wicked men converts to fear;,25
To worthy danger and deserved death.,25
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.,25
A twofold marriage 'twixt my crown and me,25
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;,25
Part us Northumberland; I toward the north,25
My wife to France: from whence set forth in pomp,25
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.,25
Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart.,25
That were some love but little policy.,25
So two together weeping make one woe.,25
Better far off than near be ne'er the near.,25
So longest way shall have the longest moans.,25
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.,25
Since wedding it there is such length in grief;,25
Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart.,25
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.,25
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.,25
Once more adieu; the rest let sorrow say.,25
SCENE II. The DUKE OF YORK's palace.,25
My lord you told me you would tell the rest,25
of our two cousins coming into London.,25
At that sad stop my lord,25
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.,25
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,25
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,25
Bolingbroke!',25
So many greedy looks of young and old,25
Upon his visage and that all the walls,25
Jesu preserve thee! welcome Bolingbroke!',25
Bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck,25
And thus still doing thus he pass'd along.,25
As in a theatre the eyes of men,25
Are idly bent on him that enters next,25
Even so or with much more contempt men's eyes,25
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:,25
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,25
The badges of his grief and patience,25
The hearts of men they must perforce have melted,25
But heaven hath a hand in these events,25
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,25
Here comes my son Aumerle.,25
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,25
I am in parliament pledge for his truth,25
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?,25
God knows I had as lief be none as one.,25
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.,25
For aught I know my lord they do.,25
If God prevent not I purpose so.,25
Yea look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.,25
No matter then who see it;,25
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:,25
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.,25
I fear I fear--,25
Tis nothing but some bond that he is enter'd into,25
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond,25
Boy let me see the writing.,25
I will be satisfied; let me see it I say.,25
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!,25
Ho! who is within there?,25
Saddle my horse.,25
Why what is it my lord?,25
Now by mine honour by my life by my troth,25
What is the matter?,25
I will not peace. What is the matter Aumerle.,25
Than my poor life must answer.,25
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.,25
Strike him Aumerle. Poor boy thou art amazed.,25
Give me my boots I say.,25
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?,25
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?,25
And rob me of a happy mother's name?,25
Thou fond mad woman,25
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,25
To kill the king at Oxford.,25
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?,25
I would appeach him.,25
As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful.,25
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,25
Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind:,25
Not like to me or any of my kin,25
Make way unruly woman!,25
After Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;,25
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.,25
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:,25
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away be gone!,25
SCENE III. A royal palace.,25
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?,25
If any plague hang over us 'tis he.,25
Inquire at London 'mongst the taverns there,25
With unrestrained loose companions,25
And beat our watch and rob our passengers;,25
Takes on the point of honour to support,25
My lord some two days since I saw the prince,25
And what said the gallant?,25
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,25
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.,25
I see some sparks of better hope which elder years,25
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
What means our cousin that he stares and looks,25
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,25
Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone.,25
What is the matter with our cousin now?,25
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,25
Intended or committed was this fault?,25
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.,25
That no man enter till my tale be done.,25
[Within]  My liege beware; look to thyself;,25
Villain I'll make thee safe.,25
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.,25
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?,25
Enter DUKE OF YORK,25
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,25
Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know,25
Remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd:,25
My heart is not confederate with my hand.,25
I tore it from the traitor's bosom king;,25
Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove,25
O heinous strong and bold conspiracy!,25
Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain,25
Hath held his current and defiled himself!,25
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse,25
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;,25
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.,25
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:,25
The traitor lives the true man's put to death.,25
let me in.,25
A woman and thy aunt great king; 'tis I.,25
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.,25
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.',25
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.,25
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.,25
This let alone will all the rest confound.,25
O king believe not this hard-hearted man!,25
Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here?,25
Sweet York be patient. Hear me gentle liege.,25
Rise up good aunt.,25
For ever will I walk upon my knees,25
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,25
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.,25
Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace!,25
His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest;,25
He prays but faintly and would be denied;,25
His weary joints would gladly rise I know;,25
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;,25
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have,25
Good aunt stand up.,25
Say 'pardon' first and afterwards 'stand up.',25
Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.,25
Say 'pardon' king; let pity teach thee how:,25
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.,25
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?,25
That set'st the word itself against the word!,25
The chopping French we do not understand.,25
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;,25
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.,25
I do not sue to stand;,25
I pardon him as God shall pardon me.,25
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;,25
But makes one pardon strong.,25
I pardon him.,25
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,25
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.,25
To Oxford or where'er these traitors are:,25
But I will have them if I once know where.,25
Your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true.,25
Exeunt,25
Enter EXTON and Servant,25
Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?',25
These were his very words.,25
And urged it twice together did he not?,25
And speaking it he wistly look'd on me,25
That would divorce this terror from my heart;',25
I am the king's friend and will rid his foe.,25
SCENE V. Pomfret castle.,25
I have been studying how I may compare,25
And for because the world is populous,25
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.,25
My soul the father; and these two beget,25
And these same thoughts people this little world,25
For no thought is contented. The better sort,25
With scruples and do set the word itself,25
As thus 'Come little ones' and then again,25
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.',25
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails,25
Of this hard world my ragged prison walls,25
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves,25
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars,25
That many have and others must sit there;,25
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back,25
Thus play I in one person many people,25
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,25
Persuades me I was better when a king;,25
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,25
Nor I nor any man that but man is,25
With being nothing. Music do I hear?,25
Ha ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,25
So is it in the music of men's lives.,25
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;,25
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.,25
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:,25
Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch,25
Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears.,25
Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,25
Show minutes times and hours: but my time,25
While I stand fooling here his Jack o' the clock.,25
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,25
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!,25
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.,25
Hail royal prince!,25
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.,25
Where no man never comes but that sad dog,25
I was a poor groom of thy stable king,25
With much ado at length have gotten leave,25
O how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld,25
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,25
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!,25
How went he under him?,25
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!,25
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.,25
Since pride must have a fall and break the neck,25
Forgiveness horse! why do I rail on thee,25
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;,25
Spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.,25
Fellow give place; here is no longer stay.,25
What my tongue dares not that my heart shall say.,25
My lord will't please you to fall to?,25
My lord I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton who,25
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!,25
Beats the keeper,25
Enter EXTON and Servants armed,25
Villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.,25
Go thou and fill another room in hell.,25
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire,25
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.,25
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die.,25
As full of valour as of royal blood:,25
For now the devil that told me I did well,25
This dead king to the living king I'll bear,25
Exeunt,25
Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF YORK with other Lords and Attendants,25
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire,25
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.,25
Welcome my lord what is the news?,25
The next news is I have to London sent,25
The manner of their taking may appear,25
We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains;,25
Enter LORD FITZWATER,25
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,25
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.,25
Right noble is thy merit well I wot.,25
The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster,25
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;,25
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.,25
Choose out some secret place some reverend room,25
So as thou livest in peace die free from strife:,25
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.,25
Great king within this coffin I present,25
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,25
Exton I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought,25
Upon my head and all this famous land.,25
They love not poison that do poison need,25
I hate the murderer love him murdered.,25
But neither my good word nor princely favour:,25
And never show thy head by day nor light.,25
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:,25
And put on sullen black incontinent:,25
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:,25
In weeping after this untimely bier.,25
ACT I,26
Enter GLOUCESTER solus,26
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;,26
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.,26
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;,26
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.,26
And now instead of mounting barded steeds,26
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber,26
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks,26
I that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty,26
I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,26
Deformed unfinish'd sent before my time,26
And that so lamely and unfashionable,26
Why I in this weak piping time of peace,26
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun,26
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover,26
I am determined to prove a villain,26
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous,26
To set my brother Clarence and the king,26
And if King Edward be as true and just,26
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,26
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.,26
Clarence comes.,26
Brother good day; what means this armed guard,26
His majesty,26
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.,26
Because my name is George.,26
He should for that commit your godfathers:,26
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.,26
Yea Richard when I know; for I protest,26
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;,26
And says a wizard told him that by G,26
And for my name of George begins with G,26
These as I learn and such like toys as these,26
Why this it is when men are ruled by women:,26
My Lady Grey his wife Clarence 'tis she,26
Was it not she and that good man of worship,26
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,26
We are not safe Clarence; we are not safe.,26
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds,26
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant,26
Humbly complaining to her deity,26
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,26
To be her men and wear her livery:,26
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.,26
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;,26
That no man shall have private conference,26
Even so; an't please your worship Brakenbury,26
We speak no treason man: we say the king,26
Well struck in years fair and not jealous;,26
A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue;,26
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?,26
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee fellow,26
Were best he do it secretly alone.,26
Her husband knave: wouldst thou betray me?,26
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.,26
We are the queen's abjects and must obey.,26
And whatsoever you will employ me in,26
I will perform it to enfranchise you.,26
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.,26
Well your imprisonment shall not be long;,26
I must perforce. Farewell.,26
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.,26
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,26
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?,26
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!,26
Well are you welcome to the open air.,26
With patience noble lord as prisoners must:,26
That were the cause of my imprisonment.,26
For they that were your enemies are his,26
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,26
What news abroad?,26
The King is sickly weak and melancholy,26
Now by Saint Paul this news is bad indeed.,26
And overmuch consumed his royal person:,26
What is he in his bed?,26
Go you before and I will follow you.,26
He cannot live I hope; and must not die,26
I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence,26
And if I fall not in my deep intent,26
Which done God take King Edward to his mercy,26
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.,26
The readiest way to make the wench amends,26
The which will I; not all so much for love,26
By marrying her which I must reach unto.,26
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:,26
Exit,26
Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner,26
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,26
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.,26
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!,26
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,26
Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughter'd son,26
Lo in these windows that let forth thy life,26
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!,26
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!,26
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,26
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!,26
Prodigious and untimely brought to light,26
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;,26
If ever he have wife let her he made,26
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!,26
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;,26
Rest you whiles I lament King Henry's corse.,26
Stay you that bear the corse and set it down.,26
To stop devoted charitable deeds?,26
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.,26
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou when I command:,26
Or by Saint Paul I'll strike thee to my foot,26
What do you tremble? are you all afraid?,26
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.,26
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,26
Sweet saint for charity be not so curst.,26
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,26
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,26
O gentlemen see see! dead Henry's wounds,26
Blush Blush thou lump of foul deformity;,26
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;,26
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.,26
O earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death!,26
murderer dead,26
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,26
Lady you know no rules of charity,26
Villain thou know'st no law of God nor man:,26
But I know none and therefore am no beast.,26
More wonderful when angels are so angry.,26
Of these supposed-evils to give me leave,26
Vouchsafe defused infection of a man,26
By circumstance to curse thy cursed self.,26
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.,26
No excuse current but to hang thyself.,26
And by despairing shouldst thou stand excused;,26
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.,26
Why then they are not dead:,26
I did not kill your husband.,26
Nay he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.,26
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;,26
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.,26
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.,26
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:,26
I grant ye.,26
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!,26
The fitter for the King of heaven that hath him.,26
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither;,26
And thou unfit for any place but hell.,26
Some dungeon.,26
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!,26
I hope so.,26
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,26
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths,26
As blameful as the executioner?,26
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;,26
To undertake the death of all the world,26
If I thought that I tell thee homicide,26
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;,26
As all the world is cheered by the sun,26
Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life!,26
I would I were to be revenged on thee.,26
To be revenged on him that loveth you.,26
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.,26
Did it to help thee to a better husband.,26
He lives that loves thee better than he could.,26
Plantagenet.,26
The selfsame name but one of better nature.,26
Here.,26
Why dost thou spit at me?,26
Never came poison from so sweet a place.,26
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.,26
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!,26
For now they kill me with a living death.,26
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:,26
No when my father York and Edward wept,26
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;,26
Told the sad story of my father's death,26
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,26
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;,26
Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping.,26
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;,26
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak.,26
Teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made,26
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,26
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.,26
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,26
He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword,26
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.,26
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.,26
Take up the sword again or take up me.,26
I will not be the executioner.,26
I have already.,26
Speak it again and even with the word,26
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;,26
I would I knew thy heart.,26
I fear me both are false.,26
Well well put up your sword.,26
That shall you know hereafter.,26
All men I hope live so.,26
To take is not to give.,26
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;,26
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may,26
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.,26
That it would please thee leave these sad designs,26
And presently repair to Crosby Place;,26
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,26
I will with all expedient duty see you:,26
Grant me this boon.,26
To see you are become so penitent.,26
Bid me farewell.,26
But since you teach me how to flatter you,26
Exeunt LADY ANNE TRESSEL and BERKELEY,26
Towards Chertsey noble lord?,26
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER,26
Was ever woman in this humour won?,26
What! I that kill'd her husband and his father,26
With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes,26
Having God her conscience and these bars,26
And I nothing to back my suit at all,26
And yet to win her all the world to nothing!,26
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,26
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?,26
Framed in the prodigality of nature,26
The spacious world cannot again afford,26
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,26
On me whose all not equals Edward's moiety?,26
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,26
Upon my life she finds although I cannot,26
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,26
To study fashions to adorn my body:,26
Will maintain it with some little cost.,26
And then return lamenting to my love.,26
That I may see my shadow as I pass.,26
SCENE III. The palace.,26
Have patience madam: there's no doubt his majesty,26
In that you brook it in it makes him worse:,26
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.,26
No other harm but loss of such a lord.,26
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,26
Oh he is young and his minority,26
A man that loves not me nor none of you.,26
It is determined not concluded yet:,26
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY,26
Good time of day unto your royal grace!,26
The Countess Richmond good my Lord of Derby.,26
Yet Derby notwithstanding she's your wife,26
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.,26
The envious slanders of her false accusers;,26
Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds,26
Saw you the king to-day my Lord of Derby?,26
Are come from visiting his majesty.,26
Madam good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.,26
Madam we did: he desires to make atonement,26
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;,26
Would all were well! but that will never be,26
Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and DORSET,26
Who are they that complain unto the king,26
By holy Paul they love his grace but lightly,26
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,26
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,26
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,26
By silken sly insinuating Jacks?,26
To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace.,26
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?,26
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--,26
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.,26
The king of his own royal disposition,26
Aiming belike at your interior hatred,26
Against my kindred brothers and myself,26
The ground of your ill-will and so remove it.,26
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:,26
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.,26
Gloucester;,26
God grant we never may have need of you!,26
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,26
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions,26
That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.,26
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,26
Against the Duke of Clarence but have been,26
My lord you do me shameful injury,26
You may deny that you were not the cause,26
She may my lord for--,26
She may do more sir than denying that:,26
And then deny her aiding hand therein,26
What may she not? She may yea marry may she--,26
What marry may she! marry with a king,26
I wis your grandam had a worser match.,26
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:,26
With those gross taunts I often have endured.,26
Than a great queen with this condition,26
Enter QUEEN MARGARET behind,26
And lessen'd be that small God I beseech thee!,26
What! threat you me with telling of the king?,26
I will avouch in presence of the king:,26
Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.,26
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,26
Ere you were queen yea or your husband king,26
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,26
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.,26
In all which time you and your husband Grey,26
And Rivers so were you. Was not your husband,26
Let me put in your minds if you forget,26
Withal what I have been and what I am.,26
Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick;,26
Which God revenge!,26
And for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up.,26
Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine,26
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world,26
My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days,26
We follow'd then our lord our lawful king:,26
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:,26
As little joy my lord as you suppose,26
As little joy may you suppose in me.,26
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;,26
I can no longer hold me patient.,26
Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out,26
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?,26
Yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels?,26
Foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight?,26
That will I make before I let thee go.,26
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment,26
A husband and a son thou owest to me;,26
The sorrow that I have by right is yours,26
The curse my noble father laid on thee,26
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,26
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--,26
Denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee;,26
So just is God to right the innocent.,26
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!,26
No man but prophesied revenge for it.,26
What were you snarling all before I came,26
And turn you all your hatred now on me?,26
That Henry's death my lovely Edward's death,26
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?,26
Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses!,26
As ours by murder to make him a king!,26
For Edward my son which was Prince of Wales,26
Thyself a queen for me that was a queen,26
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;,26
Deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine!,26
And after many lengthen'd hours of grief,26
Rivers and Dorset you were standers by,26
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God I pray him,26
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!,26
And leave out thee? stay dog for thou shalt hear me.,26
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,26
And then hurl down their indignation,26
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!,26
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!,26
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream,26
Thou elvish-mark'd abortive rooting hog!,26
The slave of nature and the son of hell!,26
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!,26
Margaret.,26
Ha!,26
I cry thee mercy then for I had thought,26
Why so I did; but look'd for no reply.,26
Tis done by me and ends in 'Margaret.',26
Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune!,26
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?,26
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me,26
False-boding woman end thy frantic curse,26
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.,26
To serve me well you all should do me duty,26
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty!,26
Peace master marquess you are malapert:,26
O that your young nobility could judge,26
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;,26
Good counsel marry: learn it learn it marquess.,26
Yea and much more: but I was born so high,26
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.,26
Witness my son now in the shade of death;,26
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.,26
O God that seest it do not suffer it!,26
Have done! for shame if not for charity.,26
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,26
My charity is outrage life my shame,26
Have done have done.,26
In sign of league and amity with thee:,26
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,26
Nor no one here; for curses never pass,26
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,26
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog!,26
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:,26
Sin death and hell have set their marks on him,26
What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham?,26
What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?,26
O but remember this another day,26
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!,26
And he to yours and all of you to God's!,26
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.,26
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,26
My part thereof that I have done to her.,26
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.,26
That is too cold in thinking of it now.,26
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains,26
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,26
So do I ever:,26
being well-advised.,26
Enter CATESBY,26
And for your grace; and you my noble lords.,26
Madam we will attend your grace.,26
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.,26
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.,26
I do beweep to many simple gulls,26
And say it is the queen and her allies,26
Now they believe it; and withal whet me,26
But then I sigh; and with a piece of scripture,26
And thus I clothe my naked villany,26
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.,26
But soft! here come my executioners.,26
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?,26
That we may be admitted where he is.,26
Gives the warrant,26
But sirs be sudden in the execution,26
For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps,26
Tush!,26
Talkers are no good doers: be assured,26
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes drop tears:,26
Go go dispatch.,26
Exeunt,26
Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY,26
O I have pass'd a miserable night,26
That as I am a Christian faithful man,26
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,26
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.,26
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;,26
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk,26
And cited up a thousand fearful times,26
That had befall'n us. As we paced along,26
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and in falling,26
Into the tumbling billows of the main.,26
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!,26
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;,26
Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl,26
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:,26
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,26
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,26
Had you such leisure in the time of death,26
Methought I had; and often did I strive,26
Kept in my soul and would not let it forth,26
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,26
Awaked you not with this sore agony?,26
O then began the tempest to my soul,26
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,26
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,26
Who cried aloud 'What scourge for perjury,26
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by,26
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,26
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;,26
With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends,26
Such hideous cries that with the very noise,26
Could not believe but that I was in hell,26
No marvel my lord though it affrighted you;,26
O Brakenbury I have done those things,26
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!,26
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,26
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!,26
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep.,26
CLARENCE sleeps,26
Makes the night morning and the noon-tide night.,26
An outward honour for an inward toil;,26
They often feel a world of restless cares:,26
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.,26
Ho! who's here?,26
I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs.,26
O sir it is better to be brief than tedious. Show,26
BRAKENBURY reads it,26
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:,26
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.,26
I'll to the king; and signify to him,26
Do so it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.,26
What shall we stab him as he sleeps?,26
When he wakes! why fool he shall never wake till,26
Why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.,26
of remorse in me.,26
Not to kill him having a warrant for it; but to be,26
I thought thou hadst been resolute.,26
Back to the Duke of Gloucester tell him so.,26
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one,26
How dost thou feel thyself now?,26
within me.,26
Zounds he dies: I had forgot the reward.,26
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.,26
thy conscience flies out.,26
How if it come to thee again?,26
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal but it,26
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it,26
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of,26
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it,26
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live,26
without it.,26
not to kill the duke.,26
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.,26
I warrant thee.,26
reputation. Come shall we to this gear?,26
sword and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt,26
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.,26
No first let's reason with him.,26
You shall have wine enough my lord anon.,26
A man as you are.,26
Nor you as we are loyal.,26
My voice is now the king's my looks mine own.,26
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?,26
To to to--,26
Ay ay.,26
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.,26
Offended us you have not but the king.,26
Never my lord; therefore prepare to die.,26
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?,26
What lawful quest have given their verdict up,26
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?,26
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.,26
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,26
The deed you undertake is damnable.,26
And he that hath commanded is the king.,26
Hath in the tables of his law commanded,26
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?,26
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.,26
For false forswearing and for murder too:,26
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.,26
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade,26
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.,26
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?,26
For Edward for my brother for his sake: Why sirs,26
For in this sin he is as deep as I.,26
O know you yet he doth it publicly,26
He needs no indirect nor lawless course,26
Who made thee then a bloody minister,26
That princely novice was struck dead by thee?,26
Thy brother's love our duty and thy fault,26
Oh if you love my brother hate not me;,26
If you be hired for meed go back again,26
Who shall reward you better for my life,26
You are deceived your brother Gloucester hates you.,26
Go you to him from me.,26
Tell him when that our princely father York,26
And charged us from his soul to love each other,26
Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep.,26
O do not slander him for he is kind.,26
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:,26
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,26
That he would labour my delivery.,26
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.,26
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,26
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,26
Ah sirs consider he that set you on,26
What shall we do?,26
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.,26
Which of you if you were a prince's son,26
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,26
My friend I spy some pity in thy looks:,26
Come thou on my side and entreat for me,26
A begging prince what beggar pities not?,26
Take that and that: if all this will not do,26
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.,26
A bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd!,26
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!,26
How now! what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not?,26
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!,26
For I repent me that the duke is slain.,26
So do not I: go coward as thou art.,26
Until the duke take order for his burial:,26
For this will out and here I must not stay.,26
SCENE I. London. The palace.,26
Why so: now have I done a good day's work:,26
I every day expect an embassage,26
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,26
Rivers and Hastings take each other's hand;,26
By heaven my heart is purged from grudging hate:,26
So thrive I as I truly swear the like!,26
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings,26
Either of you to be the other's end.,26
And I as I love Hastings with my heart!,26
Nor your son Dorset Buckingham nor you;,26
Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand;,26
Here Hastings; I will never more remember,26
Dorset embrace him; Hastings love lord marquess.,26
Upon my part shall be unviolable.,26
They embrace,26
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,26
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate,26
To the Queen,26
Doth cherish you and yours God punish me,26
When I have most need to employ a friend,26
Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile,26
When I am cold in zeal to yours.,26
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.,26
To make the perfect period of this peace.,26
Enter GLOUCESTER,26
And princely peers a happy time of day!,26
Brother we done deeds of charity;,26
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.,26
Amongst this princely heap if any here,26
Hold me a foe;,26
Have aught committed that is hardly borne,26
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:,26
I hate it and desire all good men's love.,26
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;,26
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;,26
That without desert have frown'd on me;,26
I do not know that Englishman alive,26
More than the infant that is born to-night,26
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:,26
My sovereign liege I do beseech your majesty,26
Why madam have I offer'd love for this,26
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?,26
You do him injury to scorn his corse.,26
All seeing heaven what a world is this!,26
Ay my good lord; and no one in this presence,26
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.,26
And that a winged Mercury did bear:,26
That came too lag to see him buried.,26
Nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood,26
And yet go current from suspicion!,26
A boon my sovereign for my service done!,26
I will not rise unless your highness grant.,26
The forfeit sovereign of my servant's life;,26
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.,26
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?,26
And yet his punishment was cruel death.,26
Kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised,26
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake,26
Who told me in the field by Tewksbury,26
And said 'Dear brother live and be a king'?,26
Frozen almost to death how he did lap me,26
All thin and naked to the numb cold night?,26
Sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you,26
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals,26
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,26
And I unjustly too must grant it you,26
Nor I ungracious speak unto myself,26
Have been beholding to him in his life;,26
O God I fear thy justice will take hold,26
Come Hastings help me to my closet.,26
Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET,26
How that the guilty kindred of the queen,26
O they did urge it still unto the king!,26
To comfort Edward with our company.,26
Exeunt,26
Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK with the two children of CLARENCE,26
No boy.,26
And cry 'O Clarence my unhappy son!',26
And call us wretches orphans castaways,26
My pretty cousins you mistake me much;,26
As loath to lose him not your father's death;,26
Then grandam you conclude that he is dead.,26
God will revenge it; whom I will importune,26
And so will I.,26
Incapable and shallow innocents,26
Grandam we can; for my good uncle Gloucester,26
Devised impeachments to imprison him :,26
And hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek;,26
And he would love me dearly as his child.,26
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!,26
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.,26
Ay boy.,26
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH with her hair about her ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her,26
To chide my fortune and torment myself?,26
And to myself become an enemy.,26
To make an act of tragic violence:,26
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?,26
If you will live lament; if die be brief,26
Or like obedient subjects follow him,26
Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow,26
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,26
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance,26
And I for comfort have but one false glass,26
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,26
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,26
Edward and Clarence. O what cause have I,26
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!,26
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?,26
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!,26
I am not barren to bring forth complaints,26
That I being govern'd by the watery moon,26
Oh for my husband for my dear lord Edward!,26
Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence!,26
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.,26
Was never widow had so dear a loss!,26
Was never mother had so dear a loss!,26
Their woes are parcell'd mine are general.,26
I for a Clarence weep so doth not she:,26
I for an Edward weep so do not they:,26
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,26
Comfort dear mother: God is much displeased,26
In common worldly things 'tis call'd ungrateful,26
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;,26
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.,26
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him,26
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,26
Enter GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM DERBY HASTINGS and RATCLIFF,26
To wail the dimming of our shining star;,26
Madam my mother I do cry you mercy;,26
I crave your blessing.,26
Love charity obedience and true duty!,26
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:,26
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,26
Now cheer each other in each other's love,26
We are to reap the harvest of his son.,26
But lately splinter'd knit and join'd together,26
Me seemeth good that with some little train,26
Hither to London to be crown'd our king.,26
Marry my lord lest by a multitude,26
Which would be so much the more dangerous,26
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,26
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,26
I hope the king made peace with all of us,26
And so in me; and so I think in all:,26
To no apparent likelihood of breach,26
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,26
And so say I.,26
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.,26
To give your censures in this weighty business?,26
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER,26
For God's sake let not us two be behind;,26
As index to the story we late talk'd of,26
My other self my counsel's consistory,26
I like a child will go by thy direction.,26
Exeunt,26
Enter two Citizens meeting,26
I promise you I scarcely know myself:,26
Ay that the king is dead.,26
I fear I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.,26
Neighbours God speed!,26
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?,26
Then masters look to see a troublous world.,26
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!,26
That in his nonage council under him,26
No doubt shall then and till then govern well.,26
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.,26
For then this land was famously enrich'd,26
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.,26
Better it were they all came by the father,26
For emulation now who shall be nearest,26
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!,26
And were they to be ruled and not to rule,26
Come come we fear the worst; all shall be well.,26
When great leaves fall the winter is at hand;,26
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.,26
Tis more than we deserve or I expect.,26
Ye cannot reason almost with a man,26
Before the times of change still is it so:,26
Ensuing dangers; as by proof we see,26
But leave it all to God. whither away?,26
And so was I: I'll bear you company.,26
SCENE IV. London. The palace.,26
Last night I hear they lay at Northampton;,26
To-morrow or next day they will be here.,26
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.,26
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.,26
Why my young cousin it is good to grow.,26
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow,26
Gloucester,26
And since methinks I would not grow so fast,26
Good faith good faith the saying did not hold,26
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,26
That if this rule were true he should be gracious.,26
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.,26
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,26
How my pretty York? I pray thee let me hear it.,26
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old,26
Grandam this would have been a biting jest.,26
Grandam his nurse.,26
If 'twere not she I cannot tell who told me.,26
Good madam be not angry with the child.,26
Enter a Messenger,26
Such news my lord as grieves me to unfold.,26
Well madam and in health.,26
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,26
Who hath committed them?,26
Gloucester and Buckingham.,26
The sum of all I can I have disclosed;,26
Is all unknown to me my gracious lady.,26
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;,26
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:,26
I see as in a map the end of all.,26
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!,26
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,26
And being seated and domestic broils,26
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,26
And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen;,26
Come come my boy; we will to sanctuary.,26
I'll go along with you.,26
My gracious lady go;,26
For my part I'll resign unto your grace,26
As well I tender you and all of yours!,26
Exeunt,26
SCENE I. London. A street.,26
Welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber.,26
The weary way hath made you melancholy.,26
Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy,26
Sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years,26
Nor more can you distinguish of a man,26
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.,26
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,26
God keep you from them and from such false friends!,26
My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you.,26
God bless your grace with health and happy days!,26
I thought my mother and my brother York,26
Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not,26
Enter HASTINGS,26
Welcome my lord: what will our mother come?,26
The queen your mother and your brother York,26
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,26
Fie what an indirect and peevish course,26
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York,26
If she deny Lord Hastings go with him,26
My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory,26
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate,26
We should infringe the holy privilege,26
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.,26
Too ceremonious and traditional,26
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.,26
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,26
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;,26
Then taking him from thence that is not there,26
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;,26
My lord you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.,26
I go my lord.,26
Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS,26
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?,26
If I may counsel you some day or two,26
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit,26
I do not like the Tower of any place.,26
He did my gracious lord begin that place;,26
Is it upon record or else reported,26
Upon record my gracious lord.,26
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,26
Even to the general all-ending day.,26
live long.,26
I say without characters fame lives long.,26
Thus like the formal vice Iniquity,26
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;,26
His wit set down to make his valour live,26
For now he lives in fame though not in life.,26
What my gracious lord?,26
I'll win our ancient right in France again,26
[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.,26
Now in good time here comes the Duke of York.,26
Well my dread lord; so must I call you now.,26
Too late he died that might have kept that title,26
How fares our cousin noble Lord of York?,26
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth,26
He hath my lord.,26
O my fair cousin I must not say so.,26
He may command me as my sovereign;,26
I pray you uncle give me this dagger.,26
A beggar brother?,26
And being but a toy which is no grief to give.,26
A greater gift! O that's the sword to it.,26
O then I see you will part but with light gifts;,26
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.,26
What would you have my weapon little lord?,26
How?,26
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:,26
You mean to bear me not to bear with me:,26
Because that I am little like an ape,26
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!,26
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:,26
My lord will't please you pass along?,26
Will to your mother to entreat of her,26
What will you go unto the Tower my lord?,26
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.,26
Marry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:,26
I fear no uncles dead.,26
An if they live I hope I need not fear.,26
Thinking on them go I unto the Tower.,26
Think you my lord this little prating York,26
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?,26
Bold quick ingenious forward capable,26
Well let them rest. Come hither Catesby.,26
As closely to conceal what we impart:,26
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter,26
For the instalment of this noble duke,26
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,26
What think'st thou then of Stanley? what will he?,26
Well then no more but this: go gentle Catesby,26
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;,26
To sit about the coronation.,26
Encourage him and show him all our reasons:,26
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,26
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,26
Commend me to Lord William: tell him Catesby,26
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;,26
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.,26
My good lords both with all the heed I may.,26
You shall my lord.,26
Exit CATESBY,26
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?,26
And look when I am king claim thou of me,26
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.,26
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.,26
We may digest our complots in some form.,26
SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.,26
What ho! my lord!,26
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.,26
What is't o'clock?,26
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?,26
First he commends him to your noble lordship.,26
And then he sends you word,26
Besides he says there are two councils held;,26
which may make you and him to rue at the other.,26
If presently you will take horse with him,26
To shun the danger that his soul divines.,26
Bid him not fear the separated councils,26
And at the other is my servant Catesby,26
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.,26
And for his dreams I wonder he is so fond,26
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,26
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.,26
And we will both together to the Tower,26
My gracious lord I'll tell him what you say.,26
Enter CATESBY,26
Good morrow Catesby; you are early stirring,26
It is a reeling world indeed my lord;,26
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.,26
Ay my good lord.,26
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.,26
Ay on my life; and hopes to find forward,26
And thereupon he sends you this good news,26
The kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret.,26
Because they have been still mine enemies:,26
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,26
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!,26
That they who brought me in my master's hate,26
I tell thee Catesby--,26
Ere a fortnight make me elder,26
Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord,26
O monstrous monstrous! and so falls it out,26
With some men else who think themselves as safe,26
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.,26
Aside,26
I know they do; and I have well deserved it.,26
Come on come on; where is your boar-spear man?,26
My lord good morrow; good morrow Catesby:,26
I do not like these several councils I.,26
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;,26
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:,26
I would be so triumphant as I am?,26
Were jocund and supposed their state was sure,26
But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.,26
Pray God I say I prove a needless coward!,26
Come come have with you. Wot you what my lord?,26
They for their truth might better wear their heads,26
But come my lord let us away.,26
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.,26
How now sirrah! how goes the world with thee?,26
I tell thee man 'tis better with me now,26
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,26
But now I tell thee--keep it to thyself--,26
And I in better state than e'er I was.,26
Gramercy fellow: there drink that for me.,26
God save your lordship!,26
Enter a Priest,26
I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart.,26
Come the next Sabbath and I will content you.,26
Enter BUCKINGHAM,26
Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest;,26
Good faith and when I met this holy man,26
What go you toward the Tower?,26
I shall return before your lordship thence.,26
[Aside]  And supper too although thou know'st it not.,26
I'll wait upon your lordship.,26
SCENE III. Pomfret Castle.,26
Come bring forth the prisoners.,26
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die,26
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!,26
You live that shall cry woe for this after.,26
O Pomfret Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,26
Within the guilty closure of thy walls,26
And for more slander to thy dismal seat,26
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,26
Then cursed she Hastings then cursed she Buckingham,26
To hear her prayers for them as now for us,26
Be satisfied dear God with our true blood,26
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.,26
And take our leave until we meet in heaven.,26
SCENE IV. The Tower of London.,26
My lords at once: the cause why we are met,26
In God's name speak: when is the royal day?,26
It is and wants but nomination.,26
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?,26
Your grace we think should soonest know his mind.,26
But for our hearts he knows no more of mine,26
Nor I no more of his than you of mine.,26
I thank his grace I know he loves me well;,26
I have not sounded him nor he deliver'd,26
But you my noble lords may name the time;,26
Which I presume he'll take in gentle part.,26
Now in good time here comes the duke himself.,26
I have been long a sleeper; but I hope,26
Which by my presence might have been concluded.,26
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part--,26
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;,26
I thank your grace.,26
My lord?,26
I saw good strawberries in your garden there,26
Marry and will my lord with all my heart.,26
Cousin of Buckingham a word with you.,26
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,26
As he will lose his head ere give consent,26
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.,26
Exit GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM following,26
To-morrow in mine opinion is too sudden;,26
As else I would be were the day prolong'd.,26
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these,26
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;,26
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.,26
That can less hide his love or hate than he;,26
What of his heart perceive you in his face,26
Marry that with no man here he is offended;,26
I pray God he be not I say.,26
I pray you all tell me what they deserve,26
Of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd,26
The tender love I bear your grace my lord,26
To doom the offenders whatsoever they be,26
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:,26
Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up:,26
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,26
If they have done this thing my gracious lord--,26
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:,26
I will not dine until I see the same.,26
The rest that love me rise and follow me.,26
Woe woe for England! not a whit for me;,26
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;,26
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,26
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.,26
I now repent I told the pursuivant,26
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,26
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse,26
Dispatch my lord; the duke would be at dinner:,26
O momentary grace of mortal men,26
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,26
Ready with every nod to tumble down,26
Come come dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.,26
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee,26
Come lead me to the block; bear him my head.,26
Exeunt,26
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour marvellous ill-favoured,26
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,26
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?,26
Speak and look back and pry on every side,26
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks,26
And both are ready in their offices,26
But what is Catesby gone?,26
Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY,26
Look to the drawbridge there!,26
Catesby o'erlook the walls.,26
Look back defend thee here are enemies.,26
Be patient they are friends Ratcliff and Lovel.,26
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,26
So dear I loved the man that I must weep.,26
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;,26
The history of all her secret thoughts:,26
That his apparent open guilt omitted,26
He lived from all attainder of suspect.,26
That ever lived.,26
Were't not that by great preservation,26
This day had plotted in the council-house,26
What had he so?,26
Or that we would against the form of law,26
But that the extreme peril of the case,26
Enforced us to this execution?,26
And you my good lords both have well proceeded,26
I never look'd for better at his hands,26
Yet had not we determined he should die,26
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,26
Because my lord we would have had you heard,26
The manner and the purpose of his treason;,26
Unto the citizens who haply may,26
But my good lord your grace's word shall serve,26
And doubt you not right noble princes both,26
With all your just proceedings in this cause.,26
To avoid the carping censures of the world.,26
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:,26
Exit Lord Mayor,26
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:,26
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:,26
Only for saying he would make his son,26
Which by the sign thereof was termed so.,26
And bestial appetite in change of lust;,26
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,26
Nay for a need thus far come near my person:,26
Of that unsatiate Edward noble York,26
And by just computation of the time,26
Which well appeared in his lineaments,26
But touch this sparingly as 'twere far off,26
Fear not my lord I'll play the orator,26
Were for myself: and so my lord adieu.,26
Where you shall find me well accompanied,26
I go: and towards three or four o'clock,26
Exit BUCKINGHAM,26
To CATESBY,26
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.,26
Now will I in to take some privy order,26
And to give notice that no manner of person,26
Exit,26
Enter a Scrivener with a paper in his hand,26
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,26
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:,26
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;,26
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,26
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,26
Yet who's so blind but says he sees it not?,26
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.,26
SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.,26
How now my lord what say the citizens?,26
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.,26
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,26
The insatiate greediness of his desires,26
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,26
His resemblance being not like the duke;,26
Being the right idea of your father,26
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,26
Your bounty virtue fair humility:,26
Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse,26
I bid them that did love their country's good,26
Ah! and did they so?,26
But like dumb statues or breathing stones,26
Which when I saw I reprehended them;,26
His answer was the people were not wont,26
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,26
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.,26
At the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,26
And thus I took the vantage of those few,26
This general applause and loving shout,26
And even here brake off and came away.,26
No by my troth my lord.,26
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;,26
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,26
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:,26
Play the maid's part still answer nay and take it.,26
As I can say nay to thee for myself,26
Go go up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.,26
Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens,26
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.,26
Here comes his servant: how now Catesby,26
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;,26
He is within with two right reverend fathers,26
And no worldly suit would he be moved,26
Return good Catesby to thy lord again;,26
In deep designs and matters of great moment,26
Are come to have some conference with his grace.,26
Exit,26
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,26
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,26
Not sleeping to engross his idle body,26
Happy were England would this gracious prince,26
But sure I fear we shall ne'er win him to it.,26
I fear he will.,26
How now Catesby what says your lord?,26
He wonders to what end you have assembled,26
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:,26
Sorry I am my noble cousin should,26
By heaven I come in perfect love to him;,26
Exit CATESBY,26
Are at their beads 'tis hard to draw them thence,26
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft between two Bishops. CATESBY returns,26
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,26
And see a book of prayer in his hand,26
Famous Plantagenet most gracious prince,26
And pardon us the interruption,26
My lord there needs no such apology:,26
Who earnest in the service of my God,26
But leaving this what is your grace's pleasure?,26
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.,26
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,26
You have my lord: would it might please your grace,26
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?,26
The supreme seat the throne majestical,26
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,26
To the corruption of a blemished stock:,26
Which here we waken to our country's good,26
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,26
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf,26
Which to recure we heartily solicit,26
And kingly government of this your land,26
Or lowly factor for another's gain;,26
Your right of birth your empery your own.,26
Your very worshipful and loving friends,26
In this just suit come I to move your grace.,26
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.,26
If not to answer you might haply think,26
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,26
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,26
Then on the other side I cheque'd my friends.,26
And then in speaking not to incur the last,26
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert,26
First if all obstacles were cut away,26
As my ripe revenue and due by birth,26
So mighty and so many my defects,26
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,26
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.,26
And much I need to help you if need were;,26
Which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,26
And make no doubt us happy by his reign.,26
The right and fortune of his happy stars;,26
My lord this argues conscience in your grace;,26
All circumstances well considered.,26
So say we too but not by Edward's wife;,26
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--,26
To Bona sister to the King of France.,26
A care-crazed mother of a many children,26
Even in the afternoon of her best days,26
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts,26
By her in his unlawful bed he got,26
More bitterly could I expostulate,26
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.,26
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;,26
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry,26
Unto a lineal true-derived course.,26
Refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love.,26
Alas why would you heap these cares on me?,26
I do beseech you take it not amiss;,26
If you refuse it--as in love and zeal,26
As well we know your tenderness of heart,26
Which we have noted in you to your kin,26
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,26
But we will plant some other in the throne,26
And in this resolution here we leave you.--,26
O do not swear my lord of Buckingham.,26
Call them again my lord and accept their suit.,26
Would you enforce me to a world of care?,26
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,26
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest,26
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,26
I must have patience to endure the load:,26
Attend the sequel of your imposition,26
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;,26
How far I am from the desire thereof.,26
In saying so you shall but say the truth.,26
Long live Richard England's royal king!,26
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?,26
To-morrow then we will attend your grace:,26
Come let us to our holy task again.,26
Exeunt,26
SCENE I. Before the Tower.,26
Who m eets us here?  my niece Plantagenet,26
Now for my life she's wandering to the Tower,26
Daughter well met.,26
A happy and a joyful time of day!,26
No farther than the Tower; and as I guess,26
To gratulate the gentle princes there.,26
Enter BRAKENBURY,26
Master lieutenant pray you by your leave,26
Right well dear madam. By your patience,26
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.,26
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.,26
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?,26
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.,26
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,26
No madam no; I may not leave it so:,26
Exit,26
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence,26
And reverend looker on of two fair queens.,26
Come madam you must straight to Westminster,26
O cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart,26
With this dead-killing news!,26
Be of good cheer: mother how fares your grace?,26
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;,26
If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas,26
Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter-house,26
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,26
Full of wise care is this your counsel madam.,26
You shall have letters from me to my son,26
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.,26
O my accursed womb the bed of death!,26
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.,26
And I in all unwillingness will go.,26
Of golden metal that must round my brow,26
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,26
Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory,26
No! why?  When he that is my husband now,26
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands,26
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;,26
This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I ' accursed,26
And when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed;,26
As miserable by the life of thee,26
Lo ere I can repeat this curse again,26
Grossly grew captive to his honey words,26
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;,26
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,26
Besides he hates me for my father Warwick;,26
Poor heart adieu! I pity thy complaining.,26
Farewell thou woful welcomer of glory!,26
[To DORSET],26
To LADY ANNE,26
To QUEEN ELIZABETH,26
I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me!,26
And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.,26
Pity you ancient stones those tender babes,26
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!,26
For tender princes use my babies well!,26
Exeunt,26
Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III in pomp crowned; BUCKINGHAM CATESBY a page and others,26
My gracious sovereign?,26
Here he ascendeth his throne,26
And thy assistance is King Richard seated;,26
Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?,26
O Buckingham now do I play the touch,26
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.,26
Why Buckingham I say I would be king,26
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.,26
O bitter consequence,26
Cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull:,26
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.,26
Your grace may do your pleasure.,26
Say have I thy consent that they shall die?,26
Before I positively herein:,26
Exit,26
The king is angry: see he bites the lip.,26
And unrespective boys: none are for me,26
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.,26
My lord?,26
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?,26
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:,26
And will no doubt tempt him to any thing.,26
His name my lord is Tyrrel.,26
Exit Page,26
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:,26
And stops he now for breath?,26
How now! what news with you?,26
To Richmond in those parts beyond the sea,26
Stands apart,26
My lord?,26
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:,26
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,26
The boy is foolish and I fear not him.,26
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:,26
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.,26
I must be married to my brother's daughter,26
Murder her brothers and then marry her!,26
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:,26
Re-enter Page with TYRREL,26
James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject.,26
Prove me my gracious sovereign.,26
Ay my lord;,26
Why there thou hast it: two deep enemies,26
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:,26
Let me have open means to come to them,26
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark come hither Tyrrel,26
Whispers,26
And I will love thee and prefer thee too.,26
Shall we hear from thee Tyrrel ere we sleep?,26
Exit,26
My Lord I have consider'd in my mind,26
Well let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.,26
Stanley he is your wife's son well look to it.,26
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;,26
The which you promised I should possess.,26
Letters to Richmond you shall answer it.,26
As I remember Henry the Sixth,26
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.,26
My lord!,26
Have told me I being by that I should kill him?,26
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,26
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,26
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.,26
Ay what's o'clock?,26
Of what you promised me.,26
Upon the stroke of ten.,26
Why let it strike?,26
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.,26
Why then resolve me whether you will or no.,26
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.,26
Is it even so? rewards he my true service,26
O let me think on Hastings and be gone,26
Exit,26
Enter TYRREL,26
The most arch of piteous massacre,26
Dighton and Forrest whom I did suborn,26
Although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs,26
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.,26
Thus thus' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another,26
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,26
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;,26
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd,26
The most replenished sweet work of nature,26
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;,26
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.,26
Enter KING RICHARD III,26
Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news?,26
Beget your happiness be happy then,26
But didst thou see them dead?,26
And buried gentle Tyrrel?,26
But how or in what place I do not know.,26
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.,26
And be inheritor of thy desire.,26
Exit TYRREL,26
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;,26
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.,26
At young Elizabeth my brother's daughter,26
To her I go a jolly thriving wooer.,26
My lord!,26
Bad news my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;,26
Is in the field and still his power increaseth.,26
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.,26
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;,26
Then fiery expedition be my wing,26
Come muster men: my counsel is my shield;,26
Exeunt,26
Enter QUEEN MARGARET,26
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.,26
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.,26
And will to France hoping the consequence,26
Withdraw thee wretched Margaret: who comes here?,26
Ah my young princes! ah my tender babes!,26
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air,26
Hover about me with your airy wings,26
Hover about her; say that right for right,26
So many miseries have crazed my voice,26
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead?,26
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.,26
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?,26
When holy Harry died and my sweet son.,26
Woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd,26
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,26
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!,26
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!,26
O who hath any cause to mourn but I?,26
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,26
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.,26
Sitting down with them,26
I had an Edward till a Richard kill'd him;,26
Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard kill'd him;,26
I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him;,26
Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard kill'd him.,26
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:,26
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,26
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,26
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.,26
How do I thank thee that this carnal cur,26
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!,26
God witness with me I have wept for thine.,26
And now I cloy me with beholding it.,26
Thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward;,26
Match not the high perfection of my loss:,26
And the beholders of this tragic play,26
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.,26
Only reserved their factor to buy souls,26
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:,26
To have him suddenly convey'd away.,26
That I may live to say The dog is dead!,26
That I should wish for thee to help me curse,26
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;,26
The presentation of but what I was;,26
One heaved a-high to be hurl'd down below;,26
A dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble,26
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,26
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?,26
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?,26
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?,26
For happy wife a most distressed widow;,26
For queen a very caitiff crown'd with care;,26
For one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me;,26
For one commanding all obey'd of none.,26
And left thee but a very prey to time;,26
To torture thee the more being what thou art.,26
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?,26
From which even here I slip my weary neck,26
Farewell York's wife and queen of sad mischance:,26
O thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile,26
Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days;,26
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,26
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:,26
My words are dull; O quicken them with thine!,26
Exit,26
Windy attorneys to their client woes,26
Poor breathing orators of miseries!,26
Help not all yet do they ease the heart.,26
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother,26
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.,26
Who intercepts my expedition?,26
By strangling thee in her accursed womb,26
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,26
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,26
Tell me thou villain slave where are my children?,26
And little Ned Plantagenet his son?,26
A flourish trumpets! strike alarum drums!,26
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike I say!,26
Either be patient and entreat me fair,26
Thus will I drown your exclamations.,26
Ay I thank God my father and yourself.,26
Madam I have a touch of your condition,26
O let me speak!,26
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.,26
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,26
And came I not at last to comfort you?,26
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.,26
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;,26
Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous,26
treacherous,26
What comfortable hour canst thou name,26
Faith none but Humphrey Hour that call'd,26
To breakfast once forth of my company.,26
Let me march on and not offend your grace.,26
I prithee hear me speak.,26
Hear me a word;,26
So.,26
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,26
And never look upon thy face again.,26
Which in the day of battle tire thee more,26
My prayers on the adverse party fight;,26
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies,26
Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end;,26
Exit,26
Abides in me; I say amen to all.,26
I have no more sons of the royal blood,26
They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens;,26
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,26
And must she die for this? O let her live,26
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;,26
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,26
Wrong not her birth she is of royal blood.,26
Her life is only safest in her birth.,26
Lo at their births good stars were opposite.,26
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.,26
My babes were destined to a fairer death,26
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.,26
Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life.,26
Thy head all indirectly gave direction:,26
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,26
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,26
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;,26
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,26
Madam so thrive I in my enterprise,26
As I intend more good to you and yours,26
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,26
The advancement of your children gentle lady.,26
No to the dignity and height of honour,26
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;,26
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?,26
Will I withal endow a child of thine;,26
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs,26
Be brief lest that be process of thy kindness,26
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.,26
What do you think?,26
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;,26
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:,26
And mean to make her queen of England.,26
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?,26
I even I: what think you of it madam?,26
That would I learn of you,26
And wilt thou learn of me?,26
Send to her by the man that slew her brothers,26
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:,26
Did to thy father steep'd in Rutland's blood--,26
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,26
If this inducement force her not to love,26
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,26
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.,26
To win our daughter.,26
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,26
Say that I did all this for love of her.,26
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.,26
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,26
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,26
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,26
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter,26
Than is the doting title of a mother;,26
Even of your mettle of your very blood;,26
Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow.,26
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.,26
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.,26
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.,26
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,26
To high promotions and great dignity:,26
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;,26
And all the ruins of distressful times,26
What! we have many goodly days to see:,26
Shall come again transform'd to orient pearl,26
Of ten times double gain of happiness.,26
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;,26
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame,26
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys,26
The petty rebel dull-brain'd Buckingham,26
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;,26
And she shall be sole victress Caesar's Caesar.,26
Would be her lord? or shall I say her uncle?,26
Under what title shall I woo for thee,26
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?,26
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.,26
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.,26
To wail the tide as her mother doth.,26
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?,26
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?,26
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.,26
But she your subject loathes such sovereignty.,26
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.,26
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.,26
O no my reasons are too deep and dead;,26
Harp not on that string madam; that is past.,26
Now by my George my garter and my crown--,26
I swear--,26
The George profaned hath lost his holy honour;,26
The crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory.,26
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.,26
Tis full of thy foul wrongs.,26
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.,26
Thyself thyself misusest.,26
God's wrong is most of all.,26
The unity the king thy brother made,26
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,26
Had graced the tender temples of my child,26
Which now two tender playfellows to dust,26
What canst thou swear by now?,26
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;,26
Hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee.,26
slaughter'd,26
The parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd,26
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast,26
As I intend to prosper and repent,26
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!,26
Day yield me not thy light; nor night thy rest!,26
To my proceedings if with pure heart's love,26
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!,26
Without her follows to this land and me,26
Death desolation ruin and decay:,26
It will not be avoided but by this.,26
Be the attorney of my love to her:,26
Not my deserts but what I will deserve:,26
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.,26
Ay if the devil tempt thee to do good.,26
Ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.,26
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:,26
Selves of themselves to your recomforture.,26
And be a happy mother by the deed.,26
And you shall understand from me her mind.,26
Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH,26
Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following,26
My gracious sovereign on the western coast,26
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,26
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;,26
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.,26
Ratcliff thyself or Catesby; where is he?,26
Fly to the duke:,26
Post thou to Salisbury,26
To CATESBY,26
Why stand'st thou still and go'st not to the duke?,26
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.,26
The greatest strength and power he can make,26
I go.,26
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at,26
Why what wouldst thou do there before I go?,26
My mind is changed sir my mind is changed.,26
How now what news with you?,26
Nor none so bad but it may well be told.,26
Why dost thou run so many mile about,26
Once more what news?,26
There let him sink and be the seas on him!,26
I know not mighty sovereign but by guess.,26
Stirr'd up by Dorset Buckingham and Ely,26
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?,26
What heir of York is there alive but we?,26
Then tell me what doth he upon the sea?,26
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,26
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear.,26
Where is thy power then to beat him back?,26
Are they not now upon the western shore.,26
No my good lord my friends are in the north.,26
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?,26
Please it your majesty to give me leave,26
Where and what time your majesty shall please.,26
I will not trust you sir.,26
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:,26
Well,26
Your son George Stanley: look your faith be firm.,26
So deal with him as I prove true to you.,26
Enter a Messenger,26
As I by friends am well advertised,26
Bishop of Exeter his brother there,26
Enter another Messenger,26
And every hour more competitors,26
Enter another Messenger,26
Out on you owls! nothing but songs of death?,26
Take that until thou bring me better news.,26
Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters,26
And he himself wander'd away alone,26
I cry thee mercy:,26
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd,26
Such proclamation hath been made my liege.,26
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,26
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,26
Richmond in Yorkshire sent out a boat,26
If they were his assistants yea or no;,26
Upon his party: he mistrusting them,26
March on march on since we are up in arms;,26
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.,26
My liege the Duke of Buckingham is taken;,26
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,26
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,26
Some one take order Buckingham be brought,26
Flourish. Exeunt,26
Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK,26
That in the sty of this most bloody boar,26
If I revolt off goes young George's head;,26
But tell me where is princely Richmond now?,26
What men of name resort to him?,26
Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley;,26
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;,26
And towards London they do bend their course,26
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:,26
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.,26
Exeunt,26
SCENE I. Salisbury. An open place.,26
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?,26
Hastings and Edward's children Rivers Grey,26
Vaughan and all that have miscarried,26
If that your moody discontented souls,26
Even for revenge mock my destruction!,26
It is my lord.,26
This is the day that in King Edward's time,26
False to his children or his wife's allies,26
By the false faith of him I trusted most;,26
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:,26
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head,26
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men,26
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;,26
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.',26
Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame.,26
SCENE II. The camp near Tamworth.,26
Fellows in arms and my most loving friends,26
Thus far into the bowels of the land,26
And here receive we from our father Stanley,26
The wretched bloody and usurping boar,26
Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough,26
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,26
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.,26
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace,26
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,26
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.,26
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.,26
True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings:,26
Exeunt,26
Enter KING RICHARD III in arms with NORFOLK SURREY and others,26
My Lord of Surrey why look you so sad?,26
My Lord of Norfolk--,26
Norfolk we must have knocks; ha! must we not?,26
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;,26
Who hath descried the number of the foe?,26
Why our battalion trebles that account:,26
Which they upon the adverse party want.,26
Let us survey the vantage of the field,26
Let's want no discipline make no delay,26
Exeunt,26
The weary sun hath made a golden set,26
Gives signal of a goodly day to-morrow.,26
Give me some ink and paper in my tent,26
Limit each leader to his several charge,26
My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon,26
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:,26
And by the second hour in the morning,26
Yet one thing more good Blunt before thou go'st,26
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,26
His regiment lies half a mile at least,26
If without peril it be possible,26
And give him from me this most needful scroll.,26
And so God give you quiet rest to-night!,26
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business,26
They withdraw into the tent,26
What is't o'clock?,26
It's nine o'clock.,26
Give me some ink and paper.,26
And all my armour laid into my tent?,26
Good Norfolk hie thee to thy charge;,26
I go my lord.,26
I warrant you my lord.,26
Catesby!,26
Send out a pursuivant at arms,26
Before sunrising lest his son George fall,26
Exit CATESBY,26
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.,26
Ratcliff!,26
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?,26
Much about cock-shut time from troop to troop,26
So I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:,26
Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.,26
It is my lord.,26
Ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent,26
Exeunt RATCLIFF and the other Attendants,26
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!,26
Be to thy person noble father-in-law!,26
I by attorney bless thee from thy mother,26
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,26
In brief--for so the season bids us be--,26
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement,26
I as I may--that which I would I cannot--,26
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:,26
Lest being seen thy brother tender George,26
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time,26
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,26
God give us leisure for these rites of love!,26
Good lords conduct him to his regiment:,26
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,26
Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen.,26
O Thou whose captain I account myself,26
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,26
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!,26
That we may praise thee in the victory!,26
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:,26
Sleeps,26
Ghost,26
Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!,26
At Tewksbury: despair therefore and die!,26
Be cheerful Richmond; for the wronged souls,26
King Henry's issue Richmond comforts thee.,26
Ghost,26
When I was mortal my anointed body,26
Think on the Tower and me: despair and die!,26
To RICHMOND,26
Harry that prophesied thou shouldst be king,26
Enter the Ghost of CLARENCE,26
Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!,26
Poor Clarence by thy guile betrayed to death!,26
And fall thy edgeless sword: despair and die!--,26
Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,26
Good angels guard thy battle! live and flourish!,26
[To KING RICHARD III],26
Rivers. that died at Pomfret! despair and die!,26
Think upon Grey and let thy soul despair!,26
Think upon Vaughan and with guilty fear,26
[To RICHMOND],26
Will conquer him! awake and win the day!,26
[To KING RICHARD III],26
And in a bloody battle end thy days!,26
To RICHMOND,26
Arm fight and conquer for fair England's sake!,26
Ghosts,26
Dream on thy cousins smother'd in the Tower:,26
And weigh thee down to ruin shame and death!,26
To RICHMOND,26
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!,26
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.,26
[To KING RICHARD III],26
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,26
To-morrow in the battle think on me,26
To RICHMOND,26
Dream of success and happy victory!,26
Enter the Ghost of BUCKINGHAM,26
[To KING RICHARD III],26
The last was I that felt thy tyranny:,26
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!,26
Fainting despair; despairing yield thy breath!,26
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:,26
God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;,26
The Ghosts vanish,26
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.,26
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me!,26
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.,26
Richard loves Richard; that is I am I.,26
Then fly. What from myself?   Great reason why:,26
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good,26
O no! alas I rather hate myself,26
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.,26
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,26
And every tale condemns me for a villain.,26
Murder stem murder in the direst degree;,26
Throng to the bar crying all Guilty! guilty!,26
And if I die no soul shall pity me:,26
Find in myself no pity to myself?,26
Came to my tent; and every one did threat,26
Enter RATCLIFF,26
Zounds! who is there?,26
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;,26
O Ratcliff I have dream'd a fearful dream!,26
No doubt my lord.,26
Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows.,26
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard,26
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.,26
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,26
Exeunt,26
Good morrow Richmond!,26
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.,26
The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams,26
Have I since your departure had my lords.,26
Came to my tent and cried on victory:,26
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.,26
Upon the stroke of four.,26
His oration to his soldiers,26
The leisure and enforcement of the time,26
God and our good cause fight upon our side;,26
Like high-rear'd bulwarks stand before our faces;,26
Had rather have us win than him they follow:,26
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;,26
One that made means to come by what he hath,26
Abase foul stone made precious by the foil,26
One that hath ever been God's enemy:,26
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;,26
You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain;,26
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;,26
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;,26
Your children's children quit it in your age.,26
Advance your standards draw your willing swords.,26
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;,26
The least of you shall share his part thereof.,26
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!,26
Re-enter KING RICHARD RATCLIFF Attendants and Forces,26
That he was never trained up in arms.,26
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.',26
Clock striketh,26
Who saw the sun to-day?,26
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book,26
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!,26
The sun will not be seen to-day;,26
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.,26
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven,26
Enter NORFOLK,26
Come bustle bustle; caparison my horse.,26
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,26
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,26
Our archers shall be placed in the midst,26
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.,26
In the main battle whose puissance on either side,26
This and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou Norfolk?,26
This found I on my tent this morning.,26
[Reads],26
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.',26
Go gentleman every man unto his charge,26
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,26
Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law.,26
If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell.,26
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?,26
A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways,26
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth,26
You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest;,26
They would restrain the one distain the other.,26
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?,26
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?,26
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,26
Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit,26
If we be conquer'd let men conquer us,26
Have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd,26
Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?,26
Drum afar off,26
Fight gentlemen of England! fight bold yoemen!,26
Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood;,26
Enter a Messenger,26
My lord he doth deny to come.,26
My lord the enemy is past the marsh,26
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:,26
Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George,26
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.,26
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,26
Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue!,26
Daring an opposite to every danger:,26
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.,26
Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III,26
Withdraw my lord; I'll help you to a horse.,26
And I will stand the hazard of the die:,26
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.,26
Exeunt,26
Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND; they  fight. KING RICHARD III is slain. Retreat and  flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND DERBY bearing the crown with divers other Lords,26
The day is ours the bloody dog is dead.,26
Lo here this long-usurped royalty,26
Have I pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal:,26
Great God of heaven say Amen to all!,26
He is my lord and safe in Leicester town;,26
What men of name are slain on either side?,26
Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon.,26
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled,26
And then as we have ta'en the sacrament,26
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,26
What traitor hears me and says not amen?,26
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,26
The son compell'd been butcher to the sire:,26
Divided in their dire division,26
The true succeeders of each royal house,26
And let their heirs God if thy will be so.,26
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!,26
That would reduce these bloody days again,26
Let them not live to taste this land's increase,26
Now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again:,26
Exeunt,26
PROLOGUE,27
In fair Verona where we lay our scene,27
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.,27
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;,27
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.,27
And the continuance of their parents' rage,27
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;,27
What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend.,27
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY of the house of Capulet armed with swords and bucklers,27
No for then we should be colliers.,27
Ay while you live draw your neck out o' the collar.,27
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.,27
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:,27
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will,27
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes,27
True; and therefore women being the weaker vessels,27
Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids,27
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.,27
have fought with the men I will be cruel with the,27
The heads of the maids?,27
take it in what sense thou wilt.,27
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and,27
Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst thou,27
two of the house of the Montagues.,27
How! turn thy back and run?,27
No marry; I fear thee!,27
I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as,27
Nay as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;,27
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR,27
I do bite my thumb sir.,27
[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side if I say,27
No.,27
bite my thumb sir.,27
Quarrel sir! no sir.,27
No better.,27
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.,27
You lie.,27
They fight,27
Part fools!,27
Beats down their swords,27
What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?,27
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,27
What drawn and talk of peace! I hate the word,27
Have at thee coward!,27
Enter several of both houses who join the fray; then enter Citizens with clubs,27
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!,27
What noise is this? Give me my long sword ho!,27
My sword I say! Old Montague is come,27
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE,27
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.,27
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace,27
Will they not hear? What ho! you men you beasts,27
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,27
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,27
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word,27
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,27
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,27
Canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate:,27
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.,27
You Capulet; shall go along with me:,27
To know our further pleasure in this case,27
Once more on pain of death all men depart.,27
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?,27
Here were the servants of your adversary,27
I drew to part them: in the instant came,27
Which as he breathed defiance to my ears,27
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:,27
Came more and more and fought on part and part,27
O where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?,27
Madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun,27
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;,27
That westward rooteth from the city's side,27
Towards him I made but he was ware of me,27
I measuring his affections by my own,27
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,27
Many a morning hath he there been seen,27
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;,27
Should in the furthest east begin to draw,27
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,27
Shuts up his windows locks far daylight out,27
Black and portentous must this humour prove,27
My noble uncle do you know the cause?,27
Have you importuned him by any means?,27
But he his own affections' counsellor,27
But to himself so secret and so close,27
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,27
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.,27
We would as willingly give cure as know.,27
See where he comes: so please you step aside;,27
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,27
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE,27
Is the day so young?,27
Ay me! sad hours seem long.,27
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?,27
In love?,27
Of love?,27
Alas that love so gentle in his view,27
Alas that love whose view is muffled still,27
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?,27
Here's much to do with hate but more with love.,27
O any thing of nothing first create!,27
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!,27
sick health!,27
This love feel I that feel no love in this.,27
No coz I rather weep.,27
At thy good heart's oppression.,27
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,27
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown,27
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;,27
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:,27
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.,27
Soft! I will go along;,27
Tut I have lost myself; I am not here;,27
Tell me in sadness who is that you love.,27
Groan! why no.,27
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:,27
In sadness cousin I do love a woman.,27
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.,27
Well in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit,27
And in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,27
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,27
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:,27
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.,27
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste,27
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.,27
To merit bliss by making me despair:,27
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.,27
O teach me how I should forget to think.,27
Examine other beauties.,27
To call hers exquisite in question more:,27
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;,27
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:,27
What doth her beauty serve but as a note,27
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter CAPULET PARIS and Servant,27
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard I think,27
Of honourable reckoning are you both;,27
But now my lord what say you to my suit?,27
My child is yet a stranger in the world;,27
Let two more summers wither in their pride,27
Younger than she are happy mothers made.,27
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,27
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart,27
An she agree within her scope of choice,27
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,27
Such as I love; and you among the store,27
At my poor house look to behold this night,27
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel,27
Of limping winter treads even such delight,27
Inherit at my house; hear all all see,27
Which on more view of many mine being one,27
Come go with me.,27
Go sirrah trudge about,27
Whose names are written there and to them say,27
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS,27
written that the shoemaker should meddle with his,27
his pencil and the painter with his nets; but I am,27
writ and can never find what names the writing,27
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO,27
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;,27
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:,27
And the rank poison of the old will die.,27
For what I pray thee?,27
Why Romeo art thou mad?,27
Shut up in prison kept without my food,27
God gi' god-den. I pray sir can you read?,27
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but I,27
Ay if I know the letters and the language.,27
Stay fellow; I can read.,27

Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the,27

Exit,27
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,27
Go thither; and with unattainted eye,27
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.,27
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires;,27
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars!,27
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.,27
Herself poised with herself in either eye:,27
Your lady's love against some other maid,27
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.,27
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.,27
SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.,27
Nurse where's my daughter? call her forth to me.,27
I bade her come. What lamb! what ladybird!,27
Enter JULIET,27

What is your will?,27
We must talk in secret:--nurse come back again;,27
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.,27
She's not fourteen.,27
And yet to my teeth be it spoken I have but four--,27
To Lammas-tide?,27
Even or odd of all days in the year,27
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--,27
She was too good for me: but as I said,27
That shall she marry; I remember it well.,27
And she was wean'd--I never shall forget it--,27
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,27
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--,27
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple,27
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!,27
To bid me trudge:,27
For then she could stand alone; nay by the rood,27
For even the day before she broke her brow:,27
A' was a merry man--took up the child:,27
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;,27
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.',27
I warrant an I should live a thousand years,27
And pretty fool it stinted and said 'Ay.',27
Yes madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,27
And yet I warrant it had upon its brow,27
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:,27
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;,27
And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I.,27
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:,27
I have my wish.,27
I came to talk of. Tell me daughter Juliet,27
It is an honour that I dream not of.,27
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.,27
Here in Verona ladies of esteem,27
I was your mother much upon these years,27
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.,27
As all the world--why he's a man of wax.,27
Nay he's a flower; in faith a very flower.,27
This night you shall behold him at our feast;,27
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;,27
And see how one another lends content,27
Find written in the margent of his eyes.,27
To beautify him only lacks a cover:,27
For fair without the fair within to hide:,27
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;,27
By having him making yourself no less.,27
Speak briefly can you like of Paris' love?,27
But no more deep will I endart mine eye,27
Enter a Servant,27
called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in,27
hence to wait; I beseech you follow straight.,27
Exit Servant,27
Go girl seek happy nights to happy days.,27
SCENE IV. A street.,27
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?,27
The date is out of such prolixity:,27
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,27
Nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke,27
But let them measure us by what they will;,27
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;,27
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance.,27
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead,27
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,27
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft,27
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:,27
And to sink in it should you burden love;,27
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,27
If love be rough with you be rough with love;,27
Give me a case to put my visage in:,27
What curious eye doth quote deformities?,27
Come knock and enter; and no sooner in,27
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart,27
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;,27
The game was ne'er so fair and I am done.,27
If thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire,27
Up to the ears. Come we burn daylight ho!,27
I mean sir in delay,27
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits,27
And we mean well in going to this mask;,27
Why may one ask?,27
And so did I.,27
That dreamers often lie.,27
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.,27
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone,27
Drawn with a team of little atomies,27
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,27
The traces of the smallest spider's web,27
Her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film,27
Not so big as a round little worm,27
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,27
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.,27
Through lovers' brains and then they dream of love;,27
O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees,27
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,27
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,27
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,27
Then dreams he of another benefice:,27
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,27
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon,27
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two,27
That plats the manes of horses in the night,27
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes:,27
That presses them and learns them first to bear,27
This is she--,27
Thou talk'st of nothing.,27
Which are the children of an idle brain,27
Which is as thin of substance as the air,27
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,27
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.,27
Supper is done and we shall come too late.,27
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,27
With this night's revels and expire the term,27
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.,27
Direct my sail! On lusty gentlemen.,27
Exeunt,27
Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins,27
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!,27
hands and they unwashed too 'tis a foul thing.,27
court-cupboard look to the plate. Good thou save,27
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.,27
Ay boy ready.,27
sought for in the great chamber.,27
brisk awhile and the longer liver take all.,27
Welcome gentlemen! ladies that have their toes,27
Ah ha my mistresses! which of you all,27
She I'll swear hath corns; am I come near ye now?,27
That I have worn a visor and could tell,27
Such as would please: 'tis gone 'tis gone 'tis gone:,27
A hall a hall! give room! and foot it girls.,27
More light you knaves; and turn the tables up,27
Ah sirrah this unlook'd-for sport comes well.,27
For you and I are past our dancing days:,27
Were in a mask?,27
What man! 'tis not so much 'tis not so much:,27
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,27
Tis more 'tis more his son is elder sir;,27
Will you tell me that?,27
[To a Servingman]  What lady is that which doth,27
Of yonder knight?,27
O she doth teach the torches to burn bright!,27
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;,27
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,27
The measure done I'll watch her place of stand,27
Did my heart love till now? forswear it sight!,27
This by his voice should be a Montague.,27
Come hither cover'd with an antic face,27
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,27
Why how now kinsman! wherefore storm you so?,27
A villain that is hither come in spite,27
Young Romeo is it?,27
Content thee gentle coz let him alone;,27
And to say truth Verona brags of him,27
I would not for the wealth of all the town,27
Therefore be patient take no note of him:,27
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,27
It fits when such a villain is a guest:,27
He shall be endured:,27
Am I the master here or you? go to.,27
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!,27
Why uncle 'tis a shame.,27
You are a saucy boy: is't so indeed?,27
You must contrary me! marry 'tis time.,27
Be quiet or--More light more light! For shame!,27
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting,27
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,27
Exit,27
This holy shrine the gentle fine is this:,27
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.,27
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;,27
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.,27
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer.,27
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair.,27
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.,27
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.,27
Give me my sin again.,27
Madam your mother craves a word with you.,27
Marry bachelor,27
And a good lady and a wise and virtuous,27
I tell you he that can lay hold of her,27
Is she a Capulet?,27
Away begone; the sport is at the best.,27
Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone;,27
Is it e'en so? why then I thank you all,27
More torches here! Come on then let's to bed.,27
I'll to my rest.,27
Come hither nurse. What is yond gentleman?,27
What's he that now is going out of door?,27
What's he that follows there that would not dance?,27
Go ask his name: if he be married.,27
His name is Romeo and a Montague;,27
My only love sprung from my only hate!,27
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,27
What's this? what's this?,27
Of one I danced withal.,27
Anon anon!,27
Exeunt,27
PROLOGUE,27
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,27
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,27
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,27
But to his foe supposed he must complain,27
Being held a foe he may not have access,27
And she as much in love her means much less,27
But passion lends them power time means to meet,27
Exit,27
Enter ROMEO,27
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out.,27
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO,27
He is wise;,27
He ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall:,27
Nay I'll conjure too.,27
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:,27
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;',27
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,27
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!,27
The ape is dead and I must conjure him.,27
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,27
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,27
And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him.,27
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,27
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;,27
Is fair and honest and in his mistres s' name,27
Come he hath hid himself among these trees,27
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.,27
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,27
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.,27
An open et caetera thou a poperin pear!,27
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:,27
Go then; for 'tis in vain,27
Exeunt,27
Enter ROMEO,27
JULIET appears above at a window,27
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.,27
Who is already sick and pale with grief,27
Be not her maid since she is envious;,27
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.,27
O that she knew she were!,27
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.,27
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,27
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.,27
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,27
Would through the airy region stream so bright,27
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!,27
That I might touch that cheek!,27
She speaks:,27
As glorious to this night being o'er my head,27
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes,27
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds,27
O Romeo Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?,27
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love,27
[Aside]  Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this?,27
Thou art thyself though not a Montague.,27
Nor arm nor face nor any other part,27
What's in a name? that which we call a rose,27
So Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd,27
Without that title. Romeo doff thy name,27
Take all myself.,27
Call me but love and I'll be new baptized;,27
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night,27
By a name,27
My name dear saint is hateful to myself,27
Had I it written I would tear the word.,27
Of that tongue's utterance yet I know the sound:,27
Neither fair saint if either thee dislike.,27
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,27
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.,27
For stony limits cannot hold love out,27
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.,27
Alack there lies more peril in thine eye,27
And I am proof against their enmity.,27
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;,27
My life were better ended by their hate,27
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?,27
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.,27
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,27
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,27
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night,27
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!,27
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,27
Then say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,27
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,27
So thou wilt woo; but else not for the world.,27
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:,27
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.,27
But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware,27
And not impute this yielding to light love,27
Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear,27
O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon,27
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.,27
Do not swear at all;,27
Which is the god of my idolatry,27
If my heart's dear love--,27
I have no joy of this contract to-night:,27
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be,27
This bud of love by summer's ripening breath,27
Good night good night! as sweet repose and rest,27
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?,27
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.,27
And yet I would it were to give again.,27
But to be frank and give it thee again.,27
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,27
The more I have for both are infinite.,27
I hear some noise within; dear love adieu!,27
Stay but a little I will come again.,27
O blessed blessed night! I am afeard.,27
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.,27
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed.,27
Thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow,27
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;,27
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.,27
I come anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,27
[Within]  Madam!,27
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief:,27
So thrive my soul--,27
Exit above,27
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from,27
But love from love toward school with heavy looks.,27
Re-enter JULIET above,27
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!,27
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,27
With repetition of my Romeo's name.,27
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,27
Romeo!,27
At what o'clock to-morrow,27
At the hour of nine.,27
I have forgot why I did call thee back.,27
I shall forget to have thee still stand there,27
And I'll still stay to have thee still forget,27
Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:,27
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,27
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,27
I would I were thy bird.,27
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.,27
sweet sorrow,27
Exit above,27
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest!,27
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.,27
SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.,27
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,27
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels,27
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye,27
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours,27
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;,27
And from her womb children of divers kind,27
Many for many virtues excellent,27
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies,27
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live,27
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use,27
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied;,27
Within the infant rind of this small flower,27
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part;,27
Two such opposed kings encamp them still,27
And where the worser is predominant,27
Enter ROMEO,27
Benedicite!,27
Young son it argues a distemper'd head,27
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,27
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain,27
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure,27
Or if not so then here I hit it right,27
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.,27
With Rosaline my ghostly father? no;,27
That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?,27
I have been feasting with mine enemy,27
That's by me wounded: both our remedies,27
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo,27
Be plain good son and homely in thy drift;,27
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set,27
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine;,27
By holy marriage: when and where and how,27
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,27
Holy Saint Francis what a change is here!,27
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies,27
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine,27
How much salt water thrown away in waste,27
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,27
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit,27
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,27
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,27
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.,27
And bad'st me bury love.,27
To lay one in another out to have.,27
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;,27
O she knew well,27
But come young waverer come go with me,27
For this alliance may so happy prove,27
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO,27
Came he not home to-night?,27
Ah that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline.,27
Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet,27
A challenge on my life.,27
Any man that can write may answer a letter.,27
dares being dared.,27
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a,27
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to,27
Why what is Tybalt?,27
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as,27
proportion; rests me his minim rest one two and,27
button a duellist a duellist; a gentleman of the,27
ah the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the,27
The what?,27
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,27
whore!' Why is not this a lamentable thing,27
these strange flies these fashion-mongers these,27
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O their,27
Enter ROMEO,27
Without his roe like a dried herring: flesh flesh,27
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a,27
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;,27
eye or so but not to the purpose. Signior,27
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit,27
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?,27
Pardon good Mercutio my business was great; and in,27
That's as much as to say such a case as yours,27
Meaning to court'sy.,27
A most courteous exposition.,27
Pink for flower.,27
Why then is my pump well flowered.,27
worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it,27
O single-soled jest solely singular for the,27
Come between us good Benvolio; my wits faint.,27
Nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase I have,27
thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five:,27
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast,27
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.,27
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most,27
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?,27
inch narrow to an ell broad!,27
to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose.,27
now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo; now art,27
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,27
Stop there stop there.,27
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.,27
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and,27
Here's goodly gear!,27
A sail a sail!,27
Peter!,27
My fan Peter.,27
fairer face.,27
God ye good den fair gentlewoman.,27
Tis no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of the,27
Out upon you! what a man are you!,27
mar.,27
quoth a'? Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I,27
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when,27
I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse.,27
Yea is the worst well? very well took i' faith;,27
if you be he sir I desire some confidence with,27
She will indite him to some supper.,27
What hast thou found?,27
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.,27
An old hare hoar,27
Is very good meat in lent,27
Is too much for a score,27
Romeo will you come to your father's? we'll,27
I will follow you.,27
Singing,27
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO,27
merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?,27
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand,27
An a' speak any thing against me I'll take him,27
Jacks; and if I cannot I'll find those that shall.,27
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by,27
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had my weapon,27
draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a,27
Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about,27
and as I told you my young lady bade me inquire you,27
but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into,27
kind of behavior as they say: for the gentlewoman,27
with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered,27
Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress. I,27
Good heart and i' faith I will tell her as much:,27
What wilt thou tell her nurse? thou dost not mark me.,27
I take it is a gentlemanlike offer.,27
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;,27
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.,27
Go to; I say you shall.,27
And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall:,27
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;,27
Must be my convoy in the secret night.,27
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.,27
What say'st thou my dear nurse?,27
Two may keep counsel putting one away?,27
Well sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,27
is a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain,27
see a toad a very toad as see him. I anger her,27
man; but I'll warrant you when I say so she looks,27
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?,27
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for,27
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of,27
to hear it.,27
Ay a thousand times.,27
Peter!,27
Peter take my fan and go before and apace.,27
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.,27
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;,27
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.,27
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,27
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,27
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill,27
Is three long hours yet she is not come.,27
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;,27
And his to me:,27
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead.,27
Enter Nurse and PETER,27
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.,27
Exit PETER,27
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily;,27
By playing it to me with so sour a face.,27
Fie how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!,27
Nay come I pray thee speak; good good nurse speak.,27
Do you not see that I am out of breath?,27
To say to me that thou art out of breath?,27
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.,27
Say either and I'll stay the circumstance:,27
Well you have made a simple choice; you know not,27
face be better than any man's yet his leg excels,27
though they be not to be talked on yet they are,27
but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy,27
No no: but all this did I know before.,27
Lord how my head aches! what a head have I!,27
My back o' t' other side--O my back my back!,27
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!,27
Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love?,27
courteous and a kind and a handsome and I,27
Where is my mother! why she is within;,27
Your love says like an honest gentleman,27
O God's lady dear!,27
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?,27
Here's such a coil! come what says Romeo?,27
I have.,27
There stays a husband to make you a wife:,27
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.,27
To fetch a ladder by the which your love,27
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,27
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO,27
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!,27
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy,27
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,27
It is enough I may but call her mine.,27
And in their triumph die like fire and powder,27
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,27
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;,27
Enter JULIET,27
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:,27
That idles in the wanton summer air,27
Good even to my ghostly confessor.,27
As much to him else is his thanks too much.,27
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more,27
This neighbour air and let rich music's tongue,27
Receive in either by this dear encounter.,27
Brags of his substance not of ornament:,27
But my true love is grown to such excess,27
Come come with me and we will make short work;,27
Till holy church incorporate two in one.,27
ACT III,27
Enter MERCUTIO BENVOLIO Page and Servants,27
The day is hot the Capulets abroad,27
For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring.,27
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword,27
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws,27
Am I like such a fellow?,27
any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as,27
And what to?,27
shortly for one would kill the other. Thou! why,27
or a hair less in his beard than thou hast: thou,27
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what,27
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of,27
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a,27
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:,27
his new doublet before Easter? with another for,27
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!,27
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.,27
By my head here come the Capulets.,27
Enter TYBALT and others,27
Gentlemen good den: a word with one of you.,27
something; make it a word and a blow.,27
will give me occasion.,27
Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo--,27
thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but,27
make you dance. 'Zounds consort!,27
Either withdraw unto some private place,27
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.,27
I will not budge for no man's pleasure I.,27
Well peace be with you sir: here comes my man.,27
Marry go before to field he'll be your follower;,27
Romeo the hate I bear thee can afford,27
Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee,27
To such a greeting: villain am I none;,27
Boy this shall not excuse the injuries,27
I do protest I never injured thee,27
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:,27
As dearly as my own--be satisfied.,27
Alla stoccata carries it away.,27
Tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk?,27
Good king of cats nothing but one of your nine,27
shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the,27
by the ears? make haste lest mine be about your,27
I am for you.,27
Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up.,27
They fight,27
Gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage!,27
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:,27
TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO and flies with his followers,27
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.,27
What art thou hurt?,27
Where is my page? Go villain fetch a surgeon.,27
Courage man; the hurt cannot be much.,27
church-door; but 'tis enough'twill serve: ask for,27
am peppered I warrant for this world. A plague o',27
cat to scratch a man to death! a braggart a,27
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I,27
I thought all for the best.,27
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!,27
And soundly too: your houses!,27
This gentleman the prince's near ally,27
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd,27
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,27
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!,27
O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio's dead!,27
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.,27
This but begins the woe others must end.,27
Alive in triumph! and Mercutio slain!,27
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!,27
Now Tybalt take the villain back again,27
Is but a little way above our heads,27
Either thou or I or both must go with him.,27
Shalt with him hence.,27
They fight; TYBALT falls,27
The citizens are up and Tybalt slain.,27
If thou art taken: hence be gone away!,27
Why dost thou stay?,27
Enter Citizens  and c,27
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he?,27
Up sir go with me;,27
Enter Prince attended; MONTAGUE CAPULET their Wives and others,27
O noble prince I can discover all,27
There lies the man slain by young Romeo,27
Tybalt my cousin! O my brother's child!,27
O my dear kinsman! Prince as thou art true,27
O cousin cousin!,27
Tybalt here slain whom Romeo's hand did slay;,27
How nice the quarrel was and urged withal,27
With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd,27
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts,27
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point,27
Cold death aside and with the other sends,27
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,27
his tongue,27
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm,27
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled;,27
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,27
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.,27
This is the truth or let Benvolio die.,27
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:,27
And all those twenty could but kill one life.,27
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live.,27
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?,27
His fault concludes but what the law should end,27
And for that offence,27
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,27
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine,27
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;,27
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,27
Bear hence this body and attend our will:,27
Exeunt,27
Enter JULIET,27
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner,27
And bring in cloudy night immediately.,27
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo,27
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites,27
It best agrees with night. Come civil night,27
And learn me how to lose a winning match,27
Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks,27
Think true love acted simple modesty.,27
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,27
Come gentle night come loving black-brow'd night,27
Take him and cut him out in little stars,27
That all the world will be in love with night,27
O I have bought the mansion of a love,27
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day,27
To an impatient child that hath new robes,27
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks,27
Enter Nurse with cords,27
That Romeo bid thee fetch?,27
Throws them down,27
Ah well-a-day! he's dead he's dead he's dead!,27
Alack the day! he's gone he's kill'd he's dead!,27
Romeo can,27
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!,27
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.,27
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more,27
I am not I if there be such an I;,27
If he be slain say 'I'; or if not no:,27
I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes--,27
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse;,27
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.,27
To prison eyes ne'er look on liberty!,27
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!,27
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!,27
What storm is this that blows so contrary?,27
My dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord?,27
For who is living if those two are gone?,27
Romeo that kill'd him he is banished.,27
It did it did; alas the day it did!,27
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?,27
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!,27
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,27
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell,27
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?,27
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell,27
There's no trust,27
All forsworn all naught all dissemblers.,27
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old.,27
Blister'd be thy tongue,27
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;,27
Sole monarch of the universal earth.,27
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?,27
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name,27
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin?,27
Back foolish tears back to your native spring;,27
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.,27
And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband:,27
Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death,27
But O it presses to my memory,27
Tybalt is dead and Romeo--banished;',27
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death,27
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,27
Why follow'd not when she said 'Tybalt's dead',27
Which modern lamentations might have moved?,27
Romeo is banished' to speak that word,27
All slain all dead. 'Romeo is banished!',27
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.,27
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:,27
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,27
Take up those cords: poor ropes you are beguiled,27
He made you for a highway to my bed;,27
Come cords come nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;,27
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo,27
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night:,27
O find him! give this ring to my true knight,27
Exeunt,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE,27
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,27
Enter ROMEO,27
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,27
Too familiar,27
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.,27
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,27
Ha banishment! be merciful say 'death;',27
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.',27
Be patient for the world is broad and wide.,27
But purgatory torture hell itself.,27
And world's exile is death: then banished,27
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,27
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!,27
Taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law,27
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.,27
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog,27
Live here in heaven and may look on her;,27
More honourable state more courtship lives,27
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,27
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,27
But Romeo may not; he is banished:,27
They are free men but I am banished.,27
Hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharp-ground knife,27
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?,27
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,27
A sin-absolver and my friend profess'd,27
Thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word.,27
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:,27
To comfort thee though thou art banished.,27
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,27
It helps not it prevails not: talk no more.,27
How should they when that wise men have no eyes?,27
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:,27
An hour but married Tybalt murdered,27
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair,27
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.,27
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo hide thyself.,27
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.,27
Hark how they knock! Who's there? Romeo arise;,27
Knocking,27
What simpleness is this! I come I come!,27
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?,27
my errand;,27
Welcome then.,27
O holy friar O tell me holy friar,27
There on the ground with his own tears made drunk.,27
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!,27
Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering.,27
For Juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand;,27
Nurse!,27
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?,27
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy,27
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says,27
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps;,27
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,27
As if that name,27
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand,27
In what vile part of this anatomy,27
The hateful mansion.,27
Hold thy desperate hand:,27
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote,27
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!,27
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,27
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?,27
By doing damned hate upon thyself?,27
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet,27
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit;,27
And usest none in that true use indeed,27
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,27
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,27
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love,27
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,27
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.,27
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;,27
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:,27
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:,27
Happiness courts thee in her best array;,27
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:,27
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed,27
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,27
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time,27
Beg pardon of the prince and call thee back,27
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.,27
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,27
Romeo is coming.,27
To hear good counsel: O what learning is!,27
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide.,27
Hie you make haste for it grows very late.,27
How well my comfort is revived by this!,27
Either be gone before the watch be set,27
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,27
Every good hap to you that chances here:,27
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,27
Exeunt,27
Enter CAPULET LADY CAPULET and PARIS,27
That we have had no time to move our daughter:,27
And so did I:--Well we were born to die.,27
I promise you but for your company,27
These times of woe afford no time to woo.,27
I will and know her mind early to-morrow;,27
Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender,27
In all respects by me; nay more I doubt it not.,27
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;,27
But soft! what day is this?,27
Monday! ha ha! Well Wednesday is too soon,27
She shall be married to this noble earl.,27
We'll keep no great ado--a friend or two;,27
It may be thought we held him carelessly,27
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,27
My lord I would that Thursday were to-morrow.,27
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,27
Farewell my lord. Light to my chamber ho!,27
That we may call it early by and by.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above at the window,27
It was the nightingale and not the lark,27
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:,27
It was the lark the herald of the morn,27
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:,27
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.,27
Yon light is not day-light I know it I:,27
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,27
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.,27
I am content so thou wilt have it so.,27
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;,27
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:,27
Come death and welcome! Juliet wills it so.,27
It is it is: hie hence be gone away!,27
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.,27
This doth not so for she divideth us:,27
O now I would they had changed voices too!,27
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,27
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!,27
Madam!,27
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:,27
Exit,27
Farewell farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.,27
Art thou gone so? love lord ay husband friend!,27
For in a minute there are many days:,27
Ere I again behold my Romeo!,27
I will omit no opportunity,27
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?,27
For sweet discourses in our time to come.,27
Methinks I see thee now thou art below,27
Either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale.,27
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu adieu!,27
O fortune fortune! all men call thee fickle:,27
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle fortune;,27
But send him back.,27
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?,27
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?,27
Why how now Juliet!,27
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?,27
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live;,27
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.,27
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend,27
Feeling so the loss,27
Well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death,27
What villain madam?,27
[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--,27
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.,27
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands:,27
We will have vengeance for it fear thou not:,27
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,27
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:,27
Indeed I never shall be satisfied,27
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.,27
To bear a poison I would temper it;,27
Soon sleep in quiet. O how my heart abhors,27
To wreak the love I bore my cousin,27
Find thou the means and I'll find such a man.,27
And joy comes well in such a needy time:,27
Well well thou hast a careful father child;,27
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,27
Madam in happy time what day is that?,27
The gallant young and noble gentleman,27
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.,27
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.,27
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.,27
I will not marry yet; and when I do I swear,27
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!,27
And see how he will take it at your hands.,27
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew;,27
It rains downright.,27
Evermore showering? In one little body,27
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea,27
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs;,27
Without a sudden calm will overset,27
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?,27
I would the fool were married to her grave!,27
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?,27
Unworthy as she is that we have wrought,27
Not proud you have; but thankful that you have:,27
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.,27
Proud' and 'I thank you' and 'I thank you not;',27
Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds,27
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,27
Out you green-sickness carrion! out you baggage!,27
Fie fie! what are you mad?,27
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.,27
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,27
Speak not reply not do not answer me;,27
That God had lent us but this only child;,27
And that we have a curse in having her:,27
God in heaven bless her!,27
And why my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,27
I speak no treason.,27
May not one speak?,27
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;,27
You are too hot.,27
Day night hour tide time work play,27
To have her match'd: and having now provided,27
Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd,27
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;,27
A whining mammet in her fortune's tender,27
I am too young; I pray you pardon me.',27
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:,27
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart advise:,27
And you be not hang beg starve die in,27
For by my soul I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,27
Trust to't bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.,27
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,27
O sweet my mother cast me not away!,27
Or if you do not make the bridal bed,27
Talk not to me for I'll not speak a word:,27
Exit,27
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven;,27
Unless that husband send it me from heaven,27
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems,27
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?,27
Faith here it is.,27
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;,27
Then since the case so stands as now it doth,27
O he's a lovely gentleman!,27
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye,27
I think you are happy in this second match,27
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,27
Speakest thou from thy heart?,27
Or else beshrew them both.,27
What?,27
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,27
To make confession and to be absolved.,27
Exit,27
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,27
Which she hath praised him with above compare,27
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.,27
If all else fail myself have power to die.,27
ACT IV,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS,27
My father Capulet will have it so;,27
You say you do not know the lady's mind:,27
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,27
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.,27
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,27
To stop the inundation of her tears;,27
May be put from her by society:,27
[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.,27
Enter JULIET,27
That may be sir when I may be a wife.,27
What must be shall be.,27
Come you to make confession to this father?,27
Do not deny to him that you love me.,27
So will ye I am sure that you love me.,27
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.,27
The tears have got small victory by that;,27
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.,27
And what I spake I spake it to my face.,27
It may be so for it is not mine own.,27
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?,27
My lord we must entreat the time alone.,27
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye:,27
Exit,27
Come weep with me; past hope past cure past help!,27
It strains me past the compass of my wits:,27
On Thursday next be married to this county.,27
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:,27
Do thou but call my resolution wise,27
God join'd my heart and Romeo's thou our hands;,27
Shall be the label to another deed,27
Turn to another this shall slay them both:,27
Give me some present counsel or behold,27
Shall play the umpire arbitrating that,27
Could to no issue of true honour bring.,27
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.,27
Which craves as desperate an execution.,27
If rather than to marry County Paris,27
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake,27
That copest with death himself to scape from it:,27
O bid me leap rather than marry Paris,27
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk,27
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,27
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;,27
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;,27
And I will do it without fear or doubt,27
Hold then; go home be merry give consent,27
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;,27
Take thou this vial being then in bed,27
When presently through all thy veins shall run,27
Shall keep his native progress but surcease:,27
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade,27
Like death when he shuts up the day of life;,27
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death:,27
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,27
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes,27
Then as the manner of our country is,27
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault,27
In the mean time against thou shalt awake,27
And hither shall he come: and he and I,27
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.,27
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear,27
Give me give me! O tell not me of fear!,27
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed,27
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter CAPULET LADY  CAPULET Nurse and two Servingmen,27
Exit First Servant,27
You shall have none ill sir; for I'll try if they,27
How canst thou try them so?,27
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his,27
Go be gone.,27
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.,27
Ay forsooth.,27
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.,27
Enter JULIET,27
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin,27
To you and your behests and am enjoin'd,27
And beg your pardon: pardon I beseech you!,27
Send for the county; go tell him of this:,27
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;,27
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.,27
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;,27
Now afore God! this reverend holy friar,27
Nurse will you go with me into my closet,27
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?,27
Go nurse go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.,27
We shall be short in our provision:,27
Tush I will stir about,27
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her;,27
I'll play the housewife for this once. What ho!,27
To County Paris to prepare him up,27
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.,27
SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.,27
Ay those attires are best: but gentle nurse,27
For I have need of many orisons,27
Which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin.,27
What are you busy ho? need you my help?,27
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:,27
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;,27
In this so sudden business.,27
Get thee to bed and rest; for thou hast need.,27
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.,27
That almost freezes up the heat of life:,27
Nurse! What should she do here?,27
Come vial.,27
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?,27
Laying down her dagger,27
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,27
Because he married me before to Romeo?,27
For he hath still been tried a holy man.,27
I wake before the time that Romeo,27
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,27
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?,27
The horrible conceit of death and night,27
As in a vault an ancient receptacle,27
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:,27
Lies festering in his shroud; where as they say,27
Alack alack is it not like that I,27
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,27
O if I wake shall I not be distraught,27
And madly play with my forefather's joints?,27
And in this rage with some great kinsman's bone,27
O look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost,27
Upon a rapier's point: stay Tybalt stay!,27
She falls upon her bed within the curtains,27
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse,27
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.,27
Come stir stir stir! the second cock hath crow'd,27
Look to the baked meats good Angelica:,27
Go you cot-quean go,27
For this night's watching.,27
All night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick.,27
But I will watch you from such watching now.,27
A jealous hood a jealous hood!,27
Now fellow,27
Things for the cook sir; but I know not what.,27
Exit First Servant,27
Call Peter he will show thee where they are.,27
And never trouble Peter for the matter.,27
Mass and well said; a merry whoreson ha!,27
The county will be here with music straight,27
Music within,27
Re-enter Nurse,27
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie make haste,27
Make haste I say.,27
SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.,27
Mistress! what mistress! Juliet! fast I warrant her she:,27
Why love I say! madam! sweet-heart! why bride!,27
Sleep for a week; for the next night I warrant,27
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,27
I must needs wake her. Madam madam madam!,27
He'll fright you up i' faith. Will it not be?,27
What dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!,27
Alas alas! Help help! my lady's dead!,27
Some aqua vitae ho! My lord! my lady!,27
What noise is here?,27
What is the matter?,27
O me O me! My child my only life,27
Help help! Call help.,27
For shame bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.,27
Alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead!,27
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff;,27
Death lies on her like an untimely frost,27
O lamentable day!,27
Death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS with Musicians,27
Ready to go but never to return.,27
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,27
Death is my son-in-law Death is my heir;,27
And leave him all; life living all is Death's.,27
And doth it give me such a sight as this?,27
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw,27
But one poor one one poor and loving child,27
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!,27
Most lamentable day most woful day,27
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!,27
O woful day O woful day!,27
Most detestable death by thee beguil'd,27
O love! O life! not life but love in death!,27
Uncomfortable time why camest thou now,27
O child! O child! my soul and not my child!,27
And with my child my joys are buried.,27
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself,27
And all the better is it for the maid:,27
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.,27
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:,27
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself?,27
That you run mad seeing that she is well:,27
But she's best married that dies married young.,27
On this fair corse; and as the custom is,27
For though fond nature bids us an lament,27
All things that we ordained festival,27
Our instruments to melancholy bells,27
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,27
And all things change them to the contrary.,27
And go Sir Paris; every one prepare,27
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;,27
Exeunt CAPULET LADY CAPULET PARIS and FRIAR LAURENCE,27
Honest goodfellows ah put up put up;,27
Exit,27
Enter PETER,27
ease:' O an you will have me live play 'Heart's ease.',27
O musicians because my heart itself plays 'My,27
to comfort me.,27
You will not then?,27
I will then give it you soundly.,27
No money on my faith but the gleek;,27
Then I will give you the serving-creature.,27
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,27
An you re us and fa us you note us.,27
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you,27
me like men:,27
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,27
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver,27
Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound.,27
I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.,27
Faith I know not what to say.,27
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound',27
Then music with her silver sound,27
Exit,27
Hang him Jack! Come we'll in here; tarry for the,27
Exeunt,27
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.,27
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,27
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;,27
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.,27
Strange dream that gives a dead man leave,27
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,27
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,27
Enter BALTHASAR booted,27
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?,27
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;,27
Then she is well and nothing can be ill:,27
And her immortal part with angels lives.,27
And presently took post to tell it you:,27
Since you did leave it for my office sir.,27
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,27
I do beseech you sir have patience:,27
Some misadventure.,27
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.,27
No my good lord.,27
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.,27
Well Juliet I will lie with thee to-night.,27
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!,27
And hereabouts he dwells--which late I noted,27
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,27
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,27
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,27
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds,27
Were thinly scatter'd to make up a show.,27
An if a man did need a poison now,27
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.',27
And this same needy man must sell it me.,27
Being holiday the beggar's shop is shut.,27
Enter Apothecary,27
Come hither man. I see that thou art poor:,27
A dram of poison such soon-speeding gear,27
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,27
As violently as hasty powder fired,27
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law,27
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,27
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,27
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;,27
Then be not poor but break it and take this.,27
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.,27
And drink it off; and if you had the strength,27
There is thy gold worse poison to men's souls,27
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.,27
Farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh.,27
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.,27
SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.,27
Holy Franciscan friar! brother ho!,27
This same should be the voice of Friar John.,27
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter.,27
One of our order to associate me,27
And finding him the searchers of the town,27
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,27
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.,27
I could not send it--here it is again--,27
So fearful were they of infection.,27
The letter was not nice but full of charge,27
May do much danger. Friar John go hence;,27
Unto my cell.,27
Exit,27
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:,27
Hath had no notice of these accidents;,27
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;,27
Exit,27
Enter PARIS and his Page bearing flowers and a torch,27
Yet put it out for I would not be seen.,27
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;,27
Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves,27
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.,27
[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone,27
Retires,27
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--,27
Or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans:,27
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.,27
The boy gives warning something doth approach.,27
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?,27
Retires,27
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.,27
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.,27
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof,27
Why I descend into this bed of death,27
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger,27
In dear employment: therefore hence be gone:,27
In what I further shall intend to do,27
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:,27
More fierce and more inexorable far,27
I will be gone sir and not trouble you.,27
Live and be prosperous: and farewell good fellow.,27
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt.,27
Thou detestable maw thou womb of death,27
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,27
Opens the tomb,27
That murder'd my love's cousin with which grief,27
And here is come to do some villanous shame,27
Comes forward,27
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?,27
Obey and go with me; for thou must die.,27
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man;,27
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee youth,27
By urging me to fury: O be gone!,27
For I come hither arm'd against myself:,27
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.,27
And apprehend thee for a felon here.,27
They fight,27
Exit,27
Falls,27
Open the tomb lay me with Juliet.,27
In faith I will. Let me peruse this face.,27
What said my man when my betossed soul,27
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:,27
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet,27
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!,27
A grave? O no! a lantern slaughter'd youth,27
This vault a feasting presence full of light.,27
Laying PARIS in the tomb,27
Have they been merry! which their keepers call,27
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!,27
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:,27
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,27
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?,27
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain,27
Forgive me cousin! Ah dear Juliet,27
That unsubstantial death is amorous,27
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?,27
And never from this palace of dim night,27
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O here,27
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars,27
Arms take your last embrace! and lips O you,27
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!,27
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on,27
Here's to my love!,27
O true apothecary!,27
Dies,27
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night,27
Here's one a friend and one that knows you well.,27
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light,27
It burneth in the Capel's monument.,27
One that you love.,27
Romeo.,27
Full half an hour.,27
I dare not sir,27
And fearfully did menace me with death,27
Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:,27
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,27
And that my master slew him.,27
Advances,27
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?,27
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?,27
Romeo! O pale! Who else? what Paris too?,27
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!,27
JULIET wakes,27
I do remember well where I should be,27
Noise within,27
Of death contagion and unnatural sleep:,27
Hath thwarted our intents. Come come away.,27
And Paris too. Come I'll dispose of thee,27
Stay not to question for the watch is coming;,27
Noise again,27
Go get thee hence for I will not away.,27
What's here? a cup closed in my true love's hand?,27
O churl! drunk all and left no friendly drop,27
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,27
Kisses him,27
[Within]  Lead boy: which way?,27
Snatching ROMEO's dagger,27
Stabs herself,27
Falls on ROMEO's body and dies,27
This is the place; there where the torch doth burn.,27
Go some of you whoe'er you find attach.,27
And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead,27
Go tell the prince: run to the Capulets:,27
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;,27
We cannot without circumstance descry.,27
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.,27
Re-enter others of the Watch with FRIAR LAURENCE,27
We took this mattock and this spade from him,27
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.,27
What misadventure is so early up,27
Enter CAPULET LADY CAPULET and others,27
The people in the street cry Romeo,27
With open outcry toward our monument.,27
Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain;,27
Warm and new kill'd.,27
Here is a friar and slaughter'd Romeo's man;,27
These dead men's tombs.,27
This dagger hath mista'en--for lo his house,27
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!,27
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.,27
Come Montague; for thou art early up,27
Alas my liege my wife is dead to-night;,27
What further woe conspires against mine age?,27
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?,27
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,27
And know their spring their head their,27
And then will I be general of your woes,27
And let mischance be slave to patience.,27
I am the greatest able to do least,27
Doth make against me of this direful murder;,27
Myself condemned and myself excused.,27
I will be brief for my short date of breath,27
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet;,27
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day,27
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,27
You to remove that siege of grief from her,27
To County Paris: then comes she to me,27
To rid her from this second marriage,27
Then gave I her so tutor'd by my art,27
As I intended for it wrought on her,27
That he should hither come as this dire night,27
Being the time the potion's force should cease.,27
Was stay'd by accident and yesternight,27
At the prefixed hour of her waking,27
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,27
But when I came some minute ere the time,27
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.,27
And bear this work of heaven with patience:,27
And she too desperate would not go with me,27
All this I know; and to the marriage,27
Miscarried by my fault let my old life,27
Unto the rigour of severest law.,27
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?,27
And then in post he came from Mantua,27
This letter he early bid me give his father,27
I departed not and left him there.,27
Where is the county's page that raised the watch?,27
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;,27
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;,27
And then I ran away to call the watch.,27
Their course of love the tidings of her death:,27
Of a poor 'pothecary and therewithal,27
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!,27
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.,27
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.,27
This is my daughter's jointure for no more,27
But I can give thee more:,27
That while Verona by that name is known,27
As that of true and faithful Juliet.,27
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!,27
The sun for sorrow will not show his head:,27
Some shall be pardon'd and some punished:,27
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.,27
SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.,28
I'll pheeze you in faith.,28
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in,28
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!,28
No not a denier. Go by Jeronimy: go to thy cold,28
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the,28
Exit,28
by law: I'll not budge an inch boy: let him come,28
Falls asleep,28
Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds:,28
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.,28
At the hedge-corner in the coldest fault?,28
Why Belman is as good as he my lord;,28
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:,28
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,28
But sup them well and look unto them all:,28
I will my lord.,28
He breathes my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,28
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!,28
Sirs I will practise on this drunken man.,28
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers,28
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,28
Believe me lord I think he cannot choose.,28
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.,28
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,28
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,28
Procure me music ready when he wakes,28
And if he chance to speak be ready straight,28
Say 'What is it your honour will command?',28
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,28
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?',28
And ask him what apparel he will wear;,28
And that his lady mourns at his disease:,28
And when he says he is say that he dreams,28
This do and do it kindly gentle sirs:,28
If it be husbanded with modesty.,28
As he shall think by our true diligence,28
Take him up gently and to bed with him;,28
Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds,28
Exit Servingman,28
Travelling some journey to repose him here.,28
How now! who is it?,28
That offer service to your lordship.,28
Enter Players,28
We thank your honour.,28
So please your lordship to accept our duty.,28
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:,28
I have forgot your name; but sure that part,28
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.,28
Well you are come to me in a happy time;,28
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.,28
But I am doubtful of your modesties;,28
For yet his honour never heard a play--,28
And so offend him; for I tell you sirs,28
Fear not my lord: we can contain ourselves,28
Go sirrah take them to the buttery,28
Let them want nothing that my house affords.,28
Sirrah go you to Barthol'mew my page,28
That done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;,28
Tell him from me as he will win my love,28
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies,28
Such duty to the drunkard let him do,28
And say 'What is't your honour will command,28
May show her duty and make known her love?',28
And with declining head into his bosom,28
To see her noble lord restored to health,28
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:,28
To rain a shower of commanded tears,28
Which in a napkin being close convey'd,28
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:,28
Exit a Servingman,28
Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman:,28
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter,28
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence,28
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.,28
SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.,28
For God's sake a pot of small ale.,28
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?,28
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor,28
you give me any conserves give me conserves of,28
have no more doublets than backs no more stockings,28
sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my,28
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!,28
Of such possessions and so high esteem,28
What would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher,28
pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a,28
Ask Marian Hacket the fat ale-wife of Wincot if,28
on the score for sheer ale score me up for the,28
bestraught: here's--,28
O this is it that makes your servants droop!,28
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.,28
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,28
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,28
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,28
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:,28
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed,28
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:,28
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.,28
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?,28
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.,28
As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe.,28
Adonis painted by a running brook,28
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,28
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,28
As lively painted as the deed was done.,28
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,28
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.,28
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful,28
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee,28
She was the fairest creature in the world;,28
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?,28
I do not sleep: I see I hear I speak;,28
Upon my life I am a lord indeed,28
Well bring our lady hither to our sight;,28
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?,28
O that once more you knew but what you are!,28
Or when you waked so waked as if you slept.,28
But did I never speak of all that time?,28
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,28
And rail upon the hostess of the house;,28
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:,28
Ay the woman's maid of the house.,28
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,28
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell,28
Which never were nor no man ever saw.,28
Amen.,28
Enter the Page as a lady with attendants,28
Marry I fare well for here is cheer enough.,28
Here noble lord: what is thy will with her?,28
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.,28
I am your wife in all obedience.,28
Madam.,28
Madam' and nothing else: so lords,28
Madam wife they say that I have dream'd,28
Ay and the time seems thirty unto me,28
Tis much. Servants leave me and her alone.,28
Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you,28
Or if not so until the sun be set:,28
In peril to incur your former malady,28
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.,28
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into,28
despite of the flesh and the blood.,28
Your honour's players heating your amendment,28
For so your doctors hold it very meet,28
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:,28
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,28
Marry I will let them play it. Is not a,28
No my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.,28
It is a kind of history.,28
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.,28
ACT I,28
Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO,28
To see fair Padua nursery of arts,28
The pleasant garden of great Italy;,28
With his good will and thy good company,28
Here let us breathe and haply institute,28
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens,28
A merchant of great traffic through the world,28
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence,28
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:,28
Virtue and that part of philosophy,28
By virtue specially to be achieved.,28
And am to Padua come as he that leaves,28
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.,28
I am in all affected as yourself;,28
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.,28
This virtue and this moral discipline,28
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques,28
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,28
Music and poesy use to quicken you;,28
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;,28
In brief sir study what you most affect.,28
If Biondello thou wert come ashore,28
And take a lodging fit to entertain,28
But stay a while: what company is this?,28
Enter BAPTISTA KATHARINA BIANCA GREMIO and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by,28
For how I firmly am resolved you know;,28
Before I have a husband for the elder:,28
Because I know you well and love you well,28
[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.,28
I pray you sir is it your will,28
Mates maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,28
I'faith sir you shall never need to fear:,28
But if it were doubt not her care should be,28
And paint your face and use you like a fool.,28
And me too good Lord!,28
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.,28
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.,28
Well said master; mum! and gaze your fill.,28
What I have said Bianca get you in:,28
For I will love thee ne'er the less my girl.,28
Put finger in the eye an she knew why.,28
Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:,28
On them to took and practise by myself.,28
Signior Baptista will you be so strange?,28
Bianca's grief.,28
Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell,28
Gentlemen content ye; I am resolved:,28
Exit BIANCA,28
In music instruments and poetry,28
Fit to instruct her youth. If you Hortensio,28
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men,28
To mine own children in good bringing up:,28
For I have more to commune with Bianca.,28
Why and I trust I may go too may I not? What,28
knew not what to take and what to leave ha?,28
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so,28
so great Hortensio but we may blow our nails,28
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my,28
man to teach her that wherein she delights I will,28
So will I Signior Gremio: but a word I pray.,28
parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both,28
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love to,28
What's that I pray?,28
A husband! a devil.,28
I say a devil. Thinkest thou Hortensio though,28
to be married to hell?,28
to endure her loud alarums why man there be good,28
would take her with all faults and money enough.,28
this condition to be whipped at the high cross,28
Faith as you say there's small choice in rotten,28
friends it shall be so far forth friendly,28
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,28
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.,28
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best,28
thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the,28
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO,28
That love should of a sudden take such hold?,28
I never thought it possible or likely;,28
I found the effect of love in idleness:,28
That art to me as secret and as dear,28
Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio,28
Counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst;,28
Master it is no time to chide you now;,28
If love have touch'd you nought remains but so,28
Gramercies lad go forward; this contents:,28
Master you look'd so longly on the maid,28
O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face,28
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.,28
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister,28
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?,28
And with her breath she did perfume the air:,28
Nay then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.,28
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:,28
That till the father rid his hands of her,28
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,28
Ah Tranio what a cruel father's he!,28
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?,28
I have it Tranio.,28
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.,28
You will be schoolmaster,28
That's your device.,28
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,28
Keep house and ply his book welcome his friends,28
Basta; content thee for I have it full.,28
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces,28
Thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead,28
I will some other be some Florentine,28
Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio at once,28
When Biondello comes he waits on thee;,28
So had you need.,28
And I am tied to be obedient;,28
Be serviceable to my son' quoth he,28
I am content to be Lucentio,28
Tranio be so because Lucentio loves:,28
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.,28
Enter BIONDELLO,28
Where have I been! Nay how now! where are you?,28
you stolen his? or both? pray what's the news?,28
And therefore frame your manners to the time.,28
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,28
For in a quarrel since I came ashore,28
Wait you on him I charge you as becomes,28
You understand me?,28
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:,28
The better for him: would I were so too!,28
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.,28
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:,28
But in all places else your master Lucentio.,28
thyself execute to make one among these wooers: if,28
and weighty.,28
The presenters above speak,28
Yes by Saint Anne do I. A good matter surely:,28
My lord 'tis but begun.,28
would 'twere done!,28
SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.,28
Verona for a while I take my leave,28
My best beloved and approved friend,28
Here sirrah Grumio; knock I say.,28
rebused your worship?,28
Knock you here sir! why sir what am I sir that,28
Villain I say knock me at this gate,28
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock,28
And then I know after who comes by the worst.,28
Faith sirrah an you'll not knock I'll ring it;,28
He wrings him by the ears,28
Now knock when I bid you sirrah villain!,28
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!,28
Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray?,28
Alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor,28
this quarrel.,28
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his,28
him soundly sir: well was it fit for a servant to,28
two and thirty a pip out? Whom would to God I had,28
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,28
And could not get him for my heart to do it.,28
words plain 'Sirrah knock me here rap me here,28
now with 'knocking at the gate'?,28
Petruchio patience; I am Grumio's pledge:,28
Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio.,28
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?,28
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,28
Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me:,28
And I have thrust myself into this maze,28
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,28
Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee,28
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:,28
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,28
Signior Hortensio 'twixt such friends as we,28
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,28
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,28
As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse,28
Affection's edge in me were she as rough,28
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;,28
Nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his,28
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er,28
as two and fifty horses: why nothing comes amiss,28
Petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in,28
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife,28
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:,28
Is that she is intolerable curst,28
That were my state far worser than it is,28
Hortensio peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:,28
For I will board her though she chide as loud,28
Her father is Baptista Minola,28
Her name is Katharina Minola,28
I know her father though I know not her;,28
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her;,28
To give you over at this first encounter,28
I pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts.,28
would think scolding would do little good upon him:,28
why that's nothing; an he begin once he'll rail in,28
stand him but a little he will throw a figure in,28
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.,28
Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee,28
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,28
And her withholds from me and other more,28
Supposing it a thing impossible,28
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;,28
That none shall have access unto Bianca,28
Katharina the curst!,28
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,28
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster,28
That so I may by this device at least,28
And unsuspected court her by herself.,28
how the young folks lay their heads together!,28
Master master look about you: who goes there ha?,28
Petruchio stand by a while.,28
O very well; I have perused the note.,28
All books of love see that at any hand;,28
You understand me: over and beside,28
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,28
For she is sweeter than perfume itself,28
Whate'er I read to her I'll plead for you,28
As firmly as yourself were still in place:,28
Than you unless you were a scholar sir.,28
O this woodcock what an ass it is!,28
Grumio mum! God save you Signior Gremio.,28
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.,28
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:,28
On this young man for learning and behavior,28
And other books good ones I warrant ye.,28
Hath promised me to help me to another,28
So shall I no whit be behind in duty,28
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.,28
Gremio 'tis now no time to vent our love:,28
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.,28
Upon agreement from us to his liking,28
Yea and to marry her if her dowry please.,28
Hortensio have you told him all her faults?,28
If that be all masters I hear no harm.,28
Born in Verona old Antonio's son:,28
And I do hope good days and long to see.,28
But if you have a stomach to't i' God's name:,28
But will you woo this wild-cat?,28
Will he woo her? ay or I'll hang her.,28
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?,28
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds,28
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,28
Have I not in a pitched battle heard,28
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,28
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?,28
For he fears none.,28
This gentleman is happily arrived,28
I promised we would be contributors,28
And so we will provided that he win her.,28
Enter TRANIO brave and BIONDELLO,28
Tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way,28
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?,28
Hark you sir; you mean not her to--,28
Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray.,28
Well begun Tranio.,28
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no?,28
No; if without more words you will get you hence.,28
For me as for you?,28
For what reason I beseech you?,28
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.,28
Softly my masters! if you be gentlemen,28
Baptista is a noble gentleman,28
And were his daughter fairer than she is,28
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;,28
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,28
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.,28
Hortensio to what end are all these words?,28
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?,28
The one as famous for a scolding tongue,28
Sir sir the first's for me; let her go by.,28
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.,28
The younges t daughter whom you hearken for,28
And will not promise her to any man,28
The younger then is free and not before.,28
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,28
Achieve the elder set the younger free,28
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.,28
And since you do profess to be a suitor,28
To whom we all rest generally beholding.,28
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,28
And do as adversaries do in law,28
O excellent motion! Fellows let's be gone.,28
Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto.,28
ACT II,28
Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA,28
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;,28
Unbind my hands I'll pull them off myself,28
Or what you will command me will I do,28
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell,28
Believe me sister of all the men alive,28
Which I could fancy more than any other.,28
If you affect him sister here I swear,28
him.,28
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.,28
Nay then you jest and now I well perceive,28
I prithee sister Kate untie my hands.,28
Strikes her,28
Why how now dame! whence grows this insolence?,28
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.,28
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?,28
Her silence flouts me and I'll be revenged.,28
What in my sight? Bianca get thee in.,28
What will you not suffer me? Nay now I see,28
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day,28
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep,28
Exit,28
But who comes here?,28
Good morrow neighbour Baptista.,28
God save you gentlemen!,28
Call'd Katharina fair and virtuous?,28
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.,28
I am a gentleman of Verona sir,28
Her affability and bashful modesty,28
Am bold to show myself a forward guest,28
Of that report which I so oft have heard.,28
I do present you with a man of mine,28
Cunning in music and the mathematics,28
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:,28
His name is Licio born in Mantua.,28
But for my daughter Katharina this I know,28
I see you do not mean to part with her,28
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.,28
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,28
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.,28
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too:,28
O pardon me Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.,28
wooing. Neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am,28
that have been more kindly beholding to you than,28
Presenting LUCENTIO,28
in Greek Latin and other languages as the other,28
accept his service.,28
Welcome good Cambio.,28
But gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger:,28
Pardon me sir the boldness is mine own,28
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,28
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,28
This liberty is all that I request,28
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,28
And toward the education of your daughters,28
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:,28
Lucentio is your name; of whence I pray?,28
A mighty man of Pisa; by report,28
Take you the lute and you the set of books;,28
Holla within!,28
Sirrah lead these gentlemen,28
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.,28
We will go walk a little in the orchard,28
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.,28
And every day I cannot come to woo.,28
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,28
Then tell me if I get your daughter's love,28
After my death the one half of my lands,28
And for that dowry I'll assure her of,28
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:,28
That covenants may be kept on either hand.,28
That is her love; for that is all in all.,28
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;,28
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:,28
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:,28
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.,28
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.,28
That shake not though they blow perpetually.,28
How now my friend! why dost thou look so pale?,28
What will my daughter prove a good musician?,28
Iron may hold with her but never lutes.,28
Why no; for she hath broke the lute to me.,28
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;,28
Frets call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume,28
And with that word she struck me on the head,28
And there I stood amazed for a while,28
While she did call me rascal fiddler,28
As had she studied to misuse me so.,28
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:,28
Well go with me and be not so discomfited:,28
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.,28
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?,28
Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO,28
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.,28
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:,28
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:,28
Then I'll commend her volubility,28
If she do bid me pack I'll give her thanks,28
If she deny to wed I'll crave the day,28
But here she comes; and now Petruchio speak.,28
Good morrow Kate; for that's your name I hear.,28
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.,28
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;,28
Kate of Kate Hall my super-dainty Kate,28
Take this of me Kate of my consolation;,28
Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded,28
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.,28
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first,28
Why what's a moveable?,28
Thou hast hit it: come sit on me.,28
Women are made to bear and so are you.,28
Alas! good Kate I will not burden thee;,28
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;,28
Should be! should--buzz!,28
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?,28
Come come you wasp; i' faith you are too angry.,28
My remedy is then to pluck it out.,28
Who knows not where a wasp does,28
In his tongue.,28
Yours if you talk of tails: and so farewell.,28
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.,28
She strikes him,28
So may you lose your arms:,28
And if no gentleman why then no arms.,28
What is your crest? a coxcomb?,28
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.,28
It is my fashion when I see a crab.,28
There is there is.,28
Had I a glass I would.,28
Well aim'd of such a young one.,28
Yet you are wither'd.,28
I care not.,28
I chafe you if I tarry: let me go.,28
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,28
For thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous,28
Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance,28
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,28
With gentle conference soft and affable.,28
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig,28
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.,28
Go fool and whom thou keep'st command.,28
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?,28
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!,28
It is extempore from my mother-wit.,28
Am I not wise?,28
Marry so I mean sweet Katharina in thy bed:,28
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented,28
And Will you nill you I will marry you.,28
For by this light whereby I see thy beauty,28
Thou must be married to no man but me;,28
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate,28
Here comes your father: never make denial;,28
Re-enter BAPTISTA GREMIO and TRANIO,28
How but well sir? how but well?,28
Why how now daughter Katharina! in your dumps?,28
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,28
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,28
Father 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,28
If she be curst it is for policy,28
She is not hot but temperate as the morn;,28
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:,28
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.,28
Hark Petruchio; she says she'll see thee,28
Is this your speeding? nay then good night our part!,28
If she and I be pleased what's that to you?,28
That she shall still be curst in company.,28
How much she loves me: O the kindest Kate!,28
She vied so fast protesting oath on oath,28
O you are novices! 'tis a world to see,28
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.,28
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.,28
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.,28
God send you joy Petruchio! 'tis a match.,28
Father and wife and gentlemen adieu;,28
We will have rings and things and fine array;,28
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally,28
Faith gentlemen now I play a merchant's part,28
Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:,28
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.,28
But now Baptists to your younger daughter:,28
I am your neighbour and was suitor first.,28
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.,28
Graybeard thy love doth freeze.,28
Skipper stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.,28
Content you gentlemen: I will compound this strife:,28
That can assure my daughter greatest dower,28
Say Signior Gremio What can you assure her?,28
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;,28
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;,28
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,28
Fine linen Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,28
Pewter and brass and all things that belong,28
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,28
And all things answerable to this portion.,28
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,28
That 'only' came well in. Sir list to me:,28
If I may have your daughter to my wife,28
Within rich Pisa walls as any one,28
Besides two thousand ducats by the year,28
What have I pinch'd you Signior Gremio?,28
My land amounts not to so much in all:,28
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.,28
Gremio 'tis known my father hath no less,28
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,28
Nay I have offer'd all I have no more;,28
If you like me she shall have me and mine.,28
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.,28
And let your father make her the assurance,28
if you should die before him where's her dower?,28
And may not young men die as well as old?,28
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know,28
Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca,28
If not Signior Gremio:,28
Adieu good neighbour.,28
Now I fear thee not:,28
To give thee all and in his waning age,28
An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy.,28
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!,28
Tis in my head to do my master good:,28
Must get a father call'd 'supposed Vincentio;',28
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,28
Exit,28
SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.,28
Fiddler forbear; you grow too forward sir:,28
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?,28
The patroness of heavenly harmony:,28
And when in music we have spent an hour,28
Preposterous ass that never read so far,28
Was it not to refresh the mind of man,28
Then give me leave to read philosophy,28
Sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine.,28
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:,28
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,28
And to cut off all strife here sit we down:,28
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.,28
That will be never: tune your instrument.,28
Here madam:,28
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.',28
Hic ibat' as I told you before 'Simois' I am,28
Sigeia tellus' disguised thus to get your love;,28
a-wooing 'Priami' is my man Tranio 'regia',28
beguile the old pantaloon.,28
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.,28
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat,28
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami' take heed,28
despair not.,28
All but the base.,28
Aside,28
Now for my life the knave doth court my love:,28
In time I may believe yet I mistrust.,28
Was Ajax call'd so from his grandfather.,28
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:,28
Good masters take it not unkindly pray,28
You may go walk and give me leave a while:,28
Are you so formal sir? well I must wait,28
And watch withal; for but I be deceived,28
Madam before you touch the instrument,28
I must begin with rudiments of art;,28
More pleasant pithy and effectual,28
And there it is in writing fairly drawn.,28
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.,28
A re' to Plead Hortensio's passion;,28
C fa ut' that loves with all affection:,28
E la mi' show pity or I die.',28
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,28
Enter a Servant,28
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:,28
Farewell sweet masters both; I must be gone.,28
Faith mistress then I have no cause to stay.,28
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:,28
Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble,28
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,28
Exit,28
Enter BAPTISTA GREMIO TRANIO KATHARINA BIANCA LUCENTIO and others attendants,28
pointed day.,28
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.,28
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends,28
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?,28
To give my hand opposed against my heart,28
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.,28
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:,28
He'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage,28
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.,28
And say 'Lo there is mad Petruchio's wife,28
Patience good Katharina and Baptista too.,28
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:,28
Though he be merry yet withal he's honest.,28
Exit weeping followed by BIANCA and others,28
For such an injury would vex a very saint,28
Enter BIONDELLO,28
you never heard of!,28
Why is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?,28
Why no sir.,28
He is coming.,28
When he stands where I am and sees you there.,28
Why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old,28
of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled,28
town-armory with a broken hilt and chapeless;,28
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;,28
in the chine; troubled with the lampass infected,28
spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives,28
bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;,28
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which being,28
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth,28
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down,28
Who comes with him?,28
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a,28
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty,28
very monster in apparel and not like a Christian,28
Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;,28
I am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes.,28
Didst thou not say he comes?,28
Ay that Petruchio came.,28
Why that's all one.,28
I hold you a penny,28
Is more than one,28
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO,28
You are welcome sir.,28
And yet you halt not.,28
As I wish you were.,28
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?,28
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,28
Some comet or unusual prodigy?,28
First were we sad fearing you would not come;,28
Fie doff this habit shame to your estate,28
And tells us what occasion of import,28
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?,28
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,28
Which at more leisure I will so excuse,28
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:,28
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:,28
Not I believe me: thus I'll visit her.,28
Good sooth even thus; therefore ha' done with words:,28
Could I repair what she will wear in me,28
Twere well for Kate and better for myself.,28
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,28
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO,28
We will persuade him be it possible,28
I'll after him and see the event of this.,28
But to her love concerneth us to add,28
As I before unparted to your worship,28
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn--,28
And make assurance here in Padua,28
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,28
Were it not that my fellow-school-master,28
Twere good methinks to steal our marriage;,28
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.,28
And watch our vantage in this business:,28
The narrow-prying father Minola,28
All for my master's sake Lucentio.,28
Signior Gremio came you from the church?,28
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?,28
A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find.,28
Why he's a devil a devil a very fiend.,28
Tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him!,28
Should ask if Katharina should be his wife,28
That all-amazed the priest let fall the book;,28
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff,28
Now take them up' quoth he 'if any list.',28
Trembled and shook; for why he stamp'd and swore,28
But after many ceremonies done,28
He had been aboard carousing to his mates,28
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;,28
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,28
This done he took the bride about the neck,28
That at the parting all the church did echo:,28
And after me I know the rout is coming.,28
Hark hark! I hear the minstrels play.,28
Re-enter PETRUCHIO KATHARINA BIANCA BAPTISTA HORTENSIO GRUMIO and Train,28

Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,28
And honest company I thank you all,28
To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife:,28
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.,28
It may not be.,28
It cannot be.,28
I am content.,28
I am content you shall entreat me stay;,28
Now if you love me stay.,28
Ay sir they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.,28
Do what thou canst I will not go to-day;,28
The door is open sir; there lies your way;,28
For me I'll not be gone till I please myself:,28
That take it on you at the first so roundly.,28
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?,28
Ay marry sir now it begins to work.,28
I see a woman may be made a fool,28
They shall go forward Kate at thy command.,28
Go to the feast revel and domineer,28
Be mad and merry or go hang yourselves:,28
Nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret;,28
She is my goods my chattels; she is my house,28
My horse my ox my ass my any thing;,28
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he,28
Draw forth thy weapon we are beset with thieves;,28
Fear not sweet wench they shall not touch,28
I'll buckler thee against a million.,28
Nay let them go a couple of quiet ones.,28
Of all mad matches never was the like.,28
That being mad herself she's madly mated.,28
Neighbours and friends though bride and,28
For to supply the places at the table,28

Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?,28
Exeunt,28
SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.,28
Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and,28
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent,28

tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my,28
I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,28
take cold. Holla ho! Curtis.,28
Who is that calls so coldly?,28
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run,28
Is my master and his wife coming Grumio?,28
on no water.,28
She was good Curtis before this frost: but thou,28
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and,28
Away you three-inch fool! I am no beast.,28
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a,28
whose hand she being now at hand thou shalt soon,28
I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world?,28
therefore fire: do thy duty and have thy duty; for,28
There's fire ready; and therefore good Grumio the news.,28
will thaw.,28
Why therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.,28
trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept; the,28
stockings and every officer his wedding-garment on?,28
the carpets laid and every thing in order?,28
First know my horse is tired; my master and,28
How?,28

Lend thine ear.,28
There.,28
This is to feel a tale not to hear a tale.,28
cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech,28
foul hill my master riding behind my mistress--,28
What's that to thee?,28
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,28
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how,28
with the horse upon her how he beat me because,28
to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed,28
horses ran away how her bridle was burst how I,28
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return,28
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.,28
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?,28
Walter Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be,28
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy,28
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their,28
They are.,28
Do you hear ho? you must meet my master to,28
Why she hath a face of her own.,28
Thou it seems that calls for company to,28

You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!,28
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?,28
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;,28
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:,28
The rest were ragged old and beggarly;,28
Go rascals go and fetch my supper in.,28
Singing,28
Where are those--Sit down Kate and welcome.--,28
Re-enter Servants with supper,28
Off with my boots you rogues! you villains when?,28
It was the friar of orders grey,28
Out you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:,28
Strikes him,28
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah get you hence,28
One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with.,28
Enter one with water,28
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?,28
Patience I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.,28
Come Kate sit down; I know you have a stomach.,28
What's this? mutton?,28
Who brought it?,28
Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.,28
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser,28
Theretake it to you trenchers cups and all;,28
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!,28
I pray you husband be not so disquiet:,28
I tell thee Kate 'twas burnt and dried away;,28
For it engenders choler planteth anger;,28
Since of ourselves ourselves are choleric,28
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,28
Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.,28
Re-enter Servants severally,28
He kills her in her own humour.,28
Where is he?,28
And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul,28
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.,28
Exeunt,28
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,28
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;,28
For then she never looks upon her lure.,28
To make her come and know her keeper's call,28
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.,28
Last night she slept not nor to-night she shall not;,28
I'll find about the making of the bed;,28
This way the coverlet another way the sheets:,28
That all is done in reverend care of her;,28
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl,28
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;,28
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,28
Exit,28
Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO,28
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?,28
Sir to satisfy you in what I have said,28
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO,28
What master read you? first resolve me that.,28
And may you prove sir master of your art!,28
Quick proceeders marry! Now tell me I pray,28
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.,28
I tell thee Licio this is wonderful.,28
Nor a musician as I seem to be;,28
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,28
Know sir that I am call'd Hortensio.,28
Of your entire affection to Bianca;,28
I will with you if you be so contented,28
See how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,28
Never to woo her no more but do forswear her,28
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.,28
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:,28
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!,28
I will be married to a wealthy widow,28
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.,28
Kindness in women not their beauteous looks,28
In resolution as I swore before.,28
Mistress Bianca bless you with such grace,28
Nay I have ta'en you napping gentle love,28
Tranio you jest: but have you both forsworn me?,28
Then we are rid of Licio.,28
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.,28
Ay and he'll tame her.,28
Faith he is gone unto the taming-school.,28
Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master;,28
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.,28
O master master I have watch'd so long,28
An ancient angel coming down the hill,28
What is he Biondello?,28
I know not what; but format in apparel,28
And what of him Tranio?,28
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,28
As if he were the right Vincentio,28
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA,28
God save you sir!,28
Travel you far on or are you at the farthest?,28
But then up farther and as for as Rome;,28
What countryman I pray?,28
Of Mantua sir? marry God forbid!,28
My life sir! how I pray? for that goes hard.,28
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?,28
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,28
Tis marvel but that you are but newly come,28
Alas! sir it is worse for me than so;,28
From Florence and must here deliver them.,28
This will I do and this I will advise you:,28
Ay sir in Pisa have I often been,28
Among them know you one Vincentio?,28
A merchant of incomparable wealth.,28
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.,28
and all one.,28
This favour will I do you for his sake;,28
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.,28
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:,28
You understand me sir: so shall you stay,28
If this be courtesy sir accept of it.,28
The patron of my life and liberty.,28
This by the way I let you understand;,28
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage,28
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:,28
Exeunt,28
Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO,28
The more my wrong the more his spite appears:,28
Beggars that come unto my father's door,28
If not elsewhere they meet with charity:,28
Nor never needed that I should entreat,28
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:,28
He does it under name of perfect love;,28
Twere deadly sickness or else present death.,28
I care not what so it be wholesome food.,28
Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.,28
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?,28
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.,28
A dish that I do love to feed upon.,28
Why then the beef and let the mustard rest.,28
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.,28
Why then the mustard without the beef.,28
Beats him,28
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,28
Go get thee gone I say.,28
How fares my Kate? What sweeting all amort?,28
Faith as cold as can be.,28
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am,28
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks.,28
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.,28
I pray you let it stand.,28
And so shall mine before you touch the meat.,28
Signior Petruchio fie! you are to blame.,28
[Aside]  Eat it up all Hortensio if thou lovest me.,28
Kate eat apace: and now my honey love,28
And revel it as bravely as the best,28
With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;,28
With amber bracelets beads and all this knavery.,28
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.,28
Come tailor let us see these ornaments;,28
Enter Haberdasher,28
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.,28
A velvet dish: fie fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:,28
A knack a toy a trick a baby's cap:,28
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,28
When you are gentle you shall have one too,28
[Aside]  That will not be in haste.,28
And speak I will; I am no child no babe:,28
And if you cannot best you stop your ears.,28
Or else my heart concealing it will break,28
Even to the uttermost as I please in words.,28
A custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie:,28
Love me or love me not I like the cap;,28
Exit Haberdasher,28
O mercy God! what masquing stuff is here?,28
What up and down carved like an apple-tart?,28
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:,28
[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.,28
According to the fashion and the time.,28
I did not bid you mar it to the time.,28
For you shall hop without my custom sir:,28
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,28
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.,28
She says your worship means to make,28
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest thou thread,28
Thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail!,28
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?,28
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard,28
I tell thee I that thou hast marr'd her gown.,28
Just as my master had direction:,28
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.,28
Marry sir with needle and thread.,28
Thou hast faced many things.,28
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not,28
thee I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did,28
Why here is the note of the fashion to testify,28
The note lies in's throat if he say I said so.,28
Master if ever I said loose-bodied gown sew me in,28
of brown thread: I said a gown.,28
[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:',28
[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:',28
[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.',28
Error i' the bill sir; error i' the bill.,28
sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,28
This is true that I say: an I had thee,28
I am for thee straight: take thou the,28
God-a-mercy Grumio! then he shall have no odds.,28
You are i' the right sir: 'tis for my mistress.,28
Villain not for thy life: take up my mistress',28
Why sir what's your conceit in that?,28
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!,28
[Aside]  Hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid.,28
Tailor I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:,28
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.,28
Well come my Kate; we will unto your father's,28
Our purses shall be proud our garments poor;,28
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,28
What is the jay more precious than the lark,28
Or is the adder better than the eel,28
O no good Kate; neither art thou the worse,28
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;,28
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.,28
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;,28
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,28
I dare assure you sir 'tis almost two;,28
It shall be seven ere I go to horse:,28
You are still crossing it. Sirs let't alone:,28
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.,28
Exeunt,28
Enter TRANIO and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO,28
Ay what else? and but I be deceived,28
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,28
Tis well; and hold your own in any case,28
I warrant you.,28
But sir here comes your boy;,28
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,28
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.,28
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?,28
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.,28
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance sir.,28
Signior Baptista you are happily met.,28
Sir this is the gentleman I told you of:,28
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.,28
Sir by your leave: having come to Padua,28
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause,28
And for the good report I hear of you,28
And she to him to stay him not too long,28
To have him match'd; and if you please to like,28
Me shall you find ready and willing,28
For curious I cannot be with you,28
Sir pardon me in what I have to say:,28
Right true it is your son Lucentio here,28
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:,28
That like a father you will deal with him,28
The match is made and all is done:,28
I thank you sir. Where then do you know best,28
As shall with either part's agreement stand?,28
Pitchers have ears and I have many servants:,28
And happily we might be interrupted.,28
There doth my father lie; and there this night,28
Send for your daughter by your servant here:,28
The worst is this that at so slender warning,28
It likes me well. Biondello hie you home,28
And if you will tell what hath happened,28
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.,28
Dally not with the gods but get thee gone.,28
Signior Baptista shall I lead the way?,28
Come sir; we will better it in Pisa.,28
Exeunt TRANIO Pedant and BAPTISTA,28
Cambio!,28
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?,28
Faith nothing; but has left me here behind to,28
I pray thee moralize them.,28
deceiving father of a deceitful son.,28
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.,28
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your,28
And what of all this?,28
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,28
church; take the priest clerk and some sufficient,28
I have no more to say But bid Bianca farewell for,28
Hearest thou Biondello?,28
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to,28
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint,28
you come with your appendix.,28
I may and will if she be so contented:,28
Hap what hap may I'll roundly go about her:,28
Exit,28
Enter PETRUCHIO KATHARINA HORTENSIO and Servants,28
Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon!,28
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.,28
Now by my mother's son and that's myself,28
Or ere I journey to your father's house.,28
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!,28
Forward I pray since we have come so far,28
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,28
I say it is the moon.,28
Nay then you lie: it is the blessed sun.,28
But sun it is not when you say it is not;,28
What you will have it named even that it is;,28
Petruchio go thy ways; the field is won.,28
And not unluckily against the bias.,28
Enter VINCENTIO,28
Good morrow gentle mistress: where away?,28
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?,28
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,28
Fair lovely maid once more good day to thee.,28
A' will make the man mad to make a woman of him.,28
Whither away or where is thy abode?,28
Happier the man whom favourable stars,28
Why how now Kate! I hope thou art not mad:,28
And not a maiden as thou say'st he is.,28
That have been so bedazzled with the sun,28
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;,28
Do good old grandsire; and withal make known,28
We shall be joyful of thy company.,28
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,28
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit,28
What is his name?,28
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.,28
I may entitle thee my loving father:,28
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,28
Her dowery wealthy and of worthy birth;,28
The spouse of any noble gentleman.,28
And wander we to see thy honest son,28
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,28
Upon the company you overtake?,28
Come go along and see the truth hereof;,28
Exeunt all but HORTENSIO,28
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,28
Exit,28
SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.,28
Softly and swiftly sir; for the priest is ready.,28
at home; therefore leave us.,28
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.,28
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.,28
Sir here's the door this is Lucentio's house:,28
Thither must I and here I leave you sir.,28
I think I shall command your welcome here,28
Knocks,28
Pedant looks out of the window,28
Is Signior Lucentio within sir?,28
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to,28
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall,28
Nay I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.,28
I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is,28
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here,28
Art thou his father?,28
[To VINCENTIO]  Why how now gentleman! why this,28
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to,28
Re-enter BIONDELLO,28
em good shipping! But who is here? mine old,28
[Seeing BIONDELLO],28
Hope I may choose sir.,28
Forgot you! no sir: I could not forget you for I,28
What you notorious villain didst thou never see,28
What my old worshipful old master? yes marry sir:,28
Is't so indeed.,28
Help help help! here's a madman will murder me.,28
Help son! help Signior Baptista!,28
Prithee Kate let's stand aside and see the end of,28
They retire,28
Sir what are you that offer to beat my servant?,28
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet,28
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good,28
the university.,28
What is the man lunatic?,28
habit but your words show you a madman. Why sir,28
thank my good father I am able to maintain it.,28
You mistake sir you mistake sir. Pray what do,28
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought,28
name is Tranio.,28
mine only son and heir to the lands of me Signior Vincentio.,28
on him I charge you in the duke's name. O my,28
Call forth an officer.,28
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,28
Carry me to the gaol!,28
Talk not Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.,28
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this,28
Swear if thou darest.,28
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.,28
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!,28
monstrous villain!,28
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,28
[Kneeling]  Pardon sweet father.,28
Exeunt BIONDELLO TRANIO and Pedant as fast as may be,28
How hast thou offended?,28
Here's Lucentio,28
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,28
Here's packing with a witness to deceive us all!,28
That faced and braved me in this matter so?,28
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.,28
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,28
And happily I have arrived at the last,28
What Tranio did myself enforced him to;,28
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent,28
But do you hear sir? have you married my daughter,28
Fear not Baptista; we will content you go to: but,28
Exit,28
Exit,28
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA,28
Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.,28
Husband let's follow to see the end of this ado.,28
What in the midst of the street?,28
No sir God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.,28
Nay I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee love stay.,28
Better once than never for never too late.,28
SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.,28
At last though long our jarring notes agree:,28
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.,28
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.,28
And thou Hortensio with thy loving widow,28
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,28
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.,28
Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio.,28
For both our sakes I would that word were true.,28
Then never trust me if I be afeard.,28
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.,28
Roundly replied.,28
Thus I conceive by him.,28
My widow says thus she conceives her tale.,28
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:',28
Your husband being troubled with a shrew,28
And now you know my meaning,28
Right I mean you.,28
To her Kate!,28
A hundred marks my Kate does put her down.,28
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee lad!,28
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?,28
Head and butt! an hasty-witted body,28
Ay mistress bride hath that awaken'd you?,28
Nay that you shall not: since you have begun,28
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;,28
You are welcome all.,28
She hath prevented me. Here Signior Tranio.,28
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.,28
Which runs himself and catches for his master.,28
Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself:,28
O ho Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.,28
Confess confess hath he not hit you here?,28
And as the jest did glance away from me,28
Now in good sadness son Petruchio,28
Well I say no: and therefore for assurance,28
And he whose wife is most obedient,28
Shall win the wager which we will propose.,28
Twenty crowns.,28
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,28
A hundred then.,28
A match! 'tis done.,28
That will I.,28
I go.,28
Son I'll be your half Bianca comes.,28
Re-enter BIONDELLO,28
Sir my mistress sends you word,28
How! she is busy and she cannot come!,28
Ay and a kind one too:,28
I hope better.,28
To come to me forthwith.,28
O ho! entreat her!,28
I am afraid sir,28
Re-enter BIONDELLO,28
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:,28
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,28
Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress;,28
Exit GRUMIO,28
What?,28
The fouler fortune mine and there an end.,28
Re-enter KATARINA,28
Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife?,28
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.,28
Away I say and bring them hither straight.,28
Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder.,28
Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life,28
And to be short what not that's sweet and happy?,28
The wager thou hast won; and I will add,28
Another dowry to another daughter,28
Nay I will win my wager better yet,28
Her new-built virtue and obedience.,28
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.,28
Katharina that cap of yours becomes you not:,28
Lord let me never have a cause to sigh,28
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?,28
The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca,28
The more fool you for laying on my duty.,28
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.,28
Come on I say; and first begin with her.,28
I say she shall: and first begin with her.,28
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,28
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,28
And in no sense is meet or amiable.,28
Muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty;,28
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.,28
Thy head thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,28
To painful labour both by sea and land,28
Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe;,28
But love fair looks and true obedience;,28
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,28
And when she is froward peevish sullen sour,28
What is she but a foul contending rebel,28
I am ashamed that women are so simple,28
Or seek for rule supremacy and sway,28
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,28
But that our soft conditions and our hearts,28
Come come you froward and unable worms!,28
My heart as great my reason haply more,28
But now I see our lances are but straws,28
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.,28
And place your hands below your husband's foot:,28
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.,28
Well go thy ways old lad; for thou shalt ha't.,28
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.,28
We three are married but you two are sped.,28
Twas I won the wager though you hit the white;,28
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA,28
Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so.,28
ACT I,29
of thunder and lightning heard.,29
Boatswain!,29
Good speak to the mariners: fall to't yarely,29
Exit,29
Heigh my hearts! cheerly cheerly my hearts!,29
master's whistle. Blow till thou burst thy wind,29
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO FERDINAND GONZALO and others,29
Play the men.,29
Where is the master boatswain?,29
cabins: you do assist the storm.,29
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers,29
Good yet remember whom thou hast aboard.,29
counsellor; if you can command these elements to,29
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you,29
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of,29
of our way I say.,29
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he,29
perfect gallows. Stand fast good Fate to his,29
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not,29
Exeunt,29
Down with the topmast! yare! lower lower! Bring,29
A cry within,29
the weather or our office.,29
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er,29
A pox o' your throat you bawling blasphemous,29
Work you then.,29
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.,29
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an,29
Lay her a-hold a-hold! set her two courses off to,29
Enter Mariners wet,29
What must our mouths be cold?,29
For our case is as theirs.,29
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:,29
The washing of ten tides!,29
Though every drop of water swear against it,29
A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split we split!'--'Farewell my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell brother!'--'We split we split we split!',29
Let's take leave of him.,29
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an,29
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain,29
Exeunt,29
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA,29
Put the wild waters in this roar allay them.,29
But that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek,29
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,29
Dash'd all to pieces. O the cry did knock,29
Had I been any god of power I would,29
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and,29
Be collected:,29
There's no harm done.,29
No harm.,29
Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who,29
Of whence I am nor that I am more better,29
And thy no greater father.,29
Did never meddle with my thoughts.,29
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,29
Lays down his mantle,29
The direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd,29
I have with such provision in mine art,29
No not so much perdition as an hair,29
Which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;,29
You have often,29
And left me to a bootless inquisition,29
The hour's now come;,29
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember,29
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not,29
Certainly sir I can.,29
Of any thing the image tell me that,29
Tis far off,29
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not,29
Thou hadst and more Miranda. But how is it,29
In the dark backward and abysm of time?,29
How thou camest here thou mayst.,29
Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since,29
A prince of power.,29
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and,29
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir,29
O the heavens!,29
Or blessed was't we did?,29
By foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence,29
O my heart bleeds,29
Which is from my remembrance! Please you farther.,29
I pray thee mark me--that a brother should,29
Of all the world I loved and to him put,29
Through all the signories it was the first,29
In dignity and for the liberal arts,29
The government I cast upon my brother,29
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--,29
Sir most heedfully.,29
How to deny them who to advance and who,29
The creatures that were mine I say or changed 'em,29
Of officer and office set all hearts i' the state,29
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,29
O good sir I do.,29
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated,29
With that which but by being so retired,29
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,29
A falsehood in its contrary as great,29
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,29
But what my power might else exact like one,29
Made such a sinner of his memory,29
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,29
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--,29
Your tale sir would cure deafness.,29
And him he play'd it for he needs will be,29
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties,29
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples,29
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend,29
To most ignoble stooping.,29
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me,29
I should sin,29
Good wombs have borne bad sons.,29
The King of Naples being an enemy,29
Which was that he in lieu o' the premises,29
Should presently extirpate me and mine,29
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,29
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open,29
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence,29
Alack for pity!,29
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint,29
Hear a little further,29
Which now's upon's; without the which this story,29
Wherefore did they not,29
Well demanded wench:,29
So dear the love my people bore me nor set,29
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.,29
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared,29
Nor tackle sail nor mast; the very rats,29
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh,29
Did us but loving wrong.,29
Was I then to you!,29
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.,29
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,29
An undergoing stomach to bear up,29
How came we ashore?,29
Some food we had and some fresh water that,29
Out of his charity being then appointed,29
Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries,29
Knowing I loved my books he furnish'd me,29
I prize above my dukedom.,29
But ever see that man!,29
Resumes his mantle,29
Here in this island we arrived; and here,29
Than other princesses can that have more time,29
Heavens thank you for't! And now I pray you sir,29
For raising this sea-storm?,29
By accident most strange bountiful Fortune,29
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience,29
A most auspicious star whose influence,29
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:,29
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.,29
Come away servant come. I am ready now.,29
Enter ARIEL,29
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,29
On the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task,29
Hast thou spirit,29
To every article.,29
Now in the waist the deck in every cabin,29
And burn in many places; on the topmast,29
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings the precursors,29
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks,29
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,29
My brave spirit!,29
Would not infect his reason?,29
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd,29
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,29
With hair up-staring--then like reeds not hair--,29
And all the devils are here.',29
But was not this nigh shore?,29
But are they Ariel safe?,29
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,29
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.,29
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs,29
His arms in this sad knot.,29
The mariners say how thou hast disposed,29
Safely in harbour,29
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew,29
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;,29
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet,29
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,29
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd,29
Ariel thy charge,29
What is the time o' the day?,29
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now,29
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,29
Which is not yet perform'd me.,29
What is't thou canst demand?,29
Before the time be out? no more!,29
Remember I have done thee worthy service;,29
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise,29
Dost thou forget,29
No.,29
Of the salt deep,29
To do me business in the veins o' the earth,29
I do not sir.,29
The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy,29
No sir.,29
Sir in Argier.,29
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,29
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible,29
Thou know'st was banish'd: for one thing she did,29
Ay sir.,29
And here was left by the sailors. Thou my slave,29
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate,29
Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee,29
And in her most unmitigable rage,29
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain,29
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans,29
Save for the son that she did litter here,29
A human shape.,29
Dull thing I say so; he that Caliban,29
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans,29
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment,29
Could not again undo: it was mine art,29
The pine and let thee out.,29
If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak,29
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.,29
I will be correspondent to command,29
Do so and after two days,29
That's my noble master!,29
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject,29
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,29
Exit ARIEL,29
The strangeness of your story put,29
Shake it off. Come on;,29
Yields us kind answer.,29
I do not love to look on.,29
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,29
That profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!,29
[Within]  There's wood enough within.,29
Come thou tortoise! when?,29
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,29
My lord it shall be done.,29
Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself,29
Enter CALIBAN,29
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen,29
And blister you all o'er!,29
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins,29
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd,29
Than bees that made 'em.,29
This island's mine by Sycorax my mother,29
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me,29
To name the bigger light and how the less,29
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,29
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms,29
For I am all the subjects that you have,29
In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me,29
Thou most lying slave,29
Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee,29
The honour of my child.,29
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else,29
Abhorred slave,29
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,29
One thing or other: when thou didst not savage,29
A thing most brutish I endow'd thy purposes,29
Though thou didst learn had that in't which,29
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou,29
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.,29
Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you,29
Hag-seed hence!,29
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou malice?,29
What I command I'll rack thee with old cramps,29
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.,29
Aside,29
It would control my dam's god Setebos,29
So slave; hence!,29
Re-enter ARIEL invisible playing and singing; FERDINAND following,29
Come unto these yellow sands,29
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd,29
Foot it featly here and there;,29
Hark hark!,29
The watch-dogs bark!,29
Hark hark! I hear,29
Cry Cock-a-diddle-dow.,29
It sounds no more: and sure it waits upon,29
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,29
Allaying both their fury and my passion,29
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.,29
ARIEL sings,29
Of his bones are coral made;,29
Nothing of him that doth fade,29
Into something rich and strange.,29
Burthen Ding-dong,29
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.,29
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.,29
And say what thou seest yond.,29
Lord how it looks about! Believe me sir,29
No wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses,29
Was in the wreck; and but he's something stain'd,29
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows,29
I might call him,29
I ever saw so noble.,29
As my soul prompts it. Spirit fine spirit! I'll free thee,29
Most sure the goddess,29
May know if you remain upon this island;,29
How I may bear me here: my prime request,29
If you be maid or no?,29
But certainly a maid.,29
I am the best of them that speak this speech,29
How? the best?,29
A single thing as I am now that wonders,29
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,29
The king my father wreck'd.,29
Yes faith and all his lords; the Duke of Milan,29
[Aside] The Duke of Milan,29
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight,29
I'll set thee free for this.,29
A word good sir;,29
Why speaks my father so ungently? This,29
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father,29
O if a virgin,29
The queen of Naples.,29
Aside,29
I must uneasy make lest too light winning,29
To FERDINAND,29
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp,29
Upon this island as a spy to win it,29
No as I am a man.,29
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,29
Follow me.,29
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:,29
The fresh-brook muscles wither'd roots and husks,29
No;,29
Mine enemy has more power.,29
O dear father,29
He's gentle and not fearful.,29
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up traitor;,29
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,29
And make thy weapon drop.,29
Hence! hang not on my garments.,29
I'll be his surety.,29
Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee. What!,29
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,29
To the most of men this is a Caliban,29
My affections,29
To see a goodlier man.,29
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,29
So they are;,29
My father's loss the weakness which I feel,29
To whom I am subdued are but light to me,29
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth,29
Have I in such a prison.,29
To FERDINAND,29
Thou hast done well fine Ariel!,29
Follow me.,29
Hark what thou else shalt do me.,29
My father's of a better nature sir,29
Which now came from him.,29
As mountain winds: but then exactly do,29
To the syllable.,29
Exeunt,29
SCENE I. Another part of the island.,29
Beseech you sir be merry; you have cause,29
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe,29
The masters of some merchant and the merchant,29
I mean our preservation few in millions,29
Our sorrow with our comfort.,29
He receives comfort like cold porridge.,29
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;,29
Sir--,29
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,29
A dollar.,29
have spoken truer than you purposed.,29
Therefore my lord--,29
I prithee spare.,29
He will be talking.,29
wager first begins to crow?,29
The cockerel.,29
A laughter.,29
Though this island seem to be desert--,29
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible--,29
Yet--,29
It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate,29
Temperance was a delicate wench.,29
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.,29
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.,29
True; save means to live.,29
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!,29
With an eye of green in't.,29
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.,29
beyond credit--,29
That our garments being as they were drenched in,29
glosses being rather new-dyed than stained with,29
If but one of his pockets could speak would it not,29
Ay or very falsely pocket up his report,29
put them on first in Afric at the marriage of,29
Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return.,29
their queen.,29
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?,29
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,29
Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:,29
This Tunis sir was Carthage.,29
I assure you Carthage.,29
raised the wall and houses too.,29
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket,29
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring,29
Ay.,29
Sir we were talking that our garments seem now,29
of your daughter who is now queen.,29
Bate I beseech you widow Dido.,29
Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I,29
That sort was well fished for.,29
You cram these words into mine ears against,29
Married my daughter there! for coming thence,29
Who is so far from Italy removed,29
Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish,29
Sir he may live:,29
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,29
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head,29
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke,29
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt,29
No no he's gone.,29
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,29
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,29
Prithee peace.,29
By all of us and the fair soul herself,29
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your,29
I fear for ever: Milan and Naples have,29
Than we bring men to comfort them:,29
So is the dear'st o' the loss.,29
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,29
When you should bring the plaster.,29
And most chirurgeonly.,29
When you are cloudy.,29
Very foul.,29
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.,29
And were the king on't what would I do?,29
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries,29
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;,29
And use of service none; contract succession,29
No use of metal corn or wine or oil;,29
And women too but innocent and pure;,29
Yet he would be king on't.,29
beginning.,29
Without sweat or endeavour: treason felony,29
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,29
To feed my innocent people.,29
None man; all idle: whores and knaves.,29
To excel the golden age.,29
Long live Gonzalo!,29
Prithee no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.,29
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,29
they always use to laugh at nothing.,29
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing,29
nothing still.,29
An it had not fallen flat-long.,29
the moon out of her sphere if she would continue,29
Enter ARIEL invisible playing solemn music,29
Nay good my lord be not angry.,29
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh,29
Go sleep and hear us.,29
What all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes,29
They are inclined to do so.,29
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:,29
It is a comforter.,29
Will guard your person while you take your rest,29
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.,29
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!,29
Why,29
Myself disposed to sleep.,29
They fell together all as by consent;,29
Worthy Sebastian? O what might?--No more:--,29
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee and,29
Dropping upon thy head.,29
Do you not hear me speak?,29
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st,29
This is a strange repose to be asleep,29
And yet so fast asleep.,29
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die rather; wink'st,29
Thou dost snore distinctly;,29
I am more serious than my custom: you,29
Trebles thee o'er.,29
I'll teach you how to flow.,29
Hereditary sloth instructs me.,29
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish,29
You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,29
By their own fear or sloth.,29
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim,29
Which throes thee much to yield.,29
Although this lord of weak remembrance this,29
When he is earth'd hath here almost persuade--,29
Professes to persuade--the king his son's alive,29
And he that sleeps here swims.,29
That he's undrown'd.,29
What great hope have you! no hope that way is,29
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,29
That Ferdinand is drown'd?,29
Then tell me,29
Claribel.,29
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples,29
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins,29
We all were sea-swallow'd though some cast again,29
Whereof what's past is prologue what to come,29
What stuff is this! how say you?,29
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions,29
A space whose every cubit,29
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,29
That now hath seized them; why they were no worse,29
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate,29
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make,29
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this,29
Methinks I do.,29
Tender your own good fortune?,29
You did supplant your brother Prospero.,29
And look how well my garments sit upon me;,29
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.,29
Ay sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,29
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,29
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,29
If he were that which now he's like that's dead;,29
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you doing thus,29
This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who,29
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;,29
We say befits the hour.,29
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,29
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;,29
Draw together;,29
To fall it on Gonzalo.,29
They talk apart,29
My master through his art foresees the danger,29
For else his project dies--to keep them living.,29
While you here do snoring lie,29
His time doth take.,29
Shake off slumber and beware:,29
Then let us both be sudden.,29
Preserve the king.,29
Why how now? ho awake! Why are you drawn?,29
What's the matter?,29
Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing,29
It struck mine ear most terribly.,29
O 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,29
Of a whole herd of lions.,29
Upon mine honour sir I heard a humming,29
I shaked you sir and cried: as mine eyes open'd,29
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,29
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search,29
Heavens keep him from these beasts!,29
Lead away.,29
So king go safely on to seek thy son.,29
SCENE II. Another part of the island.,29
All the infections that the sun sucks up,29
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,29
Fright me with urchin--shows pitch me i' the mire,29
Out of my way unless he bid 'em; but,29
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,29
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount,29
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues,29
Enter TRINCULO,29
Here comes a spirit of his and to torment me,29
Perchance he will not mind me.,29
any weather at all and another storm brewing;,29
cloud yond huge one looks like a foul,29
should thunder as it did before I know not,29
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we,29
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-,29
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,29
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece,29
man; any strange beast there makes a man:,29
beggar they will lazy out ten to see a dead,29
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose,29
but an islander that hath lately suffered by a,29
Thunder,29
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other,29
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the,29
Enter STEPHANO singing: a bottle in his hand,29
Here shall I die ashore--,29
funeral: well here's my comfort.,29
Sings,29
The gunner and his mate,29
But none of us cared for Kate;,29
Would cry to a sailor Go hang!,29
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:,29
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.,29
Do not torment me: Oh!,29
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind ha? I,29
four legs; for it hath been said As proper a man as,29
and it shall be said so again while Stephano,29
The spirit torments me; Oh!,29
hath got as I take it an ague. Where the devil,29
relief if it be but for that. if I can recover him,29
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.,29
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the,29
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his,29
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that,29
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon I,29
Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that,29
mouth; this will shake your shaking I can tell you,29
open your chaps again.,29
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!,29
His forward voice now is to speak well of his,29
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will,29
will pour some in thy other mouth.,29
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy mercy! This is,29
long spoon.,29
speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy,29
If thou beest Trinculo come forth: I'll pull thee,29
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How,29
he vent Trinculos?,29
art thou not drowned Stephano? I hope now thou art,29
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of,29
Stephano two Neapolitans 'scaped!,29
[Aside]  These be fine things an if they be,29
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.,29
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?,29
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors,29
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was,29
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;,29
Here; swear then how thou escapedst.,29
duck I'll be sworn.,29
duck thou art made like a goose.,29
The whole butt man: my cellar is in a rock by the,29
how does thine ague?,29
Out o' the moon I do assure thee: I was the man i',29
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:,29
Come swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish,29
By this good light this is a very shallow monster!,29
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well,29
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;,29
By this light a most perfidious and drunken,29
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.,29
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed,29
heart to beat him--,29
But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!,29
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.,29
I'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee,29
A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a,29
I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;,29
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how,29
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee,29
I prithee now lead the way without any more,29
else being drowned we will inherit here: here;,29
and by again.,29
Farewell master; farewell farewell!,29
No more dams I'll make for fish,29
At requiring;,29
Ban 'Ban Cacaliban,29
Freedom hey-day! hey-day freedom! freedom,29
O brave monster! Lead the way.,29
ACT III,29
Enter FERDINAND bearing a log,29
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness,29
Point to rich ends. This my mean task,29
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,29
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,29
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,29
Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness,29
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,29
Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance unseen,29
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had,29
Pray set it down and rest you: when this burns,29
Is hard at study; pray now rest yourself;,29
O most dear mistress,29
What I must strive to do.,29
I'll bear your logs the while: pray give me that;,29
No precious creature;,29
Than you should such dishonour undergo,29
It would become me,29
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,29
Poor worm thou art infected!,29
You look wearily.,29
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--,29
What is your name?,29
I have broke your hest to say so!,29
Indeed the top of admiration! worth,29
I have eyed with best regard and many a time,29
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues,29
With so fun soul but some defect in her,29
And put it to the foil: but you O you,29
Of every creature's best!,29
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,29
More that I may call men than you good friend,29
I am skilless of; but by my modesty,29
Any companion in the world but you,29
Besides yourself to like of. But I prattle,29
I therein do forget.,29
A prince Miranda; I do think a king;,29
This wooden slavery than to suffer,29
The very instant that I saw you did,29
To make me slave to it; and for your sake,29
Do you love me?,29
And crown what I profess with kind event,29
What best is boded me to mischief! I,29
Do love prize honour you.,29
To weep at what I am glad of.,29
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace,29
Wherefore weep you?,29
What I desire to give and much less take,29
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,29
And prompt me plain and holy innocence!,29
If not I'll die your maid: to be your fellow,29
Whether you will or no.,29
And I thus humble ever.,29
Ay with a heart as willing,29
And mine with my heart in't; and now farewell,29
A thousand thousand!,29
So glad of this as they I cannot be,29
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,29
Much business appertaining.,29
SCENE II. Another part of the island.,29
Tell not me; when the butt is out we will drink,29
board 'em. Servant-monster drink to me.,29
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three,29
state totters.,29
are almost set in thy head.,29
monster indeed if they were set in his tail.,29
for my part the sea cannot drown me; I swam ere I,29
and on. By this light thou shalt be my lieutenant,29
Your lieutenant if you list; he's no standard.,29
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say,29
Moon-calf speak once in thy life if thou beest a,29
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.,29
Thou liest most ignorant monster: I am in case to,29
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much,29
being but half a fish and half a monster?,29
Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!,29
Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head: if you,29
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.,29
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?,29
and so shall Trinculo.,29
As I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant a,29
Thou liest.,29
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.,29
this hand I will supplant some of your teeth.,29
Mum then and no more. Proceed.,29
From me he got it. if thy greatness will,29
But this thing dare not--,29
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.,29
Canst thou bring me to the party?,29
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.,29
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!,29
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone,29
Where the quick freshes are.,29
interrupt the monster one word further and,29
and make a stock-fish of thee.,29
off.,29
Thou liest.,29
Beats TRINCULO,29
I did not give the lie. Out o' your,29
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on,29
Ha ha ha!,29
off.,29
I'll beat him too.,29
Why as I told thee 'tis a custom with him,29
Having first seized his books or with a log,29
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember,29
He's but a sot as I am nor hath not,29
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.,29
Which when he has a house he'll deck withal,29
The beauty of his daughter; he himself,29
But only Sycorax my dam and she;,29
As great'st does least.,29
Ay lord; she will become thy bed I warrant.,29
Monster I will kill this man: his daughter and I,29
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou,29
Excellent.,29
while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head.,29
Wilt thou destroy him then?,29
This will I tell my master.,29
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch,29
At thy request monster I will do reason any,29
Sings,29
And scout 'em and flout 'em,29
That's not the tune.,29
What is this same?,29
of Nobody.,29
if thou beest a devil take't as thou list.,29
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!,29
No monster not I.,29
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.,29
Will hum about mine ears and sometime voices,29
Will make me sleep again: and then in dreaming,29
Ready to drop upon me that when I waked,29
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall,29
When Prospero is destroyed.,29
The sound is going away; let's follow it and,29
Lead monster; we'll follow. I would I could see,29
Wilt come? I'll follow Stephano.,29
SCENE III. Another part of the island.,29
By'r lakin I can go no further sir;,29
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,29
Old lord I cannot blame thee,29
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down and rest.,29
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd,29
Our frustrate search on land. Well let him go.,29
out of hope.,29
That you resolved to effect.,29
Will we take throughly.,29
For now they are oppress'd with travel they,29
As when they are fresh.,29
Solemn and strange music,29
Marvellous sweet music!,29
Give us kind keepers heavens! What were these?,29
That there are unicorns that in Arabia,29
At this hour reigning there.,29
And what does else want credit come to me,29
lie,29
If in Naples,29
If I should say I saw such islanders--,29
Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note,29
Our human generation you shall find,29
[Aside]              Honest lord,29
Are worse than devils.,29
Such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing,29
Of excellent dumb discourse.,29
They vanish'd strangely.,29
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.,29
Not I.,29
Who would believe that there were mountaineers,29
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men,29
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us,29
I will stand to and feed,29
The best is past. Brother my lord the duke,29
Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL like a  harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and with a quaint device the banquet vanishes,29
That hath to instrument this lower world,29
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island,29
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;,29
Their proper selves.,29
You fools! I and my fellows,29
Of whom your swords are temper'd may as well,29
Kill the still-closing waters as diminish,29
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,29
And will not be uplifted. But remember--,29
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;,29
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed,29
Incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures,29
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:,29
Can be at once shall step by step attend,29
Which here in this most desolate isle else falls,29
And a clear life ensuing.,29
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou,29
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated,29
And observation strange my meaner ministers,29
And these mine enemies are all knit up,29
And in these fits I leave them while I visit,29
And his and mine loved darling.,29
I' the name of something holy sir why stand you,29
O it is monstrous monstrous:,29
The winds did sing it to me and the thunder,29
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.,29
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded,29
Exit,29
I'll fight their legions o'er.,29
Exeunt SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO,29
Like poison given to work a great time after,29
That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly,29
May now provoke them to.,29
Exeunt,29
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.,29
If I have too austerely punish'd you,29
Have given you here a third of mine own life,29
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations,29
Hast strangely stood the test here afore Heaven,29
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,29
And make it halt behind her.,29
Against an oracle.,29
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but,29
All sanctimonious ceremonies may,29
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall,29
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew,29
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,29
As I hope,29
With such love as 'tis now the murkiest den,29
Our worser genius can shall never melt,29
The edge of that day's celebration,29
Or Night kept chain'd below.,29
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.,29
Enter ARIEL,29
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service,29
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,29
Incite them to quick motion; for I must,29
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,29
Presently?,29
Before you can say 'come' and 'go',29
Each one tripping on his toe,29
Do you love me master? no?,29
Till thou dost hear me call.,29
Exit,29
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw,29
Or else good night your vow!,29
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart,29
Well.,29
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!,29
Soft music,29
Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas,29
Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep,29
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,29
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,29
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;,29
Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,29
Bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace,29
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:,29
Enter CERES,29
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;,29
Diffusest honey-drops refreshing showers,29
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,29
Summon'd me hither to this short-grass'd green?,29
And some donation freely to estate,29
Tell me heavenly bow,29
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot,29
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company,29
Of her society,29
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son,29
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,29
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;,29
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,29
And be a boy right out.,29
Great Juno comes; I know her by her gait.,29
How does my bounteous sister? Go with me,29
And honour'd in their issue.,29
Honour riches marriage-blessing,29
Hourly joys be still upon you!,29
Earth's increase foison plenty,29
Vines and clustering bunches growing,29
Spring come to you at the farthest,29
Scarcity and want shall shun you;,29
This is a most majestic vision and,29
To think these spirits?,29
I have from their confines call'd to enact,29
Let me live here ever;,29
Makes this place Paradise.,29
Sweet now silence!,29
There's something else to do: hush and be mute,29
You nymphs call'd Naiads of the windring brooks,29
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land,29
Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate,29
Enter certain Nymphs,29
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:,29
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one,29
Enter certain Reapers properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly and speaks; after which to a  strange hollow and confused noise they heavily vanish,29
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates,29
Is almost come.,29
Well done! avoid; no more!,29
That works him strongly.,29
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.,29
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful sir.,29
As I foretold you were all spirits and,29
And like the baseless fabric of this vision,29
The solemn temples the great globe itself,29
And like this insubstantial pageant faded,29
As dreams are made on and our little life,29
Bear with my weakness; my brain is troubled:,29
If you be pleased retire into my cell,29
To still my beating mind.,29
Exeunt,29
Enter ARIEL,29
Spirit,29
Ay my commander: when I presented Ceres,29
Lest I might anger thee.,29
I told you sir they were red-hot with drinking;,29
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground,29
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;,29
their ears,29
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears,29
Tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns,29
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,29
O'erstunk their feet.,29
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:,29
For stale to catch these thieves.,29
Exit,29
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,29
And as with age his body uglier grows,29
Even to roaring.,29
Come hang them on this line.,29
Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not,29
Monster your fairy which you say is,29
played the Jack with us.,29
which my nose is in great indignation.,29
a displeasure against you look you--,29
Good my lord give me thy favour still.,29
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.,29
Ay but to lose our bottles in the pool--,29
monster but an infinite loss.,29
harmless fairy monster.,29
for my labour.,29
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise and enter.,29
Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban,29
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.,29
what a wardrobe here is for thee!,29
O ho monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.,29
Put off that gown Trinculo; by this hand I'll have,29
Thy grace shall have it.,29
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone,29
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,29
Be you quiet monster. Mistress line,29
the line: now jerkin you are like to lose your,29
Do do: we steal by line and level an't like your grace.,29
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this,29
pass of pate; there's another garment for't.,29
away with the rest.,29
And all be turn'd to barnacles or to apes,29
Monster lay-to your fingers: help to bear this,29
out of my kingdom: go to carry this.,29
Ay and this.,29
Hey Mountain hey!,29
Fury Fury! there Tyrant there! hark! hark!,29
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints,29
With aged cramps and more pinch-spotted make them,29
Hark they roar!,29
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:,29
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little,29
Exeunt,29
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.,29
Now does my project gather to a head:,29
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?,29
You said our work should cease.,29
When first I raised the tempest. Say my spirit,29
Confined together,29
Just as you left them; all prisoners sir,29
They cannot budge till your release. The king,29
And the remainder mourning over them,29
Him that you term'd sir 'The good old lord Gonzalo;',29
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em,29
Would become tender.,29
Mine would sir were I human.,29
Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling,29
One of their kind that relish all as sharply,29
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,29
Do I take part: the rarer action is,29
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend,29
My charms I'll break their senses I'll restore,29
I'll fetch them sir.,29
Ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves,29
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him,29
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,29
Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice,29
Weak masters though ye be I have bedimm'd,29
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault,29
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak,29
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up,29
Have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth,29
I here abjure and when I have required,29
To work mine end upon their senses that,29
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,29
I'll drown my book.,29
Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO with a  frantic gesture attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing speaks:,29
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,29
For you are spell-stopp'd.,29
Mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine,29
And as the morning steals upon the night,29
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle,29
My true preserver and a loyal sir,29
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly,29
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.,29
You brother mine that entertain'd ambition,29
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,29
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding,29
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore,29
That yet looks on me or would know me Ariel,29
I will discase me and myself present,29
Thou shalt ere long be free.,29
Where the bee sucks. there suck I:,29
There I couch when owls do cry.,29
After summer merrily.,29
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.,29
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so so so.,29
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep,29
Being awake enforce them to this place,29
I drink the air before me and return,29
Exit,29
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us,29
Behold sir king,29
For more assurance that a living prince,29
And to thee and thy company I bid,29
Whether thou best he or no,29
As late I have been I not know: thy pulse,29
The affliction of my mind amends with which,29
An if this be at all a most strange story.,29
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero,29
First noble friend,29
Be measured or confined.,29
Or be not I'll not swear.,29
Some subtilties o' the isle that will not let you,29
Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO,29
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you,29
I will tell no tales.,29
No.,29
Would even infect my mouth I do forgive,29
My dukedom of thee which perforce I know,29
If thou be'st Prospero,29
How thou hast met us here who three hours since,29
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--,29
I am woe for't sir.,29
Says it is past her cure.,29
You have not sought her help of whose soft grace,29
And rest myself content.,29
As great to me as late; and supportable,29
Than you may call to comfort you for I,29
A daughter?,29
The king and queen there! that they were I wish,29
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?,29
At this encounter do so much admire,29
Their eyes do offices of truth their words,29
Been justled from your senses know for certain,29
Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely,29
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;,29
Not a relation for a breakfast nor,29
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants,29
My dukedom since you have given me again,29
At least bring forth a wonder to content ye,29
Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess,29
No my dear'st love,29
Yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,29
If this prove,29
Shall I twice lose.,29
Though the seas threaten they are merciful;,29
Kneels,29
Of a glad father compass thee about!,29
O wonder!,29
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,29
Tis new to thee.,29
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:,29
And brought us thus together?,29
But by immortal Providence she's mine:,29
For his advice nor thought I had one. She,29
Of whom so often I have heard renown,29
Received a second life; and second father,29
I am hers:,29
Must ask my child forgiveness!,29
Let us not burthen our remembrance with,29
I have inly wept,29
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!,29
Which brought us hither.,29
Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue,29
Beyond a common joy and set it down,29
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,29
Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom,29
When no man was his own.,29
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart,29
Be it so! Amen!,29
O look sir look sir! here is more of us:,29
This fellow could not drown. Now blasphemy,29
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?,29
Our king and company; the next our ship--,29
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when,29
[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir all this service,29
[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!,29
From strange to stranger. Say how came you hither?,29
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,29
Where but even now with strange and several noises,29
And more diversity of sounds all horrible,29
Where we in all her trim freshly beheld,29
Capering to eye her: on a trice so please you,29
And were brought moping hither.,29
[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely my diligence. Thou shalt be free.,29
And there is in this business more than nature,29
Must rectify our knowledge.,29
Do not infest your mind with beating on,29
Which shall be shortly single I'll resolve you,29
These happen'd accidents; till when be cheerful,29
Aside to ARIEL,29
Set Caliban and his companions free;,29
Exit ARIEL,29
There are yet missing of your company,29
Re-enter ARIEL driving in CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO in their stolen apparel,29
let no man take care for himself; for all is,29
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,29
O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed!,29
He will chastise me.,29
What things are these my lord Antonio?,29
Very like; one of them,29
Mark but the badges of these men my lords,29
His mother was a witch and one so strong,29
And deal in her command without her power.,29
For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them,29
Must know and own; this thing of darkness!,29
I shall be pinch'd to death.,29
He is drunk now: where had he wine?,29
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?,29
I have been in such a pickle since I,29
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.,29
O touch me not; I am not Stephano but a cramp.,29
I should have been a sore one then.,29
Pointing to Caliban,29
As in his shape. Go sirrah to my cell;,29
To have my pardon trim it handsomely.,29
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass,29
And worship this dull fool!,29
Hence and bestow your luggage where you found it.,29
Exeunt CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO,29
To my poor cell where you shall take your rest,29
With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it,29
And the particular accidents gone by,29
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,29
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;,29
Every third thought shall be my grave.,29
To hear the story of your life which must,29
I'll deliver all;,29
And sail so expeditious that shall catch,29
Aside to ARIEL,29
That is thy charge: then to the elements,29
Exeunt,29
SPOKEN BY PROSPERO,29
And what strength I have's mine own,29
I must be here confined by you,29
Since I have my dukedom got,29
In this bare island by your spell;,29
With the help of your good hands:,29
Must fill or else my project fails,29
Spirits to enforce art to enchant,29
Unless I be relieved by prayer,29
Mercy itself and frees all faults.,29
Let your indulgence set me free.,29
SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.,30
Good day sir.,30
I have not seen you long: how goes the world?,30
Ay that's well known:,30
Which manifold record not matches? See,30
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.,30
O 'tis a worthy lord.,30
A most incomparable man breathed as it were,30
He passes.,30
O pray let's see't: for the Lord Timon sir?,30
[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have,30
It stains the glory in that happy verse,30
Tis a good form.,30
And rich: here is a water look ye.,30
To the great lord.,30
Our poesy is as a gum which oozes,30
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame,30
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?,30
Upon the heels of my presentment sir.,30
Tis a good piece.,30
Indifferent.,30
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power,30
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture,30
It is a pretty mocking of the life.,30
I will say of it,30
Lives in these touches livelier than life.,30
How this lord is follow'd!,30
Look more!,30
of visitors.,30
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug,30
Halts not particularly but moves itself,30
Infects one comma in the course I hold;,30
Leaving no tract behind.,30
I will unbolt to you.,30
As well of glib and slippery creatures as,30
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune,30
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance,30
To Apemantus that few things loves better,30
The knee before him and returns in peace,30
I saw them speak together.,30
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount,30
That labour on the bosom of this sphere,30
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,30
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;,30
Translates his rivals.,30
This throne this Fortune and this hill methinks,30
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount,30
In our condition.,30
All those which were his fellows but of late,30
Follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance,30
Make sacred even his stirrup and through him,30
Ay marry what of these?,30
Spurns down her late beloved all his dependants,30
Even on their knees and hands let him slip down,30
Tis common:,30
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's,30
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen,30
Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON addressing himself  courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other servants following,30
Ay my good lord: five talents is his debt,30
Your honourable letter he desires,30
Periods his comfort.,30
I am not of that feather to shake off,30
A gentleman that well deserves a help:,30
and free him.,30
Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;,30
Tis not enough to help the feeble up,30
All happiness to your honour!,30
Enter an old Athenian,30
Freely good father.,30
I have so: what of him?,30
Attends he here or no? Lucilius!,30
This fellow here Lord Timon this thy creature,30
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;,30
Than one which holds a trencher.,30
One only daughter have I no kin else,30
The maid is fair o' the youngest for a bride,30
In qualities of the best. This man of thine,30
Join with me to forbid him her resort;,30
The man is honest.,30
His honesty rewards him in itself;,30
Does she love him?,30
Our own precedent passions do instruct us,30
[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?,30
If in her marriage my consent be missing,30
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,30
How shall she be endow'd,30
Three talents on the present; in future all.,30
To build his fortune I will strain a little,30
What you bestow in him I'll counterpoise,30
Most noble lord,30
My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.,30
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,30
Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian,30
I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:,30
A piece of painting which I do beseech,30
Painting is welcome.,30
or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,30
Even such as they give out. I like your work;,30
Till you hear further from me.,30
Well fare you gentleman: give me your hand;,30
Hath suffer'd under praise.,30
A more satiety of commendations.,30
It would unclew me quite.,30
As those which sell would give: but you well know,30
Are prized by their masters: believe't dear lord,30
Well mock'd.,30
Which all men speak with him.,30
Enter APEMANTUS,30
He'll spare none.,30
Till I be gentle stay thou for thy good morrow;,30
Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.,30
Yes.,30
Jeweller: You know me Apemantus?,30
Thou art proud Apemantus.,30
Whither art going?,30
That's a deed thou'lt die for.,30
How likest thou this picture Apemantus?,30
Wrought he not well that painted it?,30
he's but a filthy piece of work.,30
Thy mother's of my generation: what's she if I be a dog?,30
No; I eat not lords.,30
O they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.,30
So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.,30
Not so well as plain-dealing which will not cost a,30
What dost thou think 'tis worth?,30
How now philosopher!,30
Art not one?,30
Then I lie not.,30
Yes.,30
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.,30
Yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy,30
the flatterer. Heavens that I were a lord!,30
E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.,30
Ay.,30
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.,30
Ay Apemantus.,30
If traffic do it the gods do it.,30
Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger,30
Tis Alcibiades and some twenty horse,30
Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.,30
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence,30
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.,30
Most welcome sir!,30
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!,30
sweet knaves,30
Into baboon and monkey.,30
Most hungerly on your sight.,30
Ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time,30
Exeunt all except APEMANTUS,30
What time o' day is't Apemantus?,30
That time serves still.,30
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?,30
Fare thee well fare thee well.,30
Why Apemantus?,30
give thee none.,30
No I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy,30
Away unpeaceable dog or I'll spurn thee hence!,30
Exit,30
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes,30
He pours it out; Plutus the god of gold,30
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,30
All use of quittance.,30
That ever govern'd man.,30
I'll keep you company.,30
SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.,30
Most honour'd Timon,30
And call him to long peace.,30
Then as in grateful virtue I am bound,30
Doubled with thanks and service from whose help,30
O by no means,30
I gave it freely ever; and there's none,30
If our betters play at that game we must not dare,30
A noble spirit!,30
They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON,30
To set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes,30
But where there is true friendship there needs none.,30
Than my fortunes to me.,30
My lord we always have confess'd it.,30
O Apemantus you are welcome.,30
You shall not make me welcome:,30
Fie thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there,30
They say my lords 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond,30
himself for he does neither affect company nor is,30
Let me stay at thine apperil Timon: I come to,30
I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,30
prithee let my meat make thee silent.,30
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods what a number of,30
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;,30
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:,30
Good for their meat and safer for their lives.,30
next him now parts bread with him pledges the,30
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a,30
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:,30
My lord in heart; and let the health go round.,30
Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides,30
look ill Timon. Here's that which is too weak to,30
This and my food are equals; there's no odds:,30
Apemantus' grace.,30
I pray for no man but myself:,30
To trust man on his oath or bond;,30
Or a dog that seems a-sleeping:,30
Or my friends if I should need 'em.,30
Rich men sin and I eat root.,30
Much good dich thy good heart Apemantus!,30
My heart is ever at your service my lord.,30
dinner of friends.,30
like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.,30
that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!,30
would once use our hearts whereby we might express,30
for ever perfect.,30
themselves have provided that I shall have much help,30
have you that charitable title from thousands did,30
more of you to myself than you can with modesty,30
you. O you gods think I what need we have any,30
were the most needless creatures living should we,30
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their,30
myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We,30
properer can we can our own than the riches of our,30
so many like brothers commanding one another's,30
Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks: to,30
Thou weepest to make them drink Timon.,30
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.,30
I promise you my lord you moved me much.,30
Tucket within,30
Enter a Servant,30
Please you my lord there are certain,30
Ladies! what are their wills?,30
bears that office to signify their pleasures.,30
Enter Cupid,30
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses,30
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,30
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.,30
Music make their welcome!,30
You see my lord how ample you're beloved.,30
Hoy-day what a sweep of vanity comes this way!,30
Like madness is the glory of this life.,30
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;,30
Upon whose age we void it up again,30
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?,30
Of their friends' gift?,30
Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;,30
The Lords rise from table with much adoring of  TIMON; and to show their loves each singles out an  Amazon and all dance men with women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and cease,30
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,30
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,30
I am to thank you for 't.,30
Faith for the worst is filthy; and would not hold,30
Ladies there is an idle banquet attends you:,30
Most thankfully my lord.,30
Flavius.,30
The little casket bring me hither.,30
There is no crossing him in 's humour;,30
Else I should tell him--well i' faith I should,30
Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,30
Exit,30
Here my lord in readiness.,30
Re-enter FLAVIUS with the casket,30
I have one word to say to you: look you my good lord,30
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,30
I am so far already in your gifts--,30
Enter a Servant,30
Newly alighted and come to visit you.,30
I beseech your honour,30
Near! why then another time I'll hear thee:,30
entertainment.,30
Enter a Second Servant,30
Out of his free love hath presented to you,30
I shall accept them fairly; let the presents,30
Enter a third Servant,30
Please you my lord that honourable,30
to-morrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour,30
I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,30
[Aside]                What will this come to?,30
And all out of an empty coffer:,30
To show him what a beggar his heart is,30
His promises fly so beyond his state,30
For every word: he is so kind that he now,30
Well would I were gently put out of office,30
Happier is he that has no friend to feed,30
I bleed inwardly for my lord.,30
You do yourselves,30
Here my lord a trifle of our love.,30
O he's the very soul of bounty!,30
Good words the other day of a bay courser,30
O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that.,30
Can justly praise but what he does affect:,30
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.,30
I take all and your several visitations,30
Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends,30
Thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich;,30
Is 'mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast,30
Ay defiled land my lord.,30
And so,30
So infinitely endear'd--,30
The best of happiness,30
Ready for his friends.,30
What a coil's here!,30
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums,30
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs,30
Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be,30
No I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,30
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,30
paper shortly: what need these feasts pomps and,30
Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am,30
with better music.,30
So:,30
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.,30
To counsel deaf but not to flattery!,30
ACT II,30
Enter Senator with papers in his hand,30
He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,30
Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.,30
And give it Timon why the dog coins gold.,30
Better than he why give my horse to Timon,30
And able horses. No porter at his gate,30
All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason,30
Caphis I say!,30
Here sir; what is your pleasure?,30
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased,30
Commend me to your master'--and the cap,30
My uses cry to me I must serve my turn,30
And my reliances on his fracted dates,30
But must not break my back to heal his finger;,30
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,30
Put on a most importunate aspect,30
When every feather sticks in his own wing,30
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.,30
I go sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,30
I will sir.,30
Exeunt,30
Enter FLAVIUS with many bills in his hand,30
That he will neither know how to maintain it,30
How things go from him nor resumes no care,30
Was to be so unwise to be so kind.,30
I must be round with him now he comes from hunting.,30
Enter CAPHIS and the Servants of Isidore and Varro,30
You come for money?,30
It is: and yours too Isidore?,30
Would we were all discharged!,30
Here comes the lord.,30
So soon as dinner's done we'll forth again,30
My lord here is a note of certain dues.,30
Of Athens here my lord.,30
Please it your lordship he hath put me off,30
My master is awaked by great occasion,30
That with your other noble parts you'll suit,30
Mine honest friend,30
Nay good my lord--,30
Varro's Servant One Varro's servant my good lord--,30
He humbly prays your speedy payment.,30
Varro's Servant 'Twas due on forfeiture my lord six weeks And past.,30
And I am sent expressly to your lordship.,30
I do beseech you good my lords keep on;,30
Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords,30
Come hither: pray you,30
With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,30
Against my honour?,30
The time is unagreeable to this business:,30
That I may make his lordship understand,30
Do so my friends. See them well entertain'd.,30
Pray draw near.,30
Enter APEMANTUS and Fool,30
let's ha' some sport with 'em.,30
Isidore's Servant A plague upon him dog!,30
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?,30
No'tis to thyself.,30
Come away.,30
No thou stand'st single thou'rt not on him yet.,30
He last asked the question. Poor rogues and,30
What are we Apemantus?,30
Why?,30
yourselves. Speak to 'em fool.,30
Gramercies good fool: how does your mistress?,30
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!,30
Enter Page,30
[To the Fool]  Why how now captain! what do you,30
Would I had a rod in my mouth that I might answer,30
Prithee Apemantus read me the superscription of,30
Canst not read?,30
There will little learning die then that day thou,30
Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard and thou't,30
Thou wast whelped a dog and thou shalt famish a,30
Exit,30
you to Lord Timon's.,30
If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?,30
So would I--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.,30
Ay fool.,30
mistress is one and I am her fool. When men come,30
go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house,30
Varro's Servant I could render one.,30
and a knave; which not-withstanding thou shalt be,30
Varro's Servant What is a whoremaster fool?,30
Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;,30
with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is,30
shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore,30
Varro's Servant Thou art not altogether a fool.,30
I have so much wit thou lackest.,30
Aside aside; here comes Lord Timon.,30
Come with me fool come.,30
woman; sometime the philosopher.,30
Pray you walk near: I'll speak with you anon.,30
You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time,30
That I might so have rated my expense,30
You would not hear me,30
Go to:,30
When my indispos ition put you back:,30
Thus to excuse yourself.,30
At many times I brought in my accounts,30
And say you found them in mine honesty.,30
Return so much I have shook my head and wept;,30
To hold your hand more close: I did endure,30
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate,30
Though you hear now too late--yet now's a time--,30
To pay your present debts.,30
Tis all engaged some forfeited and gone;,30
Of present dues: the future comes apace:,30
How goes our reckoning?,30
O my good lord the world is but a word:,30
How quickly were it gone!,30
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,30
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,30
With riotous feeders when our vaults have wept,30
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,30
And set mine eyes at flow.,30
Heavens have I said the bounty of this lord!,30
This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?,30
Lord Timon's?,30
Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise,30
Feast-won fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,30
Come sermon me no further:,30
Unwisely not ignobly have I given.,30
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;,30
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,30
As I can bid thee speak.,30
And in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd,30
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you,30
Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!,30
My lord? my lord?,30
to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour,30
loves and I am proud say that my occasions have,30
the request be fifty talents.,30
[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!,30
Of whom even to the state's best health I have,30
A thousand talents to me.,30
For that I knew it the most general way--,30
But they do shake their heads and I am here,30
Is't true? can't be?,30
That now they are at fall want treasure cannot,30
But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--,30
May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--,30
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,30
They froze me into silence.,30
Prithee man look cheerly. These old fellows,30
Their blood is caked 'tis cold it seldom flows;,30
And nature as it grows again toward earth,30
To a Servant,30
To FLAVIUS,30
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.,30
To Servant,30
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd,30
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,30
Bid him suppose some good necessity,30
With those five talents.,30
To FLAVIUS,30
To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak or think,30
I would I could not think it: that thought is,30
Being free itself it thinks all others so.,30
ACT III,30
FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him,30
I thank you sir.,30
Here's my lord.,30
warrant. Why this hits right; I dreamt of a silver,30
Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome sir.,30
Exit Servants,30

His health is well sir.,30
what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius?,30
lord's behalf I come to entreat your honour to,30
use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to,30
assistance therein.,30
good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis if he would not,30
dined with him and told him on't and come again to,30
and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning,30
is his: I ha' told him on't but I could ne'er get,30
Re-enter Servant with wine,30
Flaminius I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.,30
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt,30
belongs to reason; and canst use the time well if,30
To Servant,30
Exit Servant,30
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou,30
that this is no time to lend money especially upon,30
solidares for thee: good boy wink at me and say,30
Is't possible the world should so much differ,30
To him that worships thee!,30
Ha! now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master.,30
May these add to the number that may scald thee!,30
Thou disease of a friend and not himself!,30
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,30
Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him:,30
When he is turn'd to poison?,30
And when he's sick to death let not that part of nature,30
To expel sickness but prolong his hour!,30
SCENE II. A public place.,30
Who the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend and,30
We know him for no less though we are but strangers,30
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's,30
shrinks from him.,30
But believe you this my lord that not long ago,30
so many talents nay urged extremely for't and,30
How!,30
What a strange case was that! now before the gods,30
there was very little honour showed in't. For my own,30
small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels,30
yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should,30
Enter SERVILIUS,30
I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord--,30
Servilius! you are kindly met sir. Fare thee well:,30
exquisite friend.,30
Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to,30
him thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?,30
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use,30
I know his lordship is but merry with me;,30
But in the mean time he wants less my lord.,30
I should not urge it half so faithfully.,30
Upon my soul'tis true sir.,30
against such a good time when I might ha' shown,30
should purchase the day before for a little part,30
before the gods I am not able to do--the more,30
myself these gentlemen can witness! but I would,30
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I,30
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him,30
afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an,30
befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?,30
I'll look you out a good turn Servilius.,30
True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed;,30
Exit,30
Ay too well.,30
same piece,30
His friend that dips in the same dish? for in,30
And kept his credit with his purse,30
Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,30
And yet--O see the monstrousness of man,30
He does deny him in respect of his,30
Religion groans at it.,30
I never tasted Timon in my life,30
To mark me for his friend; yet I protest,30
And honourable carriage,30
I would have put my wealth into donation,30
So much I love his heart: but I perceive,30
For policy sits above conscience.,30
SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.,30
Must he needs trouble me in 't--hum!--'bove,30
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;,30
Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these,30
My lord,30
They have au denied him.,30
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?,30
It shows but little love or judgment in him:,30
physicians,30
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,30
But his occasion might have woo'd me first;,30
That e'er received gift from him:,30
That I'll requite its last? No:,30
To the rest and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.,30
Had sent to me first but for my mind's sake;,30
And with their faint reply this answer join;,30
Exit,30
devil knew not what he did when he made man,30
think but in the end the villainies of man will,30
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,30
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his,30
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,30
Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards,30
Now to guard sure their master.,30
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.,30
SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.,30
Varro's,30
The like to you kind Varro.,30
What do we meet together?,30
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.,30
Enter PHILOTUS,30
Good day at once.,30
What do you think the hour?,30
Lucilius' Servant So much?,30
Lucilius' Servant Not yet.,30
Lucilius' Servant Ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him:,30
Is like the sun's; but not like his recoverable.,30
That is one may reach deep enough and yet,30
I am of your fear for that.,30
Your lord sends now for money.,30
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,30
It is against my heart.,30
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:,30
And send for money for 'em.,30
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,30
Varro's,30
Lucilius' Servant Five thousand mine.,30
Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,30
Else surely his had equall'd.,30
One of Lord Timon's men.,30
come forth?,30
We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.,30
Exit,30
Lucilius' Servant Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?,30
Do you hear sir?,30
By your leave sir--,30
We wait for certain money here sir.,30
If money were as certain as your waiting,30
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,30
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts,30
gluttonous maws.,30
Let me pass quietly:,30
I have no more to reckon he to spend.,30
If 'twill not serve'tis not so base as you;,30
Exit,30
How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?,30
No matter what; he's poor and that's revenge,30
house to put his head in? such may rail against,30
Enter SERVILIUS,30
If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some,30
take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to,30
he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.,30
And if it be so far beyond his health,30
And make a clear way to the gods.,30
We cannot take this for answer sir.,30
Enter TIMON in a rage FLAMINIUS following,30
Have I been ever free and must my house,30
The place which I have feasted does it now,30
Lucilius' Servant Put in now Titus.,30
Lucilius' Servant Here's mine.,30
Both,30
All our bills.,30
Lucilius' Servant Alas my lord-,30
Mine fifty talents.,30
Lucilius' Servant Five thousand crowns my lord.,30
What yours?--and yours?,30
My lord--,30
My lord--,30
Exit,30
at their money: these debts may well be called,30
Exeunt,30
They have e'en put my breath from me the slaves.,30
My dear lord--,30
My lord--,30
Here my lord.,30
Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius:,30
I'll once more feast the rascals.,30
You only speak from your distracted soul;,30
A moderate table.,30
I charge thee invite them all: let in the tide,30
Exeunt,30
My lord you have my voice to it; the fault's,30
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.,30
Enter ALCIBIADES with Attendants,30
Now captain?,30
For pity is the virtue of the law,30
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy,30
Hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth,30
He is a man setting his fate aside,30
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--,30
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,30
He did oppose his foe:,30
He did behave his anger ere 'twas spent,30
You undergo too strict a paradox,30
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd,30
Upon the head of valour; which indeed,30
When sects and factions were newly born:,30
The worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs,30
carelessly,30
To bring it into danger.,30
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!,30
You cannot make gross sins look clear:,30
My lords then under favour pardon me,30
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,30
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,30
Such valour in the bearing what make we,30
That stay at home if bearing carry it,30
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,30
As you are great be pitifully good:,30
To kill I grant is sin's extremest gust;,30
To be in anger is impiety;,30
Weigh but the crime with this.,30
In vain! his service done,30
Were a sufficient briber for his life.,30
I say my lords he has done fair service,30
How full of valour did he bear himself,30
He has made too much plenty with 'em;,30
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner:,30
To overcome him: in that beastly fury,30
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,30
He dies.,30
My lords if not for any parts in him--,30
And be in debt to none--yet more to move you,30
And for I know your reverend ages love,30
My honours to you upon his good returns.,30
Why let the war receive 't in valiant gore,30
We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,30
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.,30
I do beseech you know me.,30
Call me to your remembrances.,30
I cannot think but your age has forgot me;,30
To sue and be denied such common grace:,30
Do you dare our anger?,30
We banish thee for ever.,30
Banish your dotage; banish usury,30
If after two days' shine Athens contain thee,30
our spirit,30
Exeunt Senators,30
Only in bone that none may look on you!,30
While they have told their money and let out,30
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?,30
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!,30
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,30
My discontented troops and lay for hearts.,30
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.,30
SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.,30
The good time of day to you sir.,30
did but try us this other day.,30
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as,30
It should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting.,30
inviting which many my near occasions did urge me,30
I must needs appear.,30
business but he would not hear my excuse. I am,30
provision was out.,30
things go.,30
you?,30
A thousand pieces!,30
He sent to me sir--Here he comes.,30
With all my heart gentlemen both; and how fare you?,30
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we,30
[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such,30
recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the,30
trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.,30
that I returned you an empty messenger.,30
My noble lord--,30
My most honourable lord I am e'en sick of shame,30
I was so unfortunate a beggar.,30
If you had sent but two hours before--,30
The banquet brought in,30
All covered dishes!,30
Doubt not that if money and the season can yield,30
How do you? What's the news?,30
Alcibiades banished!,30
How! how!,30
My worthy friends will you draw near?,30
This is the old man still.,30
It does: but time will--and so--,30
Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to,30
places alike. Make not a city feast of it to let,30
sit sit. The gods require our thanks.,30
thankfulness. For your own gifts make yourselves,30
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough that,30
godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the,30
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without,30
the table let a dozen of them be--as they are. The,30
together with the common lag of people--what is,30
destruction. For these my present friends as they,30
nothing are they welcome.,30
The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water,30
I know not.,30
You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water,30
Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries,30
Your reeking villany.,30
Live loathed and long,30
Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears,30
Cap and knee slaves vapours and minute-jacks!,30
Crust you quite o'er! What dost thou go?,30
Stay I will lend thee money borrow none.,30
What all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,30
Burn house! sink Athens! henceforth hated be,30
Exit,30
How now my lords!,30
Push! did you see my cap?,30
He's but a mad lord and nought but humour sways him.,30
beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?,30
Here 'tis.,30
Let's make no stay.,30
I feel 't upon my bones.,30
Exeunt,30
SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.,30
Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,30
And fence not Athens! Matrons turn incontinent!,30
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,30
Convert o' the instant green virginity,30
Rather than render back out with your knives,30
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,30
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,30
With it beat out his brains! Piety and fear,30
Domestic awe night-rest and neighbourhood,30
Degrees observances customs and laws,30
And let confusion live! Plagues incident to men,30
On Athens ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,30
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty,30
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,30
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop,30
at their society as their friendship may,30
But nakedness thou detestable town!,30
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find,30
The gods confound--hear me you good gods all--,30
And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow,30
Exit,30
Enter FLAVIUS with two or three Servants,30
Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?,30
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,30
Such a house broke!,30
One friend to take his fortune by the arm,30
As we do turn our backs,30
So his familiars to his buried fortunes,30
Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,30
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,30
Enter other Servants,30
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;,30
Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,30
Hearing the surges threat: we must all part,30
Good fellows all,30
Wherever we shall meet for Timon's sake,30
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,30
Nay put out all your hands. Not one word more:,30
Servants embrace and part several ways,30
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,30
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live,30
To have his pomp and all what state compounds,30
Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart,30
When man's worst sin is he does too much good!,30
For bounty that makes gods does still mar men.,30
Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes,30
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat,30
Supply his life or that which can command it.,30
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;,30
Exit,30
Enter TIMON from the cave,30
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb,30
Whose procreation residence and birth,30
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,30
But by contempt of nature.,30
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,30
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,30
In purity of manhood stand upright,30
So are they all; for every grise of fortune,30
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;,30
But direct villany. Therefore be abhorr'd,30
His semblable yea himself Timon disdains:,30
Digging,30
With thy most operant poison! What is here?,30
I am no idle votarist: roots you clear heavens!,30
Wrong right base noble old young coward valiant.,30
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,30
This yellow slave,30
Make the hoar leprosy adored place thieves,30
With senators on the bench: this is it,30
She whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores,30
To the April day again. Come damned earth,30
Among the route of nations I will make thee,30
March afar off,30
But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go strong thief,30
Nay stay thou out for earnest.,30
Enter ALCIBIADES with drum and fife in warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA,30
A beast as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,30
What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,30
I am Misanthropos and hate mankind.,30
That I might love thee something.,30
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.,30
I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;,30
Religious canons civil laws are cruel;,30
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,30
Thy lips rot off!,30
To thine own lips again.,30
As the moon does by wanting light to give:,30
There were no suns to borrow of.,30
What friendship may I do thee?,30
Maintain my opinion.,30
Promise me friendship but perform none: if thou,30
a man! if thou dost perform confound thee for,30
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.,30
I see them now; then was a blessed time.,30
Is this the Athenian minion whom the world,30
Art thou Timandra?,30
Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;,30
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves,30
To the tub-fast and the diet.,30
Pardon him sweet Timandra; for his wits,30
I have but little gold of late brave Timon,30
In my penurious band: I have heard and grieved,30
Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states,30
I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.,30
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?,30
Why fare thee well:,30
Keep it I cannot eat it.,30
Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?,30
The gods confound them all in thy conquest;,30
Why me Timon?,30
Thou wast born to conquer my country.,30
Be as a planetary plague when Jove,30
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:,30
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;,30
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek,30
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,30
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,30
Think it a bastard whom the oracle,30
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;,30
Whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes,30
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:,30
Confounded be thyself! Speak not be gone.,30
givest me,30
Dost thou or dost thou not heaven's curse,30
Give us some gold good Timon: hast thou more?,30
And to make whores a bawd. Hold up you sluts,30
Although I know you 'll swear terribly swear,30
The immortal gods that hear you--spare your oaths,30
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,30
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,30
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs,30
No matter:--wear them betray with them: whore still;,30
A pox of wrinkles!,30
Believe't that we'll do any thing for gold.,30
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,30
That he may never more false title plead,30
That scolds against the quality of flesh,30
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away,30
Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate,30
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war,30
That your activity may defeat and quell,30
Do you damn others and let this damn you,30
More counsel with more money bounteous Timon.,30
Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell Timon:,30
If I hope well I'll never see thee more.,30
Yes thou spokest well of me.,30
Men daily find it. Get thee away and take,30
We but offend him. Strike!,30
That nature being sick of man's unkindness,30
Digging,30
Teems and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,30
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,30
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven,30
Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate,30
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,30
Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears;,30
Hath to the marbled mansion all above,30
Dry up thy marrows vines and plough-torn leas;,30
And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind,30
Enter APEMANTUS,30
I was directed hither: men report,30
Tis then because thou dost not keep a dog,30
This is in thee a nature but infected;,30
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?,30
Thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft;,30
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,30
Be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive,30
And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe,30
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;,30
To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just,30
Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.,30
Thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself;,30
That the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain,30
That have outlived the eagle page thy heels,30
cold brook,30
To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures,30
Of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks,30
Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;,30
A fool of thee: depart.,30
I hate thee worse.,30
Thou flatter'st misery.,30
Why dost thou seek me out?,30
Always a villain's office or a fool's.,30
Ay.,30
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on,30
Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,30
Outlives encertain pomp is crown'd before:,30
The other at high wish: best state contentless,30
Worse than the worst content.,30
Not by his breath that is more miserable.,30
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.,30
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords,30
Freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself,30
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd,30
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,30
The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men,30
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves,30
Fell from their boughs and left me open bare,30
That never knew but better is some burden:,30
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?,30
If thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag,30
To some she beggar and compounded thee,30
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,30
Art thou proud yet?,30
I that I was,30
I that I am one now:,30
I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.,30
Thus would I eat it.,30
Here; I will mend thy feast.,30
First mend my company take away thyself.,30
Tis not well mended so it is but botch'd;,30
What wouldst thou have to Athens?,30
Tell them there I have gold; look so I have.,30
The best and truest;,30
Where liest o' nights Timon?,30
Where feed'st thou o' days Apemantus?,30
it.,30
Where wouldst thou send it?,30
The middle of humanity thou never knewest but the,30
and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much,30
despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for,30
On what I hate I feed not.,30
Ay though it look like thee.,30
have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou,30
Who without those means thou talkest of didst thou,30
Myself.,30
dog.,30
to thy flatterers?,30
themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,30
Give it the beasts to be rid of the men.,30
men and remain a beast with the beasts?,30
A beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t',30
beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb the fox would,30
suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by,30
torment thee and still thou livedst but as a,30
greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst,30
unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and,30
thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse:,30
leopard: wert thou a leopard thou wert german to,30
thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy,30
were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art,30
transformation!,30
mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of,30
How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city?,30
company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it,30
see thee again.,30
welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.,30
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!,30
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.,30
If I name thee.,30
I would my tongue could rot them off!,30
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;,30
Would thou wouldst burst!,30
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose,30
Throws a stone at him,30
Slave!,30
Rogue rogue rogue!,30
But even the mere necessities upon 't.,30
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat,30
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.,30
O thou sweet king-killer and dear divorce,30
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!,30
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow,30
That solder'st close impossibilities,30
every tongue,30
Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue,30
May have the world in empire!,30
But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:,30
Throng'd to!,30
Thy back I prithee.,30
Long live so and so die.,30
I am quit.,30
Enter Banditti,30
fragment some slender sort of his remainder: the,30
friends drove him into this melancholy.,30
Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not,30
reserve it how shall's get it?,30
Is not this he?,30
Tis his description.,30
Save thee Timon.,30
Soldiers not thieves.,30
We are not thieves but men that much do want.,30
Why should you want? Behold the earth hath roots;,30
The oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hips;,30
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?,30
As beasts and birds and fishes.,30
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con,30
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft,30
Here's gold. Go suck the subtle blood o' the grape,30
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;,30
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;,30
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.,30
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,30
The sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves,30
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen,30
The laws your curb and whip in their rough power,30
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:,30
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,30
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.,30
persuading me to it.,30
us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.,30
Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time,30
Exeunt Banditti,30
O you gods!,30
Full of decay and failing? O monument,30
What an alteration of honour,30
What viler thing upon the earth than friends,30
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,30
Grant I may ever love and rather woo,30
Has caught me in his eye: I will present,30
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!,30
Have you forgot me sir?,30
Then if thou grant'st thou'rt a man I have forgot thee.,30
Then I know thee not:,30
I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains.,30
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief,30
What dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I,30
Because thou art a woman and disclaim'st,30
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:,30
I beg of you to know me good my lord,30
To entertain me as your steward still.,30
So true so just and now so comfortable?,30
Let me behold thy face. Surely this man,30
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,30
One honest man--mistake me not--but one;,30
How fain would I have hated all mankind!,30
I fell with curses.,30
For by oppressing and betraying me,30
For many so arrive at second masters,30
For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure--,30
If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts,30
No my most worthy master; in whose breast,30
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:,30
That which I show heaven knows is merely love,30
Care of your food and living; and believe it,30
For any benefit that points to me,30
For this one wish that you had power and wealth,30
Look thee 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,30
Have sent thee treasure. Go live rich and happy;,30
Hate all curse all show charity to none,30
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs,30
Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like,30
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!,30
O let me stay,30
If thou hatest curses,30
Ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee.,30
ACT V,30
Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cave,30
he abides.,30
for true that he's so full of gold?,30
Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor,30
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.,30
Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens,30
tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this,30
us; and is very likely to load our purposes with,30
that goes of his having.,30
Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will,30
I must serve him so too tell him of an intent,30
Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the,30
performance is ever the duller for his act; and,30
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is,30
of will or testament which argues a great sickness,30
TIMON comes from his cave behind,30
man so bad as is thyself.,30
him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire,30
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.,30
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in,30
Nay let's seek him:,30
When we may profit meet and come too late.,30
When the day serves before black-corner'd night,30
[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a,30
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple,30
Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,30
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye,30
Fit I meet them.,30
Hail worthy Timon!,30
Have I once lived to see two honest men?,30
Having often of your open bounty tasted,30
Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--,30
What! to you,30
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover,30
With any size of words.,30
You that are honest by being what you are,30
He and myself,30
And sweetly felt it.,30
We are hither come to offer you our service.,30
Can you eat roots and drink cold water? no.,30
Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;,30
So it is said my noble lord; but therefore,30
Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit,30
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.,30
E'en so sir as I say. And for thy fiction,30
That thou art even natural in thine art.,30
I must needs say you have a little fault:,30
You take much pains to mend.,30
To make it known to us.,30
Most thankfully my lord.,30
Doubt it not worthy lord.,30
That mightily deceives you.,30
Ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble,30
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured,30
I know none such my lord.,30
Look you I love you well; I'll give you gold,30
Hang them or stab them drown them in a draught,30
I'll give you gold enough.,30
You that way and you this but two in company;,30
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.,30
Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside,30
Hence pack! there's gold; you came for gold ye slaves:,30
You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!,30
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.,30
Beats them out and then retires to his cave,30
It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;,30
That nothing but himself which looks like man,30
Bring us to his cave:,30
To speak with Timon.,30
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs,30
Offering the fortunes of his former days,30
And chance it as it may.,30
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!,30
By two of their most reverend senate greet thee:,30
TIMON comes from his cave,30
be hang'd:,30
Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,30
Worthy Timon--,30
The senators of Athens greet thee Timon.,30
Could I but catch it for them.,30
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.,30
Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought,30
For thy best use and wearing.,30
Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross:,30
Play the recanter feeling in itself,30
Of its own fail restraining aid to Timon;,30
Together with a recompense more fruitful,30
Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth,30
And write in thee the figures of their love,30
You witch me in it;,30
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,30
Therefore so please thee to return with us,30
The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks,30
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back,30
Who like a boar too savage doth root up,30
And shakes his threatening sword,30
Therefore Timon--,30
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,30
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,30
Giving our holy virgins to the stain,30
Then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it,30
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,30
While you have throats to answer: for myself,30
But I do prize it at my love before,30
To the protection of the prosperous gods,30
Stay not all's in vain.,30
it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness,30
And nothing brings me all things. Go live still;,30
And last so long enough!,30
But yet I love my country and am not,30
As common bruit doth put it.,30
Commend me to my loving countrymen--,30
thorough them.,30
In their applauding gates.,30
And tell them that to ease them of their griefs,30
Their pangs of love with other incident throes,30
In life's uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them:,30
I like this well; he will return again.,30
That mine own use invites me to cut down,30
Tell Athens in the sequence of degree,30
To stop affliction let him take his haste,30
And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.,30
Come not to me again: but say to Athens,30
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;,30
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,30
Lips let sour words go by and language end:,30
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!,30
Retires to his cave,30
Coupled to nature.,30
And strain what other means is left unto us,30
It requires swift foot.,30
SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.,30
Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files,30
have spoke the least:,30
Present approach.,30
I met a courier one mine ancient friend;,30
Yet our old love made a particular force,30
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,30
His fellowship i' the cause against your city,30
Here come our brothers.,30
No talk of Timon nothing of him expect.,30
Doth choke the air with dust: in and prepare:,30
Exeunt,30
Enter a Soldier seeking TIMON,30
Who's here? speak ho! No answer! What is this?,30
Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.,30
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:,30
An aged interpreter though young in days:,30
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.,30
SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.,30
Sound to this coward and lascivious town,30
A parley sounded,30
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time,30
The scope of justice; till now myself and such,30
Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed,30
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong,30
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,30
With fear and horrid flight.,30
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,30
We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,30
Above their quantity.,30
Transformed Timon to our city's love,30
We were not all unkind nor all deserve,30
These walls of ours,30
You have received your griefs; nor are they such,30
should fall,30
Nor are they living,30
Shame that they wanted cunning in excess,30
Into our city with thy banners spread:,30
If thy revenges hunger for that food,30
And by the hazard of the spotted die,30
All have not offended;,30
On those that are revenges: crimes like lands,30
Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage:,30
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall,30
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,30
What thou wilt,30
Than hew to't with thy sword.,30
Against our rampired gates and they shall ope;,30
To say thou'lt enter friendly.,30
Or any token of thine honour else,30
And not as our confusion all thy powers,30
Have seal'd thy full desire.,30
Descend and open your uncharged ports:,30
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof,30
With my more noble meaning not a man,30
Of regular justice in your city's bounds,30
At heaviest answer.,30
Descend and keep your words.,30
Enter Soldier,30
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;,30
With wax I brought away whose soft impression,30
[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a,30
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked,30
Here lie I Timon; who alive all living men did hate:,30
not here thy gait.',30
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,30
droplets which,30
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye,30
Is noble Timon: of whose memory,30
And I will use the olive with my sword,30
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.,30
Exeunt,30
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol.,31
Noble patricians patrons of my right,31
And countrymen my loving followers,31
I am his first-born son that was the last,31
Then let my father's honours live in me,31
Romans friends followers favorers of my right,31
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,31
And suffer not dishonour to approach,31
To justice continence and nobility;,31
And Romans fight for freedom in your choice.,31
Princes that strive by factions and by friends,31
Know that the people of Rome for whom we stand,31
In election for the Roman empery,31
For many good and great deserts to Rome:,31
Lives not this day within the city walls:,31
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;,31
Hath yoked a nation strong train'd up in arms.,31
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms,31
Bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons,31
And now at last laden with horror's spoils,31
Renowned Titus flourishing in arms.,31
Whom worthily you would have now succeed.,31
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,31
Dismiss your followers and as suitors should,31
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!,31
In thy uprightness and integrity,31
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,31
Gracious Lavinia Rome's rich ornament,31
And to my fortunes and the people's favor,31
Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS,31
I thank you all and here dismiss you all,31
Commit myself my person and the cause.,31
Rome be as just and gracious unto me,31
Open the gates and let me in.,31
Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol,31
Romans make way: the good Andronicus.,31
Successful in the battles that he fights,31
From where he circumscribed with his sword,31
Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and  MUTIUS; After them two Men bearing a coffin  covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After  them TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA with  ALARBUS DEMETRIUS CHIRON AARON and other Goths  prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The Bearers set down the coffin and TITUS speaks,31
Lo as the bark that hath discharged her fraught,31
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,31
To re-salute his country with his tears,31
Thou great defender of this Capitol,31
Romans of five and twenty valiant sons,31
Behold the poor remains alive and dead!,31
These that I bring unto their latest home,31
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.,31
Why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet,31
Make way to lay them by their brethren.,31
There greet in silence as the dead are wont,31
O sacred receptacle of my joys,31
How many sons of mine hast thou in store,31
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,31
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,31
That so the shadows be not unappeased,31
I give him you the noblest that survives,31
Stay Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,31
A mother's tears in passion for her son:,31
O think my son to be as dear to me!,31
To beautify thy triumphs and return,31
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,31
O if to fight for king and commonweal,31
Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood:,31
Draw near them then in being merciful:,31
Thrice noble Titus spare my first-born son.,31
These are their brethren whom you Goths beheld,31
Religiously they ask a sacrifice:,31
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.,31
And with our swords upon a pile of wood,31
Exeunt LUCIUS QUINTUS MARTIUS and MUTIUS with ALARBUS,31
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?,31
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive,31
Then madam stand resolved but hope withal,31
With opportunity of sharp revenge,31
May favor Tamora the Queen of Goths--,31
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.,31
See lord and father how we have perform'd,31
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,31
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,31
Let it be so; and let Andronicus,31
Trumpets sounded and the coffin laid in the tomb,31
Rome's readiest champions repose you here in rest,31
Here lurks no treason here no envy swells,31
No noise but silence and eternal sleep:,31
Enter LAVINIA,31
My noble lord and father live in fame!,31
I render for my brethren's obsequies;,31
Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome:,31
Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!,31
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!,31
And fame's eternal date for virtue's praise!,31
Long live Lord Titus my beloved brother,31
Thanks gentle tribune noble brother Marcus.,31
You that survive and you that sleep in fame!,31
That in your country's service drew your swords:,31
That hath aspired to Solon's happiness,31
Titus Andronicus the people of Rome,31
Send thee by me their tribune and their trust,31
And name thee in election for the empire,31
Be candidatus then and put it on,31
A better head her glorious body fits,31
What should I don this robe and trouble you?,31
To-morrow yield up rule resign my life,31
Rome I have been thy soldier forty years,31
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,31
In right and service of their noble country,31
But not a sceptre to control the world:,31
Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.,31
Patience Prince Saturninus.,31
Patricians draw your swords: and sheathe them not,31
Andronicus would thou wert shipp'd to hell,31
Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good,31
Content thee prince; I will restore to thee,31
Andronicus I do not flatter thee,31
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,31
Of noble minds is honourable meed.,31
I ask your voices and your suffrages:,31
To gratify the good Andronicus,31
The people will accept whom he admits.,31
That you create your emperor's eldest son,31
Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,31
Then if you will elect by my advice,31
With voices and applause of every sort,31
Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,31
A long flourish till they come down,31
To us in our election this day,31
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:,31
Thy name and honourable family,31
Rome's royal mistress mistress of my heart,31
Tell me Andronicus doth this motion please thee?,31
I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:,31
King and commander of our commonweal,31
My sword my chariot and my prisoners;,31
Receive them then the tribute that I owe,31
Thanks noble Titus father of my life!,31
Rome shall record and when I do forget,31
Romans forget your fealty to me.,31
an emperor;,31
Will use you nobly and your followers.,31
That I would choose were I to choose anew.,31
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,31
Princely shall be thy usage every way.,31
Daunt all your hopes: madam he comforts you,31
Lavinia you are not displeased with this?,31
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.,31
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:,31
Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show,31
Seizing LAVINIA,31
Ay noble Titus; and resolved withal,31
Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:,31
And that he will and shall if Lucius live.,31
Treason my lord! Lavinia is surprised!,31
By him that justly may,31
Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA,31
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.,31
Follow my lord and I'll soon bring her back.,31
What villain boy!,31
Stabbing MUTIUS,31
Dies,31
Re-enter LUCIUS,31
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.,31
My sons would never so dishonour me:,31
Dead if you will; but not to be his wife,31
Exit,31
Nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock:,31
Thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons,31
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,31
Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,31
O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?,31
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword,31
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,31
These words are razors to my wounded heart.,31
That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs,31
If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,31
And will create thee empress of Rome,31
And here I swear by all the Roman gods,31
And tapers burn so bright and every thing,31
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,31
I lead espoused my bride along with me.,31
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,31
A loving nurse a mother to his youth.,31
Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,31
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:,31
Exeunt all but TITUS,31
Titus when wert thou wont to walk alone,31
Re-enter MARCUS LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS,31
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.,31
Nor thou nor these confederates in the deed,31
Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!,31
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.,31
This monument five hundred years hath stood,31
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors,31
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.,31
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him,31
And shall or him we will accompany.,31
that word?,31
What would you bury him in my despite?,31
To pardon Mutius and to bury him.,31
And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded:,31
So trouble me no more but get you gone.,31
Not I till Mutius' bones be buried.,31
Brother for in that name doth nature plead--,31
Speak thou no more if all the rest will speed.,31
Dear father soul and substance of us all--,31
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,31
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:,31
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son,31
Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy,31
Rise Marcus rise.,31
To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!,31
MUTIUS is put into the tomb,31
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.,31
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.,31
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths,31
I know not Marcus; but I know it is,31
Is she not then beholding to the man,31
Yes and will nobly him remunerate.,31
So Bassianus you have play'd your prize:,31
And you of yours my lord! I say no more,31
Traitor if Rome have law or we have power,31
Rape call you it my lord to seize my own,31
But let the laws of Rome determine all;,31
Tis good sir: you are very short with us;,31
My lord what I have done as best I may,31
Only thus much I give your grace to know:,31
This noble gentleman Lord Titus here,31
That in the rescue of Lavinia,31
In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath,31
Receive him then to favor Saturnine,31
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.,31
Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.,31
How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!,31
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,31
And at my suit sweet pardon what is past.,31
And basely put it up without revenge?,31
I should be author to dishonour you!,31
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;,31
Then at my suit look graciously on him;,31
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.,31
be won at last;,31
You are but newly planted in your throne;,31
Upon a just survey take Titus' part,31
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,31
I'll find a day to massacre them all,31
The cruel father and his traitorous sons,31
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen,31
Aloud,31
Take up this good old man and cheer the heart,31
Rise Titus rise; my empress hath prevail'd.,31
These words these looks infuse new life in me.,31
A Roman now adopted happily,31
This day all quarrels die Andronicus;,31
That I have reconciled your friends and you.,31
My word and promise to the emperor,31
And fear not lords and you Lavinia;,31
You shall ask pardon of his majesty.,31
That what we did was mildly as we might,31
That on mine honour here I do protest.,31
Nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends:,31
I will not be denied: sweet heart look back.,31
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,31
Lavinia though you left me like a churl,31
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.,31
You are my guest Lavinia and your friends.,31
To-morrow an it please your majesty,31
With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.,31
Flourish. Exeunt,31
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.,31
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,31
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;,31
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,31
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,31
So Tamora:,31
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.,31
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,31
Hast prisoner held fetter'd in amorous chains,31
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.,31
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,31
To wait said I? to wanton with this queen,31
This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,31
Holloa! what storm is this?,31
Chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge,31
And may for aught thou know'st affected be.,31
And so in this to bear me down with braves.,31
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:,31
To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace;,31
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.,31
the peace.,31
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,31
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath,31
Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have,31
Ay boy grow ye so brave?,31
[Coming forward]  Why how now lords!,31
And maintain such a quarrel openly?,31
I would not for a million of gold,31
Nor would your noble mother for much more,31
For shame put up.,31
My rapier in his bosom and withal,31
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.,31
Foul-spoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue,31
Away I say!,31
This petty brabble will undo us all.,31
It is to jet upon a prince's right?,31
Or Bassianus so degenerate,31
Without controlment justice or revenge?,31
This discord's ground the music would not please.,31
I love Lavinia more than all the world.,31
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.,31
How furious and impatient they be,31
I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths,31
Aaron a thousand deaths,31
To achieve her! how?,31
She is a woman therefore may be woo'd;,31
She is Lavinia therefore must be loved.,31
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is,31
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.,31
[Aside]  Ay and as good as Saturninus may.,31
With words fair looks and liberality?,31
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?,31
Would serve your turns.,31
Aaron thou hast hit it.,31
Then should not we be tired with this ado.,31
To square for this? would it offend you then,31
Faith not me.,31
For shame be friends and join for that you jar:,31
That you affect; and so must you resolve,31
You must perforce accomplish as you may.,31
Than this Lavinia Bassianus' love.,31
Must we pursue and I have found the path.,31
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:,31
And many unfrequented plots there are,31
Single you thither then this dainty doe,31
This way or not at all stand you in hope.,31
To villany and vengeance consecrate,31
And she shall file our engines with advice,31
But to your wishes' height advance you both.,31
The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears:,31
There speak and strike brave boys and take,31
There serve your lusts shadow'd from heaven's eye,31
Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice,31
To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits.,31
Exeunt,31
Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS with Hunters  and c. MARCUS LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS,31
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:,31
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride,31
That all the court may echo with the noise.,31
To attend the emperor's person carefully:,31
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.,31
Many good morrows to your majesty;,31
I promised your grace a hunter's peal.,31
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.,31
I say no;,31
Come on then; horse and chariots let us have,31
To TAMORA,31
Our Roman hunting.,31
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,31
And I have horse will follow where the game,31
Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound,31
Exeunt,31
Enter AARON with a bag of gold,31
To bury so much gold under a tree,31
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly,31
Which cunningly effected will beget,31
And so repose sweet gold for their unrest,31
That have their alms out of the empress' chest.,31
My lovely Aaron wherefore look'st thou sad,31
The birds chant melody on every bush,31
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind,31
Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit,31
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,31
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;,31
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,31
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,31
Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber;,31
Be unto us as is a nurse's song,31
Madam though Venus govern your desires,31
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,31
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls,31
To do some fatal execution?,31
Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand,31
Hark Tamora the empress of my soul,31
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:,31
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,31
Seest thou this letter? take it up I pray thee,31
Now question me no more; we are espied;,31
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.,31
No more great empress; Bassianus comes:,31
To back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be.,31
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA,31
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?,31
Who hath abandoned her holy groves,31
Saucy controller of our private steps!,31
Thy temples should be planted presently,31
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,31
Under your patience gentle empress,31
And to be doubted that your Moor and you,31
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!,31
Believe me queen your swarth Cimmerian,31
Spotted detested and abominable.,31
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.,31
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,31
And being intercepted in your sport,31
For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,31
This valley fits the purpose passing well.,31
Ay for these slips have made him noted long:,31
Why have I patience to endure all this?,31
How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother!,31
Have I not reason think you to look pale?,31
A barren detested vale you see it is;,31
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:,31
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:,31
They told me here at dead time of the night,31
Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins,31
As any mortal body hearing it,31
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,31
Unto the body of a dismal yew,31
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,31
That ever ear did hear to such effect:,31
This vengeance on me had they executed.,31
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.,31
Stabs BASSIANUS,31
Also stabs BASSIANUS who dies,31
For no name fits thy nature but thy own!,31
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.,31
First thrash the corn then after burn the straw:,31
Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty,31
And shall she carry this unto her grave?,31
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,31
But when ye have the honey ye desire,31
I warrant you madam we wil l make that sure.,31
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.,31
I will not hear her speak; away with her!,31
Listen fair madam: let it be your glory,31
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.,31
O do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;,31
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.,31
To CHIRON,31
What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?,31
Yet have I heard--O could I find it now!--,31
To have his princely paws pared all away:,31
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:,31
Nothing so kind but something pitiful!,31
O let me teach thee! for my father's sake,31
slain thee,31
Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,31
Remember boys I pour'd forth tears in vain,31
But fierce Andronicus would not relent;,31
The worse to her the better loved of me.,31
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!,31
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.,31
Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,31
O keep me from their worse than killing lust,31
Where never man's eye may behold my body:,31
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:,31
Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.,31
The blot and enemy to our general name!,31
Nay then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:,31
DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON dragging off LAVINIA,31
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,31
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,31
Exit,31
Come on my lords the better foot before:,31
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.,31
And mine I promise you; were't not for shame,31
Falls into the pit,31
Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,31
As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?,31
Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall?,31
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!,31
That he thereby may give a likely guess,31
Exit,31
From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?,31
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:,31
To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,31
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.,31
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold,31
O tell me how it is; for ne'er till now,31
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,31
In this detested dark blood-drinking pit.,31
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear,31
Which like a taper in some monument,31
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:,31
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.,31
If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath--,31
As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.,31
Or wanting strength to do thee so much good,31
Of this deep pit poor Bassianus' grave.,31
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.,31
Till thou art here aloft or I below:,31
Falls in,31
Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,31
Say who art thou that lately didst descend,31
The unhappy son of old Andronicus:,31
To find thy brother Bassianus dead.,31
He and his lady both are at the lodge,31
Tis not an hour since I left him there.,31
But out alas! here have we found him dead.,31
Where is my lord the king?,31
Where is thy brother Bassianus?,31
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.,31
The complot of this timeless tragedy;,31
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.,31
[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--,31
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:,31
Among the nettles at the elder-tree,31
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.,31
O Tamora! was ever heard the like?,31
Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out,31
My gracious lord here is the bag of gold.,31
bloody kind,31
Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison:,31
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.,31
How easily murder is discovered!,31
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,31
Accursed if the fault be proved in them--,31
Who found this letter? Tamora was it you?,31
I did my lord: yet let me be their bail;,31
They shall be ready at your highness' will,31
Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.,31
Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;,31
That end upon them should be executed.,31
Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.,31
Exeunt,31
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA ravished; her hands cut off and her tongue cut out,31
Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.,31
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.,31
Go home call for sweet water wash thy hands.,31
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.,31
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.,31
Enter MARCUS,31
Cousin a word; where is your husband?,31
If I do wake some planet strike me down,31
Speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands,31
Of her two branches those sweet ornaments,31
And might not gain so great a happiness,31
Alas a crimson river of warm blood,31
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,31
But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,31
Ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!,31
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,31
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.,31
O that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,31
Sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd,31
Fair Philomela she but lost her tongue,31
But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee;,31
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,31
O had the monster seen those lily hands,31
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,31
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony,31
He would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep,31
Come let us go and make thy father blind;,31
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;,31
Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee,31
Exeunt,31
SCENE I. Rome. A street.,31
Hear me grave fathers! noble tribunes stay!,31
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;,31
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;,31
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;,31
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.,31
Because they died in honour's lofty bed.,31
For these these tribunes in the dust I write,31
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;,31
O earth I will befriend thee more with rain,31
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:,31
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow,31
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.,31
O reverend tribunes! O gentle aged men!,31
And let me say that never wept before,31
O noble father you lament in vain:,31
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.,31
Grave tribunes once more I entreat of you--,31
Why tis no matter man; if they did hear,31
They would not pity me yet plead I must;,31
Who though they cannot answer my distress,31
For that they will not intercept my tale:,31
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;,31
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.,31
A stone is silent and offendeth not,31
Rises,31
To rescue my two brothers from their death:,31
My everlasting doom of banishment.,31
Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive,31
Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey,31
From these devourers to be banished!,31
Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA,31
Or if not so thy noble heart to break:,31
Will it consume me? let me see it then.,31
Why Marcus so she is.,31
Faint-hearted boy arise and look upon her.,31
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?,31
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?,31
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.,31
For they have fought for Rome and all in vain;,31
In bootless prayer have they been held up,31
Now all the service I require of them,31
Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands;,31
Speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee?,31
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,31
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung,31
O say thou for her who hath done this deed?,31
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer,31
It was my deer; and he that wounded her,31
For now I stand as one upon a rock,31
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,31
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.,31
Here stands my other son a banished man,31
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,31
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,31
Now I behold thy lively body so?,31
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:,31
Thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this.,31
When I did name her brothers then fresh tears,31
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.,31
Perchance because she knows them innocent.,31
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.,31
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.,31
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:,31
And thou and I sit round about some fountain,31
How they are stain'd as meadows yet not dry,31
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,31
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?,31
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows,31
What shall we do? let us that have our tongues,31
To make us wonder'd at in time to come.,31
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.,31
Ah Marcus Marcus! brother well I wot,31
For thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine own.,31
Mark Marcus mark! I understand her signs:,31
That to her brother which I said to thee:,31
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.,31
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!,31
Titus Andronicus my lord the emperor,31
Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus,31
And send it to the king: he for the same,31
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.,31
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,31
With all my heart I'll send the emperor My hand:,31
Stay father! for that noble hand of thine,31
Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:,31
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.,31
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,31
O none of both but are of high desert:,31
To ransom my two nephews from their death;,31
Nay come agree whose hand shall go along,31
My hand shall go.,31
Sirs strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these,31
Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son,31
And for our father's sake and mother's care,31
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.,31
But I will use the axe.,31
Come hither Aaron; I'll deceive them both:,31
[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit I will be honest,31
But I'll deceive you in another sort,31
Cuts off TITUS's hand,31
Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.,31
Tell him it was a hand that warded him,31
More hath it merited; that let it have.,31
As jewels purchased at an easy price;,31
I go Andronicus: and for thy hand,31
Aside,31
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!,31
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.,31
O here I lift this one hand up to heaven,31
If any power pities wretched tears,31
To LAVINIA,31
Do then dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;,31
And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds,31
O brother speak with possibilities,31
Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom?,31
But yet let reason govern thy lament.,31
Then into limits could I bind my woes:,31
If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad,31
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?,31
She is the weeping welkin I the earth:,31
Then must my earth with her continual tears,31
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,31
Then give me leave for losers will have leave,31
Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand,31
For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.,31
And here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back;,31
That woe is me to think upon thy woes,31
Exit,31
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!,31
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;,31
Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound,31
That ever death should let life bear his name,31
LAVINIA kisses TITUS,31
As frozen water to a starved snake.,31
Now farewell flattery: die Andronicus;,31
Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here:,31
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother I,31
Ah now no more will I control thy griefs:,31
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight,31
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?,31
Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.,31
Besides this sorrow is an enemy,31
And make them blind with tributary tears:,31
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,31
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again,31
Come let me see what task I have to do.,31
That I may turn me to each one of you,31
The vow is made. Come brother take a head;,31
Lavinia thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!,31
As for thee boy go get thee from my sight;,31
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there:,31
Let's kiss and part for we have much to do.,31
Farewell Andronicus my noble father,31
Farewell proud Rome; till Lucius come again,31
Farewell Lavinia my noble sister;,31
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives,31
If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs;,31
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.,31
To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.,31
SCENE II. A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.,31
So so; now sit: and look you eat no more,31
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.,31
Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands,31
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine,31
Who when my heart all mad with misery,31
Then thus I thump it down.,31
Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs!,31
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.,31
Or get some little knife between thy teeth,31
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall,31
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.,31
Such violent hands upon her tender life.,31
Why Marcus no man should be mad but I.,31
Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;,31
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?,31
Lest we remember still that we have none.,31
As if we should forget we had no hands,31
Come let's fall to; and gentle girl eat this:,31
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;,31
Brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks:,31
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect,31
Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven,31
But I of these will wrest an alphabet,31
Good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments:,31
Alas the tender boy in passion moved,31
Peace tender sapling; thou art made of tears,31
MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife,31
At that that I have kill'd my lord; a fly.,31
Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:,31
Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:,31
Alas my lord I have but kill'd a fly.,31
How would he hang his slender gilded wings,31
Poor harmless fly,31
Came here to make us merry! and thou hast,31
Pardon me sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,31
O O O,31
For thou hast done a charitable deed.,31
Flattering myself as if it were the Moor,31
There's for thyself and that's for Tamora.,31
Yet I think we are not brought so low,31
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.,31
He takes false shadows for true substances.,31
I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee,31
Come boy and go with me: thy sight is young,31
Exeunt,31
SCENE I. Rome. Titus's garden.,31
Help grandsire help! my aunt Lavinia,31
Good uncle Marcus see how swift she comes.,31
Stand by me Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.,31
Ay when my father was in Rome she did.,31
Fear her not Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:,31
Somewhither would she have thee go with her.,31
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee,31
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?,31
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:,31
Extremity of griefs would make men mad;,31
Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;,31
Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,31
Which made me down to throw my books and fly--,31
And madam if my uncle Marcus go,31
Lucius I will.,31
How now Lavinia! Marcus what means this?,31
Which is it girl of these? Open them boy.,31
Come and take choice of all my library,31
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.,31
I think she means that there was more than one,31
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.,31
Grandsire 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;,31
For love of her that's gone,31
Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!,31
What would she find? Lavinia shall I read?,31
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:,31
See brother see; note how she quotes the leaves.,31
Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was,31
Ay such a place there is where we did hunt--,31
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,31
O why should nature build so foul a den,31
Give signs sweet girl for here are none,31
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:,31
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?,31
Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury,31
My lord look here: look here Lavinia:,31
This after me when I have writ my name,31
He writes his name with his staff and guides it with feet and mouth,31
Write thou good niece; and here display at last,31
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,31
She takes the staff in her mouth and guides it with her stumps and writes,31
Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.',31
Performers of this heinous bloody deed?,31
Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?,31
There is enough written upon this earth,31
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.,31
And kneel sweet boy the Roman Hector's hope;,31
And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,31
That we will prosecute by good advice,31
And see their blood or die with this reproach.,31
But if you hunt these bear-whelps then beware:,31
She's with the lion deeply still in league,31
And when he sleeps will she do what she list.,31
And come I will go get a leaf of brass,31
And lay it by: the angry northern wind,31
And where's your lesson then? Boy what say you?,31
Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe,31
Ay that's my boy! thy father hath full oft,31
And uncle so will I an if I live.,31
Lucius I'll fit thee; and withal my boy,31
Presents that I intend to send them both:,31
Ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire.,31
Lavinia come. Marcus look to my house:,31
Ay marry will we sir; and we'll be waited on.,31
O heavens can you hear a good man groan,31
Marcus attend him in his ecstasy,31
Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;,31
Revenge ye heavens for old Andronicus!,31
SCENE II. The same. A room in the palace.,31
Demetrius here's the son of Lucius;,31
Ay some mad message from his mad grandfather.,31
I greet your honours from Andronicus.,31
And pray the Roman gods confound you both!,31
[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd that's the news,31
My grandsire well advised hath sent by me,31
To gratify your honourable youth,31
And so I do and with his gifts present,31
You may be armed and appointed well:,31
Aside,31
Exeunt Young LUCIUS and Attendant,31
Let's see;,31
Integer vitae scelerisque purus,31
O 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:,31
Ay just; a verse in Horace; right you have it.,31
Now what a thing it is to be an ass!,31
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,31
But were our witty empress well afoot,31
But let her rest in her unrest awhile.,31
Led us to Rome strangers and more than so,31
It did me good before the palace gate,31
But me more good to see so great a lord,31
Had he not reason Lord Demetrius?,31
I would we had a thousand Roman dames,31
A charitable wish and full of love.,31
And that would she for twenty thousand more.,31
For our beloved mother in her pains.,31
Trumpets sound within,31
Belike for joy the emperor hath a son.,31
Enter a Nurse with a blackamoor Child in her arms,31
O tell me did you see Aaron the Moor?,31
Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?,31
Now help or woe betide thee evermore!,31
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?,31
Our empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!,31
To whom?,31
Well God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?,31
Why then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.,31
Here is the babe as loathsome as a toad,31
The empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal,31
Zounds ye whore! is black so base a hue?,31
Villain what hast thou done?,31
Thou hast undone our mother.,31
And therein hellish dog thou hast undone.,31
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!,31
It shall not die.,31
What must it nurse? then let no man but I,31
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:,31
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.,31
Stay murderous villains! will you kill your brother?,31
That shone so brightly when this boy was got,31
That touches this my first-born son and heir!,31
With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,31
Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.,31
Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!,31
In that it scorns to bear another hue;,31
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,31
Tell the empress from me I am of age,31
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?,31
The vigour and the picture of my youth:,31
This maugre all the world will I keep safe,31
By this our mother is forever shamed.,31
The emperor in his rage will doom her death.,31
Why there's the privilege your beauty bears:,31
The close enacts and counsels of the heart!,31
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father,31
He is your brother lords sensibly fed,31
And from that womb where you imprison'd were,31
Nay he is your brother by the surer side,31
Aaron what shall I say unto the empress?,31
And we will all subscribe to thy advice:,31
Then sit we down and let us all consult.,31
Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.,31
How many women saw this child of his?,31
I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,31
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.,31
Cornelia the midwife and myself;,31
The empress the midwife and yourself:,31
Go to the empress tell her this I said.,31
Weke weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.,31
O Lord sir 'tis a deed of policy:,31
A long-tongued babbling gossip? no lords no:,31
Not far one Muli lives my countryman;,31
His child is like to her fair as you are:,31
And tell them both the circumstance of all;,31
And be received for the emperor's heir,31
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;,31
Hark ye lords; ye see I have given her physic,31
And you must needs bestow her funeral;,31
This done see that you take no longer days,31
The midwife and the nurse well made away,31
Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air,31
For this care of Tamora,31
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body,31
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,31
Come on you thick lipp'd slave I'll bear you hence;,31
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,31
And cabin in a cave and bring you up,31
Exit,31
Enter TITUS bearing arrows with letters at the  ends of them; with him MARCUS Young LUCIUS  PUBLIUS SEMPRONIUS CAIUS and other Gentlemen with bows,31
Sir boy now let me see your archery;,31
Terras Astraea reliquit:,31
Sirs take you to your tools. You cousins shall,31
Happily you may catch her in the sea;,31
No; Publius and Sempronius you must do it;,31
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:,31
I pray you deliver him this petition;,31
And that it comes from old Andronicus,31
Ah Rome! Well well; I made thee miserable,31
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.,31
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:,31
And kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice.,31
To see thy noble uncle thus distract?,31
By day and night to attend him carefully,31
Till time beget some careful remedy.,31
Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war,31
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.,31
What have you met with her?,31
If you will have Revenge from hell you shall:,31
He thinks with Jove in heaven or somewhere else,31
He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.,31
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.,31
No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;,31
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:,31
We will solicit heaven and move the gods,31
Come to this gear. You are a good archer Marcus;,31
Ad Jovem' that's for you: here 'Ad Apollinem:',31
Here boy to Pallas: here to Mercury:,31
You were as good to shoot against the wind.,31
Of my word I have written to effect;,31
Kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court:,31
Now masters draw.,31
O well said Lucius!,31
My lord I aim a mile beyond the moon;,31
Ha ha!,31
See see thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.,31
The Bull being gall'd gave Aries such a knock,31
And who should find them but the empress' villain?,31
But give them to his master for a present.,31
Enter a Clown with a basket and two pigeons in it,31
Sirrah what tidings? have you any letters?,31
O the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken,31
the next week.,31
Alas sir I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him,31
Why villain art not thou the carrier?,31
Why didst thou not come from heaven?,31
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my,31
tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl,31
Why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for,31
the emperor from you.,31
with a grace?,31
Sirrah come hither: make no more ado,31
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.,31
Give me pen and ink. Sirrah can you with a grace,31
Ay sir.,31
come to him at the first approach you must kneel,31
then look for your reward. I'll be at hand sir; see,31
I warrant you sir let me alone.,31
Here Marcus fold it in the oration;,31
And when thou hast given it the emperor,31
God be with you sir; I will.,31
Exeunt,31
Enter SATURNINUS TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON  Lords and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot,31
An emperor in Rome thus overborne,31
Of egal justice used in such contempt?,31
However these disturbers of our peace,31
But even with law against the willful sons,31
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,31
His fits his frenzy and his bitterness?,31
See here's to Jove and this to Mercury;,31
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!,31
And blazoning our injustice every where?,31
As who would say in Rome no justice were.,31
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:,31
In Saturninus' health whom if she sleep,31
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.,31
Lord of my life commander of my thoughts,31
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,31
And rather comfort his distressed plight,31
For these contempts.,31
Why thus it shall become,31
But Titus I have touched thee to the quick,31
Then is all safe the anchor's in the port.,31
How now good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?,31
Empress I am but yonder sits the emperor.,31
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.,31
Go take him away and hang him presently.,31
Come sirrah you must be hanged.,31
a fair end.,31
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!,31
I know from whence this same device proceeds:,31
That died by law for murder of our brother,31
Go drag the villain hither by the hair;,31
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;,31
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.,31
What news with thee AEmilius?,31
The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power,31
They hither march amain under conduct,31
Who threats in course of this revenge to do,31
Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?,31
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:,31
Tis he the common people love so much;,31
When I have walked like a private man,31
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.,31
Ay but the citizens favor Lucius,31
King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name.,31
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,31
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings,31
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.,31
I will enchant the old Andronicus,31
Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,31
The other rotted with delicious feed.,31
If Tamora entreat him then he will:,31
With golden promises; that were his heart,31
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.,31
Go thou before be our ambassador:,31
Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting,31
AEmilius do this message honourably:,31
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.,31
Exit,31
And temper him with all the art I have,31
And now sweet emperor be blithe again,31
Then go successantly and plead to him.,31
ACT V,31
Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths with drum and colours,31
I have received letters from great Rome,31
And how desirous of our sight they are.,31
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,31
Let him make treble satisfaction.,31
Whose name was once our terror now our comfort;,31
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,31
Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,31
And be avenged on cursed Tamora.,31
I humbly thank him and I thank you all.,31
Enter a Goth leading AARON with his Child in his arms,31
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;,31
Upon the wasted building suddenly,31
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard,31
Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam!,31
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,31
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,31
Peace villain peace!'--even thus he rates,31
For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;,31
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.',31
Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither,31
O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil,31
This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,31
Say wall-eyed slave whither wouldst thou convey,31
Why dost not speak? what deaf? not a word?,31
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.,31
Too like the sire for ever being good.,31
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.,31
A ladder brought which AARON is made to ascend,31
And bear it from me to the empress.,31
That highly may advantage thee to hear:,31
I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!',31
Thy child shall live and I will see it nourish'd.,31
Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;,31
Acts of black night abominable deeds,31
Ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd:,31
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.,31
Swear that he shall and then I will begin.,31
That granted how canst thou believe an oath?,31
Yet for I know thou art religious,31
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,31
Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know,31
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,31
By that same god what god soe'er it be,31
To save my boy to nourish and bring him up;,31
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.,31
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!,31
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.,31
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her,31
O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?,31
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.,31
Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them:,31
As sure a card as ever won the set;,31
As true a dog as ever fought at head.,31
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole,31
I wrote the letter that thy father found,31
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:,31
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?,31
And when I had it drew myself apart,31
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall,31
Beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily,31
And when I told the empress of this sport,31
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.,31
Ay like a black dog as the saying is.,31
Ay that I had not done a thousand more.,31
Few come within the compass of my curse--,31
As kill a man or else devise his death,31
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,31
Make poor men's cattle break their necks;,31
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.,31
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,31
And on their skins as on the bark of trees,31
Let not your sorrow die though I am dead.',31
As willingly as one would kill a fly,31
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.,31
So sweet a death as hanging presently.,31
To live and burn in everlasting fire,31
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!,31
Enter a Goth,31
Desires to be admitted to your presence.,31
Enter AEMILIUS,31
Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths,31
And for he understands you are in arms,31
Willing you to demand your hostages,31
What says our general?,31
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,31
Exeunt,31
Enter TAMORA DEMETRIUS and CHIRON disguised,31
I will encounter with Andronicus,31
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.,31
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;,31
And work confusion on his enemies.,31
Enter TITUS above,31
Is it your trick to make me ope the door,31
And all my study be to no effect?,31
See here in bloody lines I have set down;,31
Titus I am come to talk with thee.,31
Wanting a hand to give it action?,31
If thou didst know me thou wouldest talk with me.,31
Witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines;,31
Witness the tiring day and heavy night;,31
For our proud empress mighty Tamora:,31
Know thou sad man I am not Tamora;,31
I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,31
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.,31
Confer with me of murder and of death:,31
No vast obscurity or misty vale,31
Can couch for fear but I will find them out;,31
Revenge which makes the foul offender quake.,31
To be a torment to mine enemies?,31
Do me some service ere I come to thee.,31
Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,31
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,31
Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet,31
And find out murderers in their guilty caves:,31
I will dismount and by the waggon-wheel,31
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east,31
And day by day I'll do this heavy task,31
These are my ministers and come with me.,31
Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,31
Good Lord how like the empress' sons they are!,31
Have miserable mad mistaking eyes.,31
And if one arm's embracement will content thee,31
Exit above,31
Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,31
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;,31
I'll make him send for Lucius his son;,31
I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,31
Or at the least make them his enemies.,31
Enter TITUS below,31
Welcome dread Fury to my woful house:,31
How like the empress and her sons you are!,31
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?,31
But in her company there is a Moor;,31
It were convenient you had such a devil:,31
What wouldst thou have us do Andronicus?,31
Show me a villain that hath done a rape,31
Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,31
Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;,31
Good Murder stab him; he's a murderer.,31
To find another that is like to thee,31
Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court,31
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,31
I pray thee do on them some violent death;,31
Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.,31
To send for Lucius thy thrice-valiant son,31
And bid him come and banquet at thy house;,31
I will bring in the empress and her sons,31
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,31
What says Andronicus to this device?,31
Enter MARCUS,31
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:,31
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;,31
Tell him the emperor and the empress too,31
This do thou for my love; and so let him,31
This will I do and soon return again.,31
Now will I hence about thy business,31
Nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me;,31
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.,31
bide with him,31
How I have govern'd our determined jest?,31
And tarry with him till I turn again.,31
And will o'erreach them in their own devices:,31
Madam depart at pleasure; leave us here.,31
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.,31
Exit TAMORA,31
Tut I have work enough for you to do.,31
Enter PUBLIUS and others,31
Know you these two?,31
Fie Publius fie! thou art too much deceived;,31
And therefore bind them gentle Publius.,31
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,31
And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.,31
PUBLIUS  and c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS,31
And therefore do we what we are commanded.,31
Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.,31
Come come Lavinia; look thy foes are bound.,31
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.,31
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,31
You kill'd her husband and for that vile fault,31
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;,31
Than hands or tongue her spotless chastity,31
What would you say if I should let you speak?,31
Hark wretches! how I mean to martyr you.,31
Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold,31
You know your mother means to feast with me,31
Hark villains! I will grind your bones to dust,31
And of the paste a coffin I will rear,31
And bid that strumpet your unhallow'd dam,31
This is the feast that I have bid her to,31
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,31
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia come,31
Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,31
And with this hateful liquor temper it;,31
Come come be every one officious,31
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.,31
And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.,31
SCENE III. Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.,31
Uncle Marcus since it is my father's mind,31
And ours with thine befall what fortune will.,31
This ravenous tiger this accursed devil;,31
Till he be brought unto the empress' face,31
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;,31
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,31
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!,31
Sirs help our uncle to convey him in.,31
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.,31
What hath the firmament more suns than one?,31
Rome's emperor and nephew break the parle;,31
The feast is ready which the careful Titus,31
For peace for love for league and good to Rome:,31
Marcus we will.,31
Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook LAVINIA veiled  Young LUCIUS and others. TITUS places the dishes on the table,31
Welcome ye warlike Goths; welcome Lucius;,31
Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.,31
Because I would be sure to have all well,31
We are beholding to you good Andronicus.,31
My lord the emperor resolve me this:,31
To slay his daughter with his own right hand,31
It was Andronicus.,31
Because the girl should not survive her shame,31
A reason mighty strong and effectual;,31
For me most wretched to perform the like.,31
Kills LAVINIA,31
What hast thou done unnatural and unkind?,31
I am as woful as Virginius was,31
To do this outrage: and it now is done.,31
Will't please you eat? will't please your,31
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?,31
They ravish'd her and cut away her tongue;,31
Go fetch them hither to us presently.,31
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,31
Tis true 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.,31
Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed!,31
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?,31
Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS MARCUS and others go up into the balcony,31
By uproar sever'd like a flight of fowl,31
O let me teach you how to knit again,31
These broken limbs again into one body;,31
And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,31
Do shameful execution on herself.,31
Grave witnesses of true experience,31
To LUCIUS,31
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse,31
The story of that baleful burning night,31
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,31
That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound.,31
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,31
And break my utterance even in the time,31
Lending your kind commiseration.,31
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.,31
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius,31
And they it were that ravished our sister:,31
Our father's tears despised and basely cozen'd,31
And sent her enemies unto the grave.,31
The gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out,31
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.,31
I am the turned forth be it known to you,31
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,31
Alas you know I am no vaunter I;,31
That my report is just and full of truth.,31
Citing my worthless praise: O pardon me;,31
Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:,31
Of this was Tamora delivered;,31
Chief architect and plotter of these woes:,31
And as he is to witness this is true.,31
These wrongs unspeakable past patience,31
Now you have heard the truth what say you Romans?,31
And from the place where you behold us now,31
Will hand in hand all headlong cast us down.,31
And make a mutual closure of our house.,31
Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall.,31
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,31
The common voice do cry it shall be so.,31
Go go into old Titus' sorrowful house,31
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,31
As punishment for his most wicked life.,31
LUCIUS MARCUS and the others descend,31
Thanks gentle Romans: may I govern so,31
But gentle people give me aim awhile,31
Stand all aloof: but uncle draw you near,31
O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,31
These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,31
Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss,31
O were the sum of these that I should pay,31
Come hither boy; come come and learn of us,31
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,31
Many a matter hath he told to thee,31
In that respect then like a loving child,31
Because kind nature doth require it so:,31
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;,31
O grandsire grandsire! even with all my heart,31
O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping;,31
Re-enter Attendants with AARON,31
Give sentence on this execrable wretch,31
Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him;,31
If any one relieves or pities him,31
Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.,31
I am no baby I that with base prayers,31
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did,31
If one good deed in all my life I did,31
Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,31
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith,31
As for that heinous tiger Tamora,31
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;,31
Her life was beast-like and devoid of pity;,31
See justice done on Aaron that damn'd Moor,31
Then afterwards to order well the state,31
Exeunt,31
PROLOGUE,32
The princes orgulous their high blood chafed,32
Fraught with the ministers and instruments,32
Their crownets regal from the Athenian bay,32
To ransack Troy within whose strong immures,32
With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.,32
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge,32
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch,32
Dardan and Tymbria Helias Chetas Troien,32
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,32
Now expectation tickling skittish spirits,32
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come,32
Of author's pen or actor's voice but suited,32
To tell you fair beholders that our play,32
Beginning in the middle starting thence away,32
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:,32
SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.,32
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:,32
That find such cruel battle here within?,32
Let him to field; Troilus alas! hath none.,32
The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,32
But I am weaker than a woman's tear,32
Less valiant than the virgin in the night,32
Well I have told you enough of this: for my part,32
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.,32
Ay the grinding; but you must tarry,32
Have I not tarried?,32
Still have I tarried.,32
hereafter' the kneading the making of the cake the,32
stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips.,32
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.,32
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts--,32
Well she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw,32
I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,32
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,32
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:,32
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.,32
well go to--there were no more comparison between,32
would not as they term it praise her: but I would,32
will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit but--,32
When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,32
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad,32
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart,32
Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand,32
Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure,32
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,32
But saying thus instead of oil and balm,32
The knife that made it.,32
Thou dost not speak so much.,32
if she be fair 'tis the better for her; an she be,32
Good Pandarus how now Pandarus!,32
her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and,32
What art thou angry Pandarus? what with me?,32
as Helen: an she were not kin to me she would be as,32
I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.,32
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to,32
I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,32
Pandarus--,32
Sweet Pandarus--,32
found it and there an end.,32
Peace you ungracious clamours! peace rude sounds!,32
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.,32
It is too starved a subject for my sword.,32
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;,32
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.,32
What Cressid is what Pandar and what we?,32
Between our Ilium and where she resides,32
Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar,32
Alarum. Enter AENEAS,32
Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,32
What news AEneas from the field to-day?,32
By whom AEneas?,32
Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;,32
Alarum,32
Better at home if 'would I might' were 'may.',32
In all swift haste.,32
Exeunt,32
Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER,32
Queen Hecuba and Helen.,32
Up to the eastern tower,32
To see the battle. Hector whose patience,32
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,32
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,32
Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw,32
What was his cause of anger?,32
A lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector;,32
Good; and what of him?,32
And stands alone.,32
This man lady hath robbed many beasts of their,32
churlish as the bear slow as the elephant: a man,32
valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with,32
hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he,32
cause and merry against the hair: he hath the,32
that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use,32
But how should this man that makes,32
They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and,32
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.,32
Madam your uncle Pandarus.,32
Hector's a gallant man.,32
What's that? what's that?,32
Good morrow cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?,32
were you at Ilium?,32
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector,32
up was she?,32
Even so: Hector was stirring early.,32
Was he angry?,32
True he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay,32
Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take,32
What is he angry too?,32
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.,32
man if you see him?,32
Well I say Troilus is Troilus.,32
No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.,32
Himself! Alas poor Troilus! I would he were.,32
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.,32
Himself! no he's not himself: would a' were,32
or end: well Troilus well: I would my heart were,32
Excuse me.,32
Pardon me pardon me.,32
tale when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not,32
He shall not need it if he have his own.,32
No matter.,32
Twould not become him; his own's better.,32
herself swore th' other day that Troilus for,32
not brown neither--,32
Faith to say truth brown and not brown.,32
She praised his complexion above Paris.,32
So he has.,32
him above his complexion is higher than his; he,32
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as,32
a copper nose.,32
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.,32
day into the compassed window--and you know he,32
Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his,32
Why he is very young: and yet will he within,32
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?,32
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--,32
Why you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling,32
O he smiles valiantly.,32
O yes an 'twere a cloud in autumn.,32
loves Troilus--,32
prove it so.,32
an addle egg.,32
head you would eat chickens i' the shell.,32
his chin: indeed she has a marvellous white hand I,32
Without the rack.,32
Alas poor chin! many a wart is richer.,32
that her eyes ran o'er.,32
And Cassandra laughed.,32
her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?,32
At what was all this laughing?,32
An't had been a green hair I should have laughed,32
They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.,32
Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your,32
This is her question.,32
fifty hairs' quoth he 'and one white: that white,32
Jupiter!' quoth she 'which of these hairs is Paris,32
out and give it him.' But there was such laughing!,32
rest so laughed that it passed.,32
Well cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.,32
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you an 'twere,32
And I'll spring up in his tears an 'twere a nettle,32
A retreat sounded,32
stand up here and see them as they pass toward,32
At your pleasure.,32
see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their,32
Speak not so loud.,32
That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of,32
Troilus; you shall see anon.,32
Who's that?,32
and he's a man good enough he's one o' the soundest,32
When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if,32
Will he give you the nod?,32
If he do the rich shall have more.,32
That's Hector that that look you that; there's a,32
niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's,32
O a brave man!,32
what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder do,32
there's laying on take't off who will as they say:,32
Be those with swords?,32
to him it's all one: by God's lid it does one's,32
PARIS passes,32
is't not? Why this is brave now. Who said he came,32
Helen's heart good now ha! Would I could see,32
HELENUS passes,32
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's,32
Can Helenus fight uncle?,32
marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the,32
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?,32
Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!,32
prince of chivalry!,32
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon,32
his helm more hacked than Hector's and how he looks,32
three and twenty. Go thy way Troilus go thy way!,32
he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?,32
change would give an eye to boot.,32
Forces pass,32
porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the,32
are gone: crows and daws crows and daws! I had,32
all Greece.,32
Achilles! a drayman a porter a very camel.,32
Well well!' why have you any discretion? have,32
birth beauty good shape discourse manhood,32
and such like the spice and salt that season a man?,32
in the pie for then the man's date's out.,32
lie.,32
defend my wiles; upon my secrecy to defend mine,32
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie at a,32
Say one of your watches.,32
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would,32
the blow; unless it swell past hiding and then it's,32
You are such another!,32
Sir my lord would instantly speak with you.,32
At your own house; there he unarms him.,32
Exit boy,32
Adieu uncle.,32
To bring uncle?,32
By the same token you are a bawd.,32
Words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice,32
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see,32
Yet hold I off. Women are angels wooing:,32
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:,32
That she was never yet that ever knew,32
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:,32
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,32
Exeunt,32
Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON NESTOR ULYSSES MENELAUS and others,32
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?,32
In all designs begun on earth below,32
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,32
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain,32
Nor princes is it matter new to us,32
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;,32
Whereof we have record trial did draw,32
And that unbodied figure of the thought,32
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,32
But the protractive trials of great Jove,32
The fineness of which metal is not found,32
The wise and fool the artist and unread,32
But in the wind and tempest of her frown,32
Puffing at all winnows the light away;,32
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.,32
Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply,32
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,32
Upon her patient breast making their way,32
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage,32
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,32
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat,32
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,32
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide,32
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze,32
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,32
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,32
Retorts to chiding fortune.,32
Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece,32
In whom the tempers and the minds of all,32
Besides the applause and approbation To which,32
most mighty for thy place and sway,32
And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life,32
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece,32
As venerable Nestor hatch'd in silver,32
On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears,32
Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak.,32
That matter needless of importless burden,32
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,32
Troy yet upon his basis had been down,32
But for these instances.,32
And look how many Grecian tents do stand,32
When that the general is not like the hive,32
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,32
The heavens themselves the planets and this centre,32
Insisture course proportion season form,32
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol,32
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye,32
And posts like the commandment of a king,32
In evil mixture to disorder wander,32
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!,32
Divert and crack rend and deracinate,32
Quite from their fixure! O when degree is shaked,32
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,32
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,32
Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels,32
Take but degree away untune that string,32
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters,32
And make a sop of all this solid globe:,32
And the rude son should strike his father dead:,32
Between whose endless jar justice resides,32
Then every thing includes itself in power,32
And appetite an universal wolf,32
Must make perforce an universal prey,32
This chaos when degree is suffocate,32
And this neglection of degree it is,32
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd,32
That next by him beneath; so every step,32
Of his superior grows to an envious fever,32
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,32
Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength.,32
The fever whereof all our power is sick.,32
What is the remedy?,32
The sinew and the forehand of our host,32
Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent,32
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day,32
And with ridiculous and awkward action,32
He pageants us. Sometime great Agamemnon,32
And like a strutting player whose conceit,32
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound,32
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming,32
Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,32
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,32
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;,32
Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,32
That's done as near as the extremest ends,32
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!,32
Arming to answer in a night alarm.',32
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,32
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport,32
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all,32
All our abilities gifts natures shapes,32
Achievements plots orders preventions,32
Success or loss what is or is not serves,32
And in the imitation of these twain--,32
With an imperial voice--many are infect.,32
In such a rein in full as proud a place,32
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,32
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,32
To weaken and discredit our exposure,32
They tax our policy and call it cowardice,32
Forestall prescience and esteem no act,32
That do contrive how many hands shall strike,32
Of their observant toil the enemies' weight--,32
They call this bed-work mappery closet-war;,32
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,32
Or those that with the fineness of their souls,32
Let this be granted and Achilles' horse,32
A tucket,32
From Troy.,32
What would you 'fore our tent?,32
Even this.,32
Do a fair message to his kingly ears?,32
Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice,32
Fair leave and large security. How may,32
Know them from eyes of other mortals?,32
Ay;,32
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush,32
The youthful Phoebus:,32
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?,32
Are ceremonious courtiers.,32
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:,32
Good arms strong joints true swords; and,32
Nothing so full of heart. But peace AEneas,32
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,32
But what the repining enemy commends,32
transcends.,32
Ay Greek that is my name.,32
Sir pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.,32
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:,32
To set his sense on the attentive bent,32
Speak frankly as the wind;,32
That thou shalt know. Trojan he is awake,32
Trumpet blow loud,32
And every Greek of mettle let him know,32
Trumpet sounds,32
A prince call'd Hector--Priam is his father--,32
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,32
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece,32
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,32
That loves his mistress more than in confession,32
And dare avow her beauty and her worth,32
Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks,32
He hath a lady wiser fairer truer,32
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call,32
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:,32
If none he'll say in Troy when he retires,32
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.,32
If none of them have soul in such a kind,32
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,32
If then one is or hath or means to be,32
Tell him of Nestor one that was a man,32
But if there be not in our Grecian host,32
To answer for his love tell him from me,32
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,32
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste,32
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.,32
Amen.,32
To our pavilion shall I lead you sir.,32
So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent:,32
And find the welcome of a noble foe.,32
Nestor!,32
I have a young conception in my brain;,32
What is't?,32
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride,32
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,32
To overbulk us all.,32
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,32
Relates in purpose only to Achilles.,32
Whose grossness little characters sum up:,32
But that Achilles were his brain as barren,32
Tis dry enough--will with great speed of judgment,32
Pointing on him.,32
Yes 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,32
If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,32
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute,32
Our imputation shall be oddly poised,32
Although particular shall give a scantling,32
And in such indexes although small pricks,32
The baby figure of the giant mass,32
He that meets Hector issues from our choice,32
Makes merit her election and doth boil,32
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,32
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?,32
In no less working than are swords and bows,32
Give pardon to my speech:,32
Let us like merchants show our foulest wares,32
The lustre of the better yet to show,32
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;,32
Are dogg'd with two strange followers.,32
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,32
But he already is too insolent;,32
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,32
Why then we did our main opinion crush,32
And by device let blockish Ajax draw,32
Give him allowance for the better man;,32
Who broils in loud applause and make him fall,32
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,32
Yet go we under our opinion still,32
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:,32
Ulysses,32
And I will give a taste of it forthwith,32
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone,32
Exeunt,32
SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.,32
Thersites!,32
generally?,32
And those boils did run? say so: did not the,32
Dog!,32
Thou bitch-wolf's son canst thou not hear?,32
Feel then.,32
beef-witted lord!,32
beat thee into handsomeness.,32
I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than,32
canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!,32
Dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus?,32
Thou art proclaimed a fool I think.,32
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had,32
loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in,32
I say the proclamation!,32
and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as,32
barkest at him.,32
Thou shouldest strike him.,32
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a,32
[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!,32
Thou stool for a witch!,32
more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego,32
here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and,32
If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and,32
bowels thou!,32
You scurvy lord!,32
Mars his idiot! do rudeness; do camel; do do.,32
Why how now Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,32
You see him there do you?,32
Nay look upon him.,32
Nay but regard him well.,32
But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you,32
I know that fool.,32
Therefore I beat thee.,32
evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his,32
nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not,32
Achilles Ajax who wears his wit in his belly and,32
him.,32
I say this Ajax--,32
Nay good Ajax.,32
Nay I must hold you.,32
comes to fight.,32
I would have peace and quietness but the fool will,32
O thou damned cur! I shall--,32
No I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.,32
What's the quarrel?,32
proclamation and he rails upon me.,32
Well go to go to.,32
Your last service was sufferance 'twas not,32
here the voluntary and you as under an impress.,32
sinews or else there be liars. Hector have a great,32
were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.,32
There's Ulysses and old Nestor whose wit was mouldy,32
like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.,32
Yes good sooth: to Achilles! to Ajax! to!,32
Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou,32
No more words Thersites; peace!,32
There's for you Patroclus.,32
any more to your tents: I will keep where there is,32
Exit,32
Marry this sir is proclaim'd through all our host:,32
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy,32
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare,32
Farewell. Who shall answer him?,32
He knew his man.,32
Exeunt,32
Enter PRIAM HECTOR TROILUS PARIS and HELENUS,32
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:,32
As honour loss of time travail expense,32
In hot digestion of this cormorant war--,32
Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,32
Yet dread Priam,32
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,32
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,32
The beacon of the wise the tent that searches,32
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,32
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean of ours:,32
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,32
What merit's in that reason which denies,32
Fie fie my brother!,32
So great as our dread father in a scale,32
The past proportion of his infinite?,32
With spans and inches so diminutive,32
No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,32
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,32
You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest;,32
your reasons:,32
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,32
Who marvels then when Helenus beholds,32
The very wings of reason to his heels,32
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay if we talk of reason,32
Should have hare-hearts would they but fat,32
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect,32
Brother she is not worth what she doth cost,32
What is aught but as 'tis valued?,32
It holds his estimate and dignity,32
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry,32
And the will dotes that is attributive,32
Without some image of the affected merit.,32
Is led on in the conduct of my will;,32
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores,32
Although my will distaste what it elected,32
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:,32
When we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands,32
Because we now are full. It was thought meet,32
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;,32
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,32
He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness,32
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:,32
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,32
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--,32
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--,32
And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now,32
And do a deed that fortune never did,32
Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,32
But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n,32
We fear to warrant in our native place!,32
What noise? what shriek is this?,32
[Within]  Cry Trojans!,32
Enter CASSANDRA raving,32
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.,32
Virgins and boys mid-age and wrinkled eld,32
Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes,32
Cry Trojans cry! practise your eyes with tears!,32
Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all.,32
Cry cry! Troy burns or else let Helen go.,32
Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains,32
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood,32
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,32
Why brother Hector,32
Such and no other than event doth form it,32
Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures,32
Which hath our several honours all engaged,32
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:,32
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen,32
Else might the world convince of levity,32
But I attest the gods your full consent,32
All fears attending on so dire a project.,32
What Propugnation is in one man's valour,32
This quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,32
And had as ample power as I have will,32
Nor faint in the pursuit.,32
Like one besotted on your sweet delights:,32
So to be valiant is no praise at all.,32
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;,32
Wiped off in honourable keeping her.,32
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,32
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be,32
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?,32
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw,32
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed,32
Well may we fight for her whom we know well,32
Paris and Troilus you have both said well,32
Have glozed but superficially: not much,32
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:,32
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood,32
Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge,32
Of any true decision. Nature craves,32
What nearer debt in all humanity,32
Of nature be corrupted through affection,32
To their benumbed wills resist the same,32
To curb those raging appetites that are,32
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,32
Of nature and of nations speak aloud,32
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,32
Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,32
In resolution to keep Helen still,32
Upon our joint and several dignities.,32
Were it not glory that we more affected,32
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood,32
She is a theme of honour and renown,32
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,32
For I presume brave Hector would not lose,32
As smiles upon the forehead of this action,32
I am yours,32
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst,32
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:,32
Whilst emulation in the army crept:,32
Exeunt,32
Enter THERSITES solus,32
thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He,32
would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,32
conjure and raise devils but I'll see some issue of,32
rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two,32
themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,32
Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy,32
than little wit from them that they have! which,32
scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly,32
cutting the web. After this the vengeance on the,32
methinks is the curse dependent on those that war,32
say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!,32
Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites come in and rail.,32
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but,32
curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in,32
discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy,32
out says thou art a fair corse I'll be sworn and,32
Amen. Where's Achilles?,32
Ay: the heavens hear me!,32
Who's there?,32
Where where? Art thou come? why my cheese my,32
my table so many meals? Come what's Agamemnon?,32
what's Achilles?,32
what's thyself?,32
what art thou?,32
O tell tell.,32
Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus',32
You rascal!,32
He is a privileged man. Proceed Thersites.,32
is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool.,32
Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;,32
Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and,32
Why am I a fool?,32
art. Look you who comes here?,32
Come in with me Thersites.,32
Here is such patchery such juggling and such,32
whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions,32
the subject! and war and lechery confound all!,32
Enter AGAMEMNON ULYSSES NESTOR DIOMEDES and AJAX,32
Within his tent; but ill disposed my lord.,32
He shent our messengers; and we lay by,32
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think,32
Or know not what we are.,32
Exit,32
He is not sick.,32
melancholy if you will favour the man; but by my,32
cause. A word my lord.,32
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?,32
Who Thersites?,32
Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument.,32
argument Achilles.,32
their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool,32
The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily,32
Re-enter PATROCLUS,32
The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy:,32
Achilles bids me say he is much sorry,32
Did move your greatness and this noble state,32
But for your health and your digestion sake,32
Hear you Patroclus:,32
But his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn,32
Much attribute he hath and much the reason,32
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,32
Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,32
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,32
And under-honest in self-assumption greater,32
than himself,32
Disguise the holy strength of their command,32
His humorous predominance; yea watch,32
The passage and whole carriage of this action,32
That if he overhold his price so much,32
Not portable lie under this report:,32
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give,32
I shall; and bring his answer presently.,32
In second voice we'll not be satisfied;,32
Exit ULYSSES,32
No more than what he thinks he is.,32
better man than I am?,32
Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?,32
wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether,32
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I,32
Your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the,32
his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle;,32
the deed in the praise.,32
Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?,32
Re-enter ULYSSES,32
What's his excuse?,32
But carries on the stream of his dispose,32
In will peculiar and in self-admission.,32
Untent his person and share the air with us?,32
He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,32
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth,32
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts,32
And batters down himself: what should I say?,32
Cry 'No recovery.',32
Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent:,32
At your request a little from himself.,32
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes,32
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam,32
Enter his thoughts save such as do revolve,32
Of that we hold an idol more than he?,32
Must not so stale his palm nobly acquired;,32
As amply titled as Achilles is,32
That were to enlard his fat already pride,32
With entertaining great Hyperion.,32
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.',32
vein of him.,32
this applause!,32
O no you shall not go.,32
Let me go to him.,32
A paltry insolent fellow!,32
Can he not be sociable?,32
I'll let his humours blood.,32
An all men were o' my mind--,32
A' should not bear it so a' should eat swords first:,32
An 'twould you'ld carry half.,32
I will knead him; I'll make him supple.,32
pour in pour in; his ambition is dry.,32
Our noble general do not do so.,32
Why 'tis this naming of him does him harm.,32
I will be silent.,32
He is not emulous as Achilles is.,32
A whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us!,32
What a vice were it in Ajax now--,32
Or covetous of praise--,32
Or strange or self-affected!,32
Praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck:,32
Thrice famed beyond all erudition:,32
Let Mars divide eternity in twain,32
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield,32
Which like a bourn a pale a shore confines,32
Instructed by the antiquary times,32
Put pardon father Nestor were your days,32
You should not have the eminence of him,32
Shall I call you father?,32
Be ruled by him Lord Ajax.,32
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general,32
Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow,32
And here's a lord--come knights from east to west,32
Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:,32
Exeunt,32
SCENE I. Troy. Priam's palace.,32
Friend you! pray you a word: do not you follow,32
Ay sir when he goes before me.,32
Sir I do depend upon the lord.,32
praise him.,32
You know me do you not?,32
Friend know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.,32
I do desire it.,32
Grace! not so friend: honour and lordship are my titles.,32
What music is this?,32
Know you the musicians?,32
Who play they to?,32
At whose pleasure friend,32
Command I mean friend.,32
Friend we understand not one another: I am too,32
do these men play?,32
of Paris my lord who's there in person; with him,32
invisible soul--,32
No sir Helen: could you not find out that by her,32
It should seem fellow that thou hast not seen the,32
Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault,32
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!,32
Fair be to you my lord and to all this fair,32
fairly guide them! especially to you fair queen!,32
Dear lord you are full of fair words.,32
prince here is good broken music.,32
shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out,32
of harmony.,32
O sir--,32
Well said my lord! well you say so in fits.,32
will you vouchsafe me a word?,32
sing certainly.,32
marry thus my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed,32
My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord--,32
affectionately to you--,32
our melancholy upon your head!,32
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.,32
in truth la. Nay I care not for such words; no,32
call for him at supper you will make his excuse.,32
What says my sweet queen my very very sweet queen?,32
Nay but my lord--,32
with you. You must not know where he sups.,32
No no no such matter; you are wide: come your,32
Well I'll make excuse.,32
your poor disposer's sick.,32
You spy! what do you spy? Come give me an,32
Why this is kindly done.,32
sweet queen.,32
He! no she'll none of him; they two are twain.,32
Come come I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing,32
Ay ay prithee now. By my troth sweet lord thou,32
Ay you may you may.,32
O Cupid Cupid Cupid!,32
Ay good now love love nothing but love.,32
Sings,32
For O love's bow,32
The shaft confounds,32
But tickles still the sore.,32
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,32
So dying love lives still:,32
Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!,32
In love i' faith to the very tip of the nose.,32
blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and hot,32
Is this the generation of love? hot blood hot,32
is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord who's,32
Hector Deiphobus Helenus Antenor and all the,32
but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my,32
He hangs the lip at something: you know all Lord Pandarus.,32
sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?,32
Farewell sweet queen.,32
I will sweet queen.,32
A retreat sounded,32
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen I must woo you,32
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,32
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more,32
Twill make us proud to be his servant Paris;,32
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,32
Sweet above thought I love thee.,32
SCENE II. The same. Pandarus' orchard.,32
How now! where's thy master? at my cousin,32
No sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.,32
Enter TROILUS,32
Sirrah walk off.,32
Have you seen my cousin?,32
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks,32
And give me swift transportance to those fields,32
Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,32
And fly with me to Cressid!,32
Exit,32
The imaginary relish is so sweet,32
When that the watery palate tastes indeed,32
Swooning destruction or some joy too fine,32
For the capacity of my ruder powers:,32
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;,32
The enemy flying.,32
She's making her ready she'll come straight: you,32
her wind so short as if she were frayed with a,32
villain: she fetches her breath as short as a,32
Exit,32
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;,32
Like vassalage at unawares encountering,32
Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA,32
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that,32
you must be watched ere you be made tame must you?,32
we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to,32
picture. Alas the day how loath you are to offend,32
So so; rub on and kiss the mistress. How now!,32
is sweet. Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere,32
ducks i' the river: go to go to.,32
Words pay no debts give her deeds: but she'll,32
activity in question. What billing again? Here's,32
Come in come in: I'll go get a fire.,32
Will you walk in my lord?,32
Wished my lord! The gods grant--O my lord!,32
abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet,32
More dregs than water if my fears have eyes.,32
Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer,32
fear the worst oft cures the worse.,32
pageant there is presented no monster.,32
Nothing but our undertakings; when we vow to weep,32
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition,32
This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will,32
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.,32
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never,32
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They,32
are they not monsters?,32
are tasted allow us as we prove; our head shall go,32
shall have a praise in present: we will not name,32
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus,32
shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can,32
Will you walk in my lord?,32
What blushing still? have you not done talking yet?,32
I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,32
flinch chide me for it.,32
firm faith.,32
though they be long ere they are wooed they are,32
they'll stick where they are thrown.,32
Prince Troilus I have loved you night and day,32
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?,32
With the first glance that ever--pardon me--,32
I love you now; but not till now so much,32
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown,32
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,32
But though I loved you well I woo'd you not;,32
Or that we women had men's privilege,32
For in this rapture I shall surely speak,32
Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws,32
And shall albeit sweet music issues thence.,32
My lord I do beseech you pardon me;,32
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?,32
Your leave sweet Cressid!,32
Pray you content you.,32
Sir mine own company.,32
Let me go and try:,32
But an unkind self that itself will leave,32
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.,32
Perchance my lord I show more craft than love;,32
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,32
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.,32
As if it can I will presume in you--,32
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,32
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!,32
That my integrity and truth to you,32
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;,32
I am as true as truth's simplicity,32
In that I'll war with you.,32
When right with right wars who shall be most right!,32
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,32
Want similes truth tired with iteration,32
As sun to day as turtle to her mate,32
Yet after all comparisons of truth,32
As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,32
Prophet may you be!,32
When time is old and hath forgot itself,32
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,32
To dusty nothing yet let memory,32
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false,32
As fox to lamb as wolf to heifer's calf,32
Yea' let them say to stick the heart of falsehood,32
Go to a bargain made: seal it seal it; I'll be the,32
If ever you prove false one to another since I have,32
pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end,32
constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids,32
Amen.,32
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a,32
pretty encounters press it to death: away!,32
Bed chamber Pandar to provide this gear!,32
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.,32
Now princes for the service I have done you,32
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind,32
I have abandon'd Troy left my possession,32
From certain and possess'd conveniences,32
That time acquaintance custom and condition,32
And here to do you service am become,32
I do beseech you as in way of taste,32
Out of those many register'd in promise,32
What wouldst thou of us Trojan? make demand.,32
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.,32
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,32
I know is such a wrest in their affairs,32
Wanting his manage; and they will almost,32
In change of him: let him be sent great princes,32
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,32
Let Diomedes bear him,32
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,32
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow,32
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden,32
Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS,32
Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:,32
As if he were forgot; and princes all,32
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me,32
If so I have derision medicinable,32
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:,32
To show itself but pride for supple knees,32
We'll execute your purpose and put on,32
So do each lord and either greet him not,32
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.,32
You know my mind I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.,32
Would you my lord aught with the general?,32
Nothing my lord.,32
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR,32
How do you? how do you?,32
What does the cuckold scorn me?,32
Good morrow Ajax.,32
Good morrow.,32
Exit,32
They pass by strangely: they were used to bend,32
To come as humbly as they used to creep,32
What am I poor of late?,32
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is,32
As feel in his own fall; for men like butterflies,32
And not a man for being simply man,32
That are without him as place riches favour,32
Which when they fall as being slippery standers,32
Do one pluck down another and together,32
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy,32
Save these men's looks; who do methinks find out,32
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;,32
How now Ulysses!,32
What are you reading?,32
Writes me: 'That man how dearly ever parted,32
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,32
As when his virtues shining upon others,32
To the first giver.',32
The beauty that is borne here in the face,32
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,32
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed,32
For speculation turns not to itself,32
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.,32
It is familiar--but at the author's drift;,32
That no man is the lord of any thing,32
Till he communicate his parts to others:,32
Till he behold them form'd in the applause,32
reverberates,32
Fronting the sun receives and renders back,32
And apprehended here immediately,32
Heavens what a man is there! a very horse,32
Most abject in regard and dear in use!,32
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--,32
Ajax renown'd. O heavens what some men do,32
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,32
How one man eats into another's pride,32
To see these Grecian lords!--why even already,32
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast,32
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me,32
Good word nor look: what are my deeds forgot?,32
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,32
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd,32
As done: perseverance dear my lord,32
Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail,32
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,32
For emulation hath a thousand sons,32
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,32
And leave you hindmost;,32
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,32
Though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours;,32
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,32
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,32
virtue seek,32
For beauty wit,32
Love friendship charity are subjects all,32
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,32
Though they are made and moulded of things past,32
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.,32
Then marvel not thou great and complete man,32
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye,32
And still it might and yet it may again,32
And case thy reputation in thy tent;,32
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves,32
Of this my privacy,32
But 'gainst your privacy,32
Tis known Achilles that you are in love,32
Ha! known!,32
The providence that's in a watchful state,32
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,32
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.,32
Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;,32
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:,32
As perfectly is ours as yours my lord;,32
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:,32
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,32
Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,32
Farewell my lord: I as your lover speak;,32
Exit,32
A woman impudent and mannish grown,32
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;,32
And your great love to me restrains you thus:,32
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,32
Be shook to air.,32
Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him.,32
My fame is shrewdly gored.,32
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:,32
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;,32
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.,32
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him,32
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,32
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,32
Even to my full of view.,32
A labour saved!,32
What?,32
How so?,32
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he,32
How can that be?,32
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no,32
bites his lip with a politic regard as who should,32
and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire,32
The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his,32
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,32
you of this man that takes me for the general? He's,32
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both,32
Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites.,32
answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his,32
Patroclus make demands to me you shall see the,32
To him Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the,32
to come unarmed to my tent and to procure,32
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured,32
et cetera. Do this.,32
Hum!,32
Ha!,32
Hum!,32
Agamemnon!,32
Ha!,32
God b' wi' you with all my heart.,32
If to-morrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will,32
ere he has me.,32
Fare you well with all my heart.,32
No but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in,32
not; but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo,32
Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.,32
capable creature.,32
And I myself see not the bottom of it.,32
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,32
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.,32
ACT IV,32
Enter from one side AENEAS and Servant with a  torch; from the other PARIS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR DIOMEDES and others with torches,32
It is the Lord AEneas.,32
Had I so good occasion to lie long,32
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.,32
A valiant Greek AEneas--take his hand--,32
You told how Diomed a whole week by days,32
Health to you valiant sir,32
But when I meet you arm'd as black defiance,32
The one and other Diomed embraces.,32
But when contention and occasion meet,32
With all my force pursuit and policy.,32
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,32
Welcome indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,32
The thing he means to kill more excellently.,32
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,32
But in mine emulous honour let him die,32
We know each other well.,32
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,32
What business lord so early?,32
His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek,32
For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid:,32
Haste there before us: I constantly do think--,32
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:,32
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear,32
That I assure you:,32
Than Cressid borne from Troy.,32
The bitter disposition of the time,32
Good morrow all.,32
And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true,32
Who in your thoughts merits fair Helen best,32
Both alike:,32
Not making any scruple of her soilure,32
And you as well to keep her that defend her,32
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:,32
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;,32
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:,32
But he as he the heavier for a whore.,32
She's bitter to her country: hear me Paris:,32
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple,32
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,32
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.,32
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:,32
We'll but commend what we intend to sell.,32
Exeunt,32
Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA,32
Then sweet my lord I'll call mine uncle down;,32
Trouble him not;,32
And give as soft attachment to thy senses,32
Good morrow then.,32
Are you a-weary of me?,32
Waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows,32
I would not from thee.,32
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays,32
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.,32
Prithee tarry:,32
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,32
there's one up.,32
It is your uncle.,32
I shall have such a life!,32
How now how now! how go maidenheads? Here you,32
Go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle!,32
To do what? to do what? let her say,32
Come come beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,32
Ha! ha! Alas poor wretch! ah poor capocchia!,32
man let it sleep? a bugbear take him!,32
Knocking within,32
My lord come you again into my chamber:,32
Ha ha!,32
Knocking within,32
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.,32
Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat,32
Enter AENEAS,32
Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,32
Is not Prince Troilus here?,32
Come he is here my lord; do not deny him:,32
Is he here say you? 'tis more than I know I'll,32
should he do here?,32
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him to be,32
fetch him hither; go.,32
How now! what's the matter?,32
My matter is so rash: there is at hand,32
The Grecian Diomed and our Antenor,32
Ere the first sacrifice within this hour,32
The Lady Cressida.,32
By Priam and the general state of Troy:,32
How my achievements mock me!,32
We met by chance; you did not find me here.,32
Have not more gift in taciturnity.,32
Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil,32
plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!,32
How now! what's the matter? who was here?,32
Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!,32
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!,32
Prithee get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been,32
gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!,32
what's the matter?,32
art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,32
twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.,32
Thou must.,32
I know no touch of consanguinity;,32
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!,32
If ever she leave Troilus! Time force and death,32
But the strong base and building of my love,32
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep--,32
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,32
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.,32
SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.,32
It is great morning and the hour prefix'd,32
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,32
And haste her to the purpose.,32
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:,32
Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus,32
Exit,32
And would as I shall pity I could help!,32
Exeunt,32
Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA,32
Why tell you me of moderation?,32
And violenteth in a sense as strong,32
If I could temporize with my affection,32
The like allayment could I give my grief.,32
No more my grief in such a precious loss.,32
Enter TROILUS,32
O Troilus! Troilus!,32
What a pair of spectacles is here!,32
--O heart heavy heart,32
where he answers again,32
By friendship nor by speaking.',32
nothing for we may live to have need of such a,32
Cressid I love thee in so strain'd a purity,32
More bright in zeal than the devotion which,32
Have the gods envy?,32
And is it true that I must go from Troy?,32
What and from Troilus too?,32
Is it possible?,32
Puts back leave-taking justles roughly by,32
Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents,32
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:,32
Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves,32
Injurious time now with a robber's haste,32
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,32
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,32
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.,32
Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so,32
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.,32
my heart will be blown up by the root.,32
I must then to the Grecians?,32
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!,32
Hear me my love: be thou but true of heart--,32
Nay we must use expostulation kindly,32
I speak not 'be thou true' as fearing thee,32
That there's no maculation in thy heart:,32
My sequent protestation; be thou true,32
O you shall be exposed my lord to dangers,32
And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.,32
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,32
But yet be true.,32
Hear while I speak it love:,32
They're loving well composed with gifts of nature,32
How novelty may move and parts with person,32
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin--,32
O heavens! you love me not.,32
In this I do not call your faith in question,32
Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk,32
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:,32
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil,32
Do you think I will?,32
But something may be done that we will not:,32
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,32
[Within]  Nay good my lord--,32
[Within]  Brother Troilus!,32
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.,32
Who I? alas it is my vice my fault:,32
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;,32
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.,32
Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.,32
Welcome Sir Diomed! here is the lady,32
At the port lord I'll give her to thy hand,32
Entreat her fair; and by my soul fair Greek,32
Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe,32
Fair Lady Cressid,32
The lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek,32
You shall be mistress and command him wholly.,32
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee,32
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises,32
I charge thee use her well even for my charge;,32
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,32
O be not moved Prince Troilus:,32
To be a speaker free; when I am hence,32
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth,32
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour 'no.',32
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.,32
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.,32
Trumpet within,32
How have we spent this morning!,32
That sore to ride before him to the field.,32
Let us make ready straight.,32
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:,32
On his fair worth and single chivalry.,32
SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.,32
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,32
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,32
May pierce the head of the great combatant,32
Thou trumpet there's my purse.,32
Blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek,32
Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;,32
Trumpet sounds,32
Tis but early days.,32
Tis he I ken the manner of his gait;,32
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.,32
Is this the Lady Cressid?,32
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet lady.,32
Yet is the kindness but particular;,32
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.,32
I'll take what winter from your lips fair lady:,32
I had good argument for kissing once.,32
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,32
O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns!,32
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this mine:,32
O this is trim!,32
I'll have my kiss sir. Lady by your leave.,32
Both take and give.,32
The kiss you take is better than you give;,32
I'll give you boot I'll give you three for one.,32
An odd man lady! every man is odd.,32
That you are odd and he is even with you.,32
No I'll be sworn.,32
May I sweet lady beg a kiss of you?,32
I do desire it.,32
Why then for Venus' sake give me a kiss,32
I am your debtor claim it when 'tis due.,32
Lady a word: I'll bring you to your father.,32
A woman of quick sense.,32
There's language in her eye her cheek her lip,32
At every joint and motive of her body.,32
That give accosting welcome ere it comes,32
To every ticklish reader! set them down,32
And daughters of the game.,32
The Trojans' trumpet.,32
Enter HECTOR armed; AENEAS TROILUS and other Trojans with Attendants,32
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose,32
Shall to the edge of all extremity,32
By any voice or order of the field?,32
Which way would Hector have it?,32
Tis done like Hector; but securely done,32
The knight opposed.,32
What is your name?,32
Therefore Achilles: but whate'er know this:,32
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;,32
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,32
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:,32
Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek,32
A maiden battle then? O I perceive you.,32
Here is Sir Diomed. Go gentle knight,32
Consent upon the order of their fight,32
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin,32
AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists,32
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?,32
Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word,32
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:,32
For what he has he gives what thinks he shows;,32
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;,32
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes,32
Is more vindicative than jealous love:,32
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.,32
Even to his inches and with private soul,32
Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight,32
Now Ajax hold thine own!,32
Awake thee!,32
You must no more.,32
Princes enough so please you.,32
As Hector pleases.,32
Thou art great lord my father's sister's son,32
The obligation of our blood forbids,32
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so,32
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg,32
Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister,32
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member,32
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay,32
My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword,32
By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms;,32
Cousin all honour to thee!,32
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:,32
A great addition earned in thy death.,32
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes,32
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.,32
What further you will do.,32
The issue is embracement: Ajax farewell.,32
As seld I have the chance--I would desire,32
Tis Agamemnon's wish and great Achilles,32
AEneas call my brother Troilus to me,32
To the expecters of our Trojan part;,32
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.,32
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;,32
Shall find him by his large and portly size.,32
That would be rid of such an enemy;,32
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks,32
But in this extant moment faith and troth,32
Bids thee with most divine integrity,32
I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon.,32
less to you.,32
You brace of warlike brothers welcome hither.,32
The noble Menelaus.,32
Mock not that I affect the untraded oath;,32
She's well but bade me not commend her to you.,32
O pardon; I offend.,32
Labouring for destiny make cruel way,32
As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed,32
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,32
That I have said to some my standers by,32
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,32
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;,32
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,32
But by great Mars the captain of us all,32
And worthy warrior welcome to our tents.,32
Let me embrace thee good old chronicle,32
Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee.,32
As they contend with thee in courtesy.,32
Ha!,32
Well welcome welcome! I have seen the time.,32
When we have here her base and pillar by us.,32
Ah sir there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,32
In Ilion on your Greekish embassy.,32
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;,32
Yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,32
I must not believe you:,32
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost,32
And that old common arbitrator Time,32
So to him we leave it.,32
After the general I beseech you next,32
I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou!,32
I have with exact view perused thee Hector,32
Is this Achilles?,32
Stand fair I pray thee: let me look on thee.,32
Nay I have done already.,32
As I would buy thee view thee limb by limb.,32
But there's more in me than thou understand'st.,32
Tell me you heavens in which part of his body,32
That I may give the local wound a name,32
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me heavens!,32
To answer such a question: stand again:,32
As to prenominate in nice conjecture,32
I tell thee yea.,32
I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;,32
But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,32
You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag;,32
But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,32
Do not chafe thee cousin:,32
Till accident or purpose bring you to't:,32
If you have stomach; the general state I fear,32
I pray you let us see you in the field:,32
The Grecians' cause.,32
To-morrow do I meet thee fell as death;,32
Thy hand upon that match.,32
There in the full convive we: afterwards,32
Concur together severally entreat him.,32
That this great soldier may his welcome know.,32
My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you,32
At Menelaus' tent most princely Troilus:,32
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,32
On the fair Cressid.,32
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,32
You shall command me sir.,32
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there,32
O sir to such as boasting show their scars,32
She was beloved she loved; she is and doth:,32
Exeunt,32
SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.,32
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,32
Patroclus let us feast him to the height.,32
Enter THERSITES,32
Thou crusty batch of nature what's the news?,32
of idiot worshippers here's a letter for thee.,32
Why thou full dish of fool from Troy.,32
The surgeon's box or the patient's wound.,32
Prithee be silent boy; I profit not by thy talk:,32
Male varlet you rogue! what's that?,32
of the south the guts-griping ruptures catarrhs,32
palsies raw eyes dirt-rotten livers wheezing,32
limekilns i' the palm incurable bone-ache and the,32
again such preposterous discoveries!,32
thou to curse thus?,32
Why no you ruinous butt you whoreson,32
No! why art thou then exasperate thou idle,32
flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal's,32
with such waterflies diminutives of nature!,32
Finch-egg!,32
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.,32
A token from her daughter my fair love,32
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:,32
My major vow lies here this I'll obey.,32
This night in banqueting must all be spent.,32
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS,32
may run mad; but if with too much brain and too,32
Here's Agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one,32
earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter,32
and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty,32
leg--to what form but that he is should wit larded,32
To an ass were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to,32
dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an,32
not care; but to be Menelaus I would conspire,32
were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse,32
spirits and fires!,32
We go wrong we go wrong.,32
There where we see the lights.,32
No not a whit.,32
Re-enter ACHILLES,32
So now fair prince of Troy I bid good night.,32
Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.,32
Good night sweet lord Menelaus.,32
sweet sewer.,32
That go or tarry.,32
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS,32
Keep Hector company an hour or two.,32
The tide whereof is now. Good night great Hector.,32
[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch; he goes to,32
I'll keep you company.,32
And so good night.,32
Come come enter my tent.,32
That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue a most,32
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend,32
but when he performs astronomers foretell it; it,32
borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his,32
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan,32
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!,32
SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.,32
What are you up here ho? speak.,32
Calchas I think. Where's your daughter?,32
Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES at a distance; after them THERSITES,32
Enter CRESSIDA,32
How now my charge!,32
Whispers,32
She will sing any man at first sight.,32
she's noted.,32
Remember! yes.,32
And let your mind be coupled with your words.,32
List.,32
Roguery!,32
I'll tell you what--,32
In faith I cannot: what would you have me do?,32
What did you swear you would bestow on me?,32
Bid me do any thing but that sweet Greek.,32
Hold patience!,32
Diomed--,32
Thy better must.,32
O plague and madness!,32
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself,32
The time right deadly; I beseech you go.,32
Nay good my lord go off:,32
I pray thee stay.,32
I pray you stay; by hell and all hell's torments,32
And so good night.,32
Doth that grieve thee?,32
Why how now lord!,32
I will be patient.,32
Foh foh! adieu; you palter.,32
You shake my lord at something: will you go?,32
She strokes his cheek!,32
Nay stay; by Jove I will not speak a word:,32
A guard of patience: stay a little while.,32
potato-finger tickles these together! Fry lechery fry!,32
In faith I will la; never trust me else.,32
I'll fetch you one.,32
You have sworn patience.,32
I will not be myself nor have cognition,32
Re-enter CRESSIDA,32
Here Diomed keep this sleeve.,32
My lord--,32
You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.,32
Whose was't?,32
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:,32
Now she sharpens: well said whetstone!,32
What this?,32
O all you gods! O pretty pretty pledge!,32
Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove,32
As I kiss thee. Nay do not snatch it from me;,32
I had your heart before this follows it.,32
You shall not have it Diomed; faith you shall not;,32
I will have this: whose was it?,32
Come tell me whose it was.,32
But now you have it take it.,32
By all Diana's waiting-women yond,32
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,32
Wert thou the devil and worest it on thy horn,32
Well well 'tis done 'tis past: and yet it is not;,32
Why then farewell;,32
You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,32
I do not like this fooling.,32
What shall I come? the hour?,32
Farewell till then.,32
Exit DIOMEDES,32
But with my heart the other eye doth see.,32
The error of our eye directs our mind:,32
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.,32
A proof of strength she could not publish more,32
All's done my lord.,32
Why stay we then?,32
Of every syllable that here was spoke.,32
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?,32
An esperance so obstinately strong,32
As if those organs had deceptious functions,32
Was Cressid here?,32
She was not sure.,32
Why my negation hath no taste of madness.,32
Let it not be believed for womanhood!,32
To stubborn critics apt without a theme,32
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.,32
Nothing at all unless that this were she.,32
This she? no this is Diomed's Cressida:,32
If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies,32
If there be rule in unity itself,32
That cause sets up with and against itself!,32
Without perdition and loss assume all reason,32
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight,32
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,32
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle,32
Instance O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;,32
Instance O instance! strong as heaven itself;,32
And with another knot five-finger-tied,32
The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics,32
May worthy Troilus be half attach'd,32
Ay Greek; and that shall be divulged well,32
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy,32
Hark Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,32
That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;,32
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout,32
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,32
In his descent than shall my prompted sword,32
He'll tickle it for his concupy.,32
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,32
O contain yourself,32
Enter AENEAS,32
Hector by this is arming him in Troy;,32
Have with you prince. My courteous lord adieu.,32
Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head!,32
Accept distracted thanks.,32
Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would,32
Patroclus will give me any thing for the,32
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.,32
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!,32
SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam's palace.,32
When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,32
Unarm unarm and do not fight to-day.,32
By all the everlasting gods I'll go!,32
No more I say.,32
Where is my brother Hector?,32
Consort with me in loud and dear petition,32
Of bloody turbulence and this whole night,32
O 'tis true.,32
No notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother.,32
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:,32
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.,32
To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,32
And rob in the behalf of charity.,32
But vows to every purpose must not hold:,32
Hold you still I say;,32
Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man,32
Enter TROILUS,32
Cassandra call my father to persuade.,32
No faith young Troilus; doff thy harness youth;,32
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,32
Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy,32
Brother you have a vice of mercy in you,32
What vice is that good Troilus? chide me for it.,32
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,32
O'tis fair play.,32
How now! how now!,32
Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,32
The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,32
Fie savage fie!,32
Troilus I would not have you fight to-day.,32
Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars,32
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,32
Not you my brother with your true sword drawn,32
But by my ruin.,32
Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast:,32
Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee,32
Come Hector come go back:,32
Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself,32
To tell thee that this day is ominous:,32
AEneas is a-field;,32
Even in the faith of valour to appear,32
Ay but thou shalt not go.,32
You know me dutiful; therefore dear sir,32
To take that course by your consent and voice,32
O Priam yield not to him!,32
Andromache I am offended with you:,32
Exit ANDROMACHE,32
Makes all these bodements.,32
Look how thou diest! look how thy eye turns pale!,32
Hark how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!,32
Behold distraction frenzy and amazement,32
And all cry Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!,32
Farewell: yet soft! Hector! take my leave:,32
Exit,32
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,32
Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!,32
They are at it hark! Proud Diomed believe,32
Enter PANDARUS,32
What now?,32
Let me read.,32
troubles me and the foolish fortune of this girl;,32
leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum,32
that unless a man were cursed I cannot tell what,32
Words words mere words no matter from the heart:,32
Tearing the letter,32
My love with words and errors still she feeds;,32
Exeunt severally,32
Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES,32
look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,32
sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see,32
loves the whore there might send that Greekish,32
dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeveless errand.,32
swearing rascals that stale old mouse-eaten dry,32
not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up in,32
as bad a kind Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax,32
to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim,32
Soft! here comes sleeve and t'other.,32
Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,32
Thou dost miscall retire:,32
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:,32
Hold thy whore Grecian!--now for thy whore,32
Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES fighting,32
What art thou Greek? art thou for Hector's match?,32
No no I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:,32
I do believe thee: live.,32
God-a-mercy that thou wilt believe me; but a,32
become of the wenching rogues? I think they have,32
miracle: yet in a sort lechery eats itself.,32
Exit,32
Enter DIOMEDES and a Servant,32
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:,32
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,32
I go my lord.,32
Enter AGAMEMNON,32
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon,32
And stands colossus-wise waving his beam,32
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,32
Patroclus ta'en or slain and Palamedes,32
Appals our numbers: haste we Diomed,32
Enter NESTOR,32
And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.,32
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,32
And there they fly or die like scaled sculls,32
And there the strawy Greeks ripe for his edge,32
Here there and every where he leaves and takes,32
That what he will he does and does so much,32
Enter ULYSSES,32
Is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance:,32
Together with his mangled Myrmidons,32
Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend,32
Roaring for Troilus who hath done to-day,32
Engaging and redeeming of himself,32
As if that luck in very spite of cunning,32
Enter AJAX,32
Exit,32
So so we draw together.,32
Where is this Hector?,32
Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:,32
Exeunt,32
Enter AJAX,32
Enter DIOMEDES,32
What wouldst thou?,32
Were I the general thou shouldst have my office,32
Enter TROILUS,32
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!,32
I'll fight with him alone: stand Diomed.,32
Come both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!,32
Enter HECTOR,32
Enter ACHILLES,32
Pause if thou wilt.,32
Be happy that my arms are out of use:,32
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;,32
Exit,32
I would have been much more a fresher man,32
Re-enter TROILUS,32
No by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,32
Or bring him off: fate hear me what I say!,32
Exit,32
Stand stand thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:,32
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,32
beast abide?,32
Exeunt,32
Enter ACHILLES with Myrmidons,32
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:,32
And when I have the bloody Hector found,32
In fellest manner execute your aims.,32
It is decreed Hector the great must die.,32
Enter MENELAUS and PARIS fighting: then THERSITES,32

game: ware horns ho!,32
Enter MARGARELON,32
What art thou?,32
I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard,32
in valour in every thing illegitimate. One bear will,32
Take heed the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the,32
farewell bastard.,32
The devil take thee coward!,32
SCENE VIII. Another part of the plains.,32
Most putrefied core so fair without,32
Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:,32
Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him,32
Look Hector how the sun begins to set;,32
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,32
I am unarm'd; forego this vantage Greek.,32
HECTOR falls,32
Here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone.,32
Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.',32
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.,32
The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,32
My half-supp'd sword that frankly would have fed,32
Sheathes his sword,32
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.,32
SCENE IX. Another part of the plains.,32
Hark! hark! what shout is that?,32
Within,32
The bruit is Hector's slain and by Achilles.,32
Great Hector was a man as good as he.,32
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.,32
Great Troy is ours and our sharp wars are ended.,32
SCENE X. Another part of the plains.,32
Stand ho! yet are we masters of the field:,32
Enter TROILUS,32
Hector! the gods forbid!,32
In beastly sort dragg'd through the shameful field.,32
Sit gods upon your thrones and smile at Troy!,32
And linger not our sure destructions on!,32
You understand me not that tell me so:,32
But dare all imminence that gods and men,32
Who shall tell Priam so or Hecuba?,32
Go in to Troy and say there Hector's dead:,32
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,32
Scare Troy out of itself. But march away:,32
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,32
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,32
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:,32
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.,32
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.,32
As TROILUS is going out enter from the other side PANDARUS,32
Hence broker-lackey! ignomy and shame,32
Exit,32
world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!,32
a-work and how ill requited! why should our,32
what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:,32
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;,32
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.,32
painted cloths.,32
Your eyes half out weep out at Pandar's fall;,32
Though not for me yet for your aching bones.,32
Some two months hence my will shall here be made:,32
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:,32
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.,32
ACT I,33
Enter DUKE ORSINO CURIO and other Lords; Musicians attending,33
Give me excess of it that surfeiting,33
That strain again! it had a dying fall:,33
That breathes upon a bank of violets,33
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.,33
That notwithstanding thy capacity,33
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,33
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy,33
Will you go hunt my lord?,33
The hart.,33
O when mine eyes did see Olivia first,33
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;,33
E'er since pursue me.,33
How now! what news from her?,33
But from her handmaid do return this answer:,33
Shall not behold her face at ample view;,33
And water once a day her chamber round,33
A brother's dead love which she would keep fresh,33
O she that hath a heart of that fine frame,33
How will she love when the rich golden shaft,33
That live in her; when liver brain and heart,33
Her sweet perfections with one self king!,33
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.,33
SCENE II. The sea-coast.,33
What country friends is this?,33
And what should I do in Illyria?,33
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you sailors?,33
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.,33
Assure yourself after our ship did split,33
Hung on our driving boat I saw your brother,33
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,33
Where like Arion on the dolphin's back,33
So long as I could see.,33
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,33
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?,33
Not three hours' travel from this very place.,33
A noble duke in nature as in name.,33
Orsino.,33
He was a bachelor then.,33
For but a month ago I went from hence,33
What great ones do the less will prattle of--,33
What's she?,33
That died some twelvemonth since then leaving her,33
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,33
And sight of men.,33
And might not be delivered to the world,33
What my estate is!,33
Because she will admit no kind of suit,33
There is a fair behavior in thee captain;,33
Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee,33
With this thy fair and outward character.,33
Conceal me what I am and be my aid,33
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:,33
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing,33
That will allow me very worth his service.,33
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.,33
When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see.,33
Exeunt,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA,33

Why let her except before excepted.,33

Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek?,33
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.,33
Why he has three thousand ducats a year.,33

By this hand they are scoundrels and subtractors,33
They that add moreover he's drunk nightly in your company.,33

that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn,33
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.,33
Sir Toby Belch! how now Sir Toby Belch!,33
Bless you fair shrew.,33
Accost Sir Andrew accost.,33
My niece's chambermaid.,33
My name is Mary sir.,33
You mistake knight; 'accost' is front her board,33
By my troth I would not undertake her in this,33
Fare you well gentlemen.,33
never draw sword again.,33
draw sword again. Fair lady do you think you have,33
Sir I have not you by the hand.,33
Now sir 'thought is free:' I pray you bring,33
Wherefore sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?,33
Why I think so: I am not such an ass but I can,33
A dry jest sir.,33
Ay sir I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,33
Exit,33
see thee so put down?,33
put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit,33
great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.,33
An I thought that I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home,33
Pourquoi my dear knight?,33
bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in,33
followed the arts!,33
Why would that have mended my hair?,33
But it becomes me well enough does't not?,33
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs,33
Faith I'll home to-morrow Sir Toby: your niece,33
she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.,33

strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques,33
Art thou good at these kickshawses knight?,33
degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare,33
What is thy excellence in a galliard knight?,33
And I can cut the mutton to't.,33
as any man in Illyria.,33
these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to,33
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in,33
so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What,33
I did think by the excellent constitution of thy,33
Ay 'tis strong and it does indifferent well in a,33
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?,33
No sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the,33
Exeunt,33
Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire,33

Who saw Cesario ho?,33
Stand you a while aloof Cesario,33
To thee the book even of my secret soul:,33
Be not denied access stand at her doors,33
Till thou have audience.,33
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow,33
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,33
Say I do speak with her my lord what then?,33
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:,33
She will attend it better in thy youth,33
I think not so my lord.,33
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,33
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe,33
And all is semblative a woman's part.,33
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;,33
When least in company. Prosper well in this,33
To call his fortunes thine.,33
To woo your lady:,33
yet a barful strife!,33
Exeunt,33
Enter MARIA and Clown,33

Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this,33
Make that good.,33
A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that,33
Where good Mistress Mary?,33
Well God give them wisdom that have it; and those,33
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,33
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,33
You are resolute then?,33
That if one break the other will hold; or if both,33
Apt in good faith; very apt. Well go thy way; if,33
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.,33
lady: make your excuse wisely you were best.,33
Wit an't be thy will put me into good fooling!,33
prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee may,33
Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.',33
God bless thee lady!,33
Do you not hear fellows? Take away the lady.,33
besides you grow dishonest.,33
will amend: for give the dry fool drink then is,33
himself; if he mend he is no longer dishonest; if,33
that's mended is but patched: virtue that,33
amends is but patched with virtue. If that this,33
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but,33
away the fool; therefore I say again take her away.,33
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady cucullus non,33
motley in my brain. Good madonna give me leave to,33
Can you do it?,33
Make your proof.,33
of virtue answer me.,33
Good madonna why mournest thou?,33
I think his soul is in hell madonna.,33
The more fool madonna to mourn for your brother's,33
What think you of this fool Malvolio? doth he not mend?,33
infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the,33
God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the,33
sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his,33
How say you to that Malvolio?,33
barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day,33
than a stone. Look you now he's out of his guard,33
him he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men,33
than the fools' zanies.,33
with a distempered appetite. To be generous,33

Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou,33
Re-enter MARIA,33
desires to speak with you.,33
I know not madam: 'tis a fair young man and well attended.,33
Sir Toby madam your kinsman.,33

Go you Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count I,33
Exit MALVOLIO,33

By mine honour half drunk. What is he at the gate cousin?,33
A gentleman! what gentleman?,33

Cousin cousin how have you come so early by this lethargy?,33
Ay marry what is he?,33

Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o' my,33

Re-enter MALVOLIO,33

comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,33
Tell him he shall not speak with me.,33
door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter to,33
What kind o' man is he?,33
What manner of man?,33
Of what personage and years is he?,33
a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod or a,33
in standing water between boy and man. He is very,33
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.,33
Gentlewoman my lady calls.,33
Re-enter MARIA,33
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.,33
The honourable lady of the house which is she?,33
Your will?,33
pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house,33
my speech for besides that it is excellently well,33
beauties let me sustain no scorn; I am very,33
Whence came you sir?,33
question's out of my part. Good gentle one give me,33
that I may proceed in my speech.,33
No my profound heart: and yet by the very fangs,33
the lady of the house?,33
Most certain if you are she you do usurp,33
to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will,33
the heart of my message.,33
Alas I took great pains to study it and 'tis poetical.,33
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,33
than to hear you. If you be not mad be gone; if,33
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.,33
No good swabber; I am to hull here a little,33
lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.,33
the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.,33
war no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my,33
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?,33
learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I,33
divinity to any other's profanation.,33
Exeunt MARIA and Attendants,33
Most sweet lady--,33
Where lies your text?,33
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?,33
O I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?,33
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate,33
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.,33
not well done?,33
Excellently done if God did all.,33
Tis beauty truly blent whose red and white,33
Lady you are the cruell'st she alive,33
And leave the world no copy.,33

labelled to my will: as item two lips,33
them; item one neck one chin and so forth. Were,33
I see you what you are you are too proud;,33
My lord and master loves you: O such love,33
The nonpareil of beauty!,33
With adorations fertile tears,33
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:,33
Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth;,33
And in dimension and the shape of nature,33
He might have took his answer long ago.,33
With such a suffering such a deadly life,33
I would not understand it.,33
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,33
Write loyal cantons of contemned love,33
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills,33
Cry out 'Olivia!' O You should not rest,33
But you should pity me!,33
What is your parentage?,33
I am a gentleman.,33
I cannot love him: let him send no more;,33
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:,33
I am no fee'd post lady; keep your purse:,33
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;,33
Placed in contempt! Farewell fair cruelty.,33
What is your parentage?',33
I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;,33
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:,33
Unless the master were the man. How now!,33
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections,33
To creep in at mine eyes. Well let it be.,33
Re-enter MALVOLIO,33
Run after that same peevish messenger,33
Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.,33
Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:,33
I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee Malvolio.,33
Exit,33
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.,33
What is decreed must be and be this so.,33
ACT II,33
Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN,33
By your patience no. My stars shine darkly over,33
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your,33
recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.,33
No sooth sir: my determinate voyage is mere,33
touch of modesty that you will not extort from me,33
me in manners the rather to express myself. You,33
which I called Roderigo. My father was that,33
of. He left behind him myself and a sister both,33
would we had so ended! but you sir altered that;,33
the sea was my sister drowned.,33
A lady sir though it was said she much resembled,33
though I could not with such estimable wonder,33
publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but,33
water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.,33
O good Antonio forgive me your trouble.,33
your servant.,33
kill him whom you have recovered desire it not.,33
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that,33
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.,33
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!,33
Else would I very shortly see thee there.,33
That danger shall seem sport and I will go.,33
SCENE II. A street.,33
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?,33
arrived but hither.,33
saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.,33
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:,33
come again in his affairs unless it be to report,33
She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.,33
will is it should be so returned: if it be worth,33
it his that finds it.,33
I left no ring with her: what means this lady?,33
She made good view of me; indeed so much,33
For she did speak in starts distractedly.,33
Invites me in this churlish messenger.,33
I am the man: if it be so as 'tis,33
Disguise I see thou art a wickedness,33
How easy is it for the proper-false,33
Alas our frailty is the cause not we!,33
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;,33
And she mistaken seems to dote on me.,33
My state is desperate for my master's love;,33
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!,33
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!,33
SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.,33
Approach Sir Andrew: not to be abed after,33
surgere' thou know'st--,33
late is to be up late.,33
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is,33
to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the,33
Faith so they say; but I think it rather consists,33
Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.,33
Enter Clown,33
How now my hearts! did you never see the picture,33
Welcome ass. Now let's have a catch.,33
had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,33
sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last,33
Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas,33
leman: hadst it?,33
is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand and the,33
Excellent! why this is the best fooling when all,33
Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.,33
Would you have a love-song or a song of good life?,33
Ay ay: I care not for good life.,33
O mistress mine where are you roaming?,33
That can sing both high and low:,33
Journeys end in lovers meeting,33
Excellent good i' faith.,33
[Sings],33
Present mirth hath present laughter;,33
In delay there lies no plenty;,33
Youth's a stuff will not endure.,33
A contagious breath.,33
To hear by the nose it is dulcet in contagion.,33
rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three,33
An you love me let's do't: I am dog at a catch.,33
Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.',33
constrained in't to call thee knave knight.,33
call me knave. Begin fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.',33
Good i' faith. Come begin.,33
Enter MARIA,33
have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him,33
My lady's a Cataian we are politicians Malvolio's,33
I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?,33
Sings,33
Beshrew me the knight's in admirable fooling.,33
I too: he does it with a better grace but I do it,33
[Sings]  'O the twelfth day of December'--,33
Enter MALVOLIO,33
no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like,33

of voice? Is there no respect of place persons nor,33
We did keep time sir in our catches. Sneck up!,33
tell you that though she harbours you as her,33
you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors you,33
you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid,33
Farewell dear heart since I must needs be gone.',33
His eyes do show his days are almost done.',33
But I will never die.',33
This is much credit to you.,33
What an if you do?',33
O no no no no you dare not.',33
steward? Dost thou think because thou art,33
Yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i' the,33
Thou'rt i' the right. Go sir rub your chain with,33
Mistress Mary if you prized my lady's favour at any,33
for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it by this hand.,33
Go shake your ears.,33
a-hungry to challenge him the field and then to,33
Do't knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll,33
Sweet Sir Toby be patient for tonight: since the,33
much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio let me,33
nayword and make him a common recreation do not,33
I know I can do it.,33
Marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan.,33
What for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,33
I have no exquisite reason for't but I have reason,33
The devil a puritan that he is or any thing,33
that cons state without book and utters it by great,33
crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is,33
him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find,33
What wilt thou do?,33
love; wherein by the colour of his beard the shape,33
of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find,33
like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we,33
Excellent! I smell a device.,33
He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop,33
love with him.,33
And your horse now would make him an ass.,33
O 'twill be admirable!,33
work with him. I will plant you two and let the,33
observe his construction of it. For this night to,33
Exit,33
Before me she's a good wench.,33
what o' that?,33
Let's to bed knight. Thou hadst need send for,33
If I cannot recover your niece I am a foul way out.,33
the end call me cut.,33
Come come I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late,33
Exeunt,33
Enter DUKE ORSINO VIOLA CURIO and others,33
Now good Cesario but that piece of song,33
Methought it did relieve my passion much,33
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:,33
He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it.,33
Feste the jester my lord; a fool that the lady,33
Seek him out and play the tune the while.,33
Come hither boy: if ever thou shalt love,33
For such as I am all true lovers are,33
Save in the constant image of the creature,33
It gives a very echo to the seat,33
Thou dost speak masterly:,33
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:,33
A little by your favour.,33
Of your complexion.,33
About your years my lord.,33
An elder than herself: so wears she to him,33
For boy however we do praise ourselves,33
More longing wavering sooner lost and worn,33
I think it well my lord.,33
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;,33
Being once display'd doth fall that very hour.,33
To die even when they to perfection grow!,33
O fellow come the song we had last night.,33
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,33
Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,33
Like the old age.,33
Ay; prithee sing.,33
SONG.,33
And in sad cypress let me be laid;,33
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.,33
O prepare it!,33
Did share it.,33
On my black coffin let there be strown;,33
My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:,33
Lay me O where,33
To weep there!,33
No pains sir: I take pleasure in singing sir.,33
Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another.,33
Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the,33
thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such,33
every thing and their intent every where; for that's,33
Exit,33
CURIO and Attendants retire,33
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:,33
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;,33
Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune;,33
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.,33
I cannot be so answer'd.,33
Say that some lady as perhaps there is,33
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;,33
There is no woman's sides,33
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart,33
Alas their love may be call'd appetite,33
That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt;,33
And can digest as much: make no compare,33
And that I owe Olivia.,33
What dost thou know?,33
In faith they are as true of heart as we.,33
As it might be perhaps were I a woman,33
And what's her history?,33
But let concealment like a worm i' the bud,33
And with a green and yellow melancholy,33
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?,33
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove,33
But died thy sister of her love my boy?,33
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.,33
Ay that's the theme.,33
My love can give no place bide no denay.,33
SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.,33
Come thy ways Signior Fabian.,33
let me be boiled to death with melancholy.,33
rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?,33
favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.,33
fool him black and blue: shall we not Sir Andrew?,33
Here comes the little villain.,33
How now my metal of India!,33
coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the,33
hour: observe him for the love of mockery; for I,33
him. Close in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,33
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.,33
Enter MALVOLIO,33
me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come,33
of my complexion. Besides she uses me with a more,33
What should I think on't?,33
O peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock,33
Slight I could so beat the rogue!,33
To be Count Malvolio!,33
Pistol him pistol him.,33
There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy,33
Fie on him Jezebel!,33
imagination blows him.,33
my state--,33
Calling my officers about me in my branched velvet,33
Olivia sleeping--,33
O peace peace!,33
demure travel of regard telling them I know my,33
kinsman Toby--,33
O peace peace peace! now now.,33
out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind,33
approaches; courtesies there to me--,33
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace.,33
smile with an austere regard of control--,33
Saying 'Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on,33
What what?,33
Out scab!,33
Besides you waste the treasure of your time with,33
That's me I warrant you.,33
I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.,33
Taking up the letter,33
O peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading,33
By my life this is my lady's hand these be her,33
great P's. It is in contempt of question her hand.,33
[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved this and my good,33
Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece with which she,33
This wins him liver and all.,33
Jove knows I love: But who?,33
No man must know.,33

Marry hang thee brock!,33
I may command where I adore;,33
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:,33
A fustian riddle!,33
M O A I doth sway my life.' Nay but first let,33
What dish o' poison has she dressed him!,33
I may command where I adore.' Why she may command,33
evident to any formal capacity; there is no,33
that alphabetical position portend? If I could make,33
I--,33
Sowter will cry upon't for all this though it be as,33
M--Malvolio; M--why that begins my name.,33
excellent at faults.,33
that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.,33
Ay or I'll cudgel him and make him cry O!,33
Ay an you had any eye behind you you might see,33
you.,33
yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for,33
here follows prose.,33
If this fall into thy hand revolve. In my stars I,33
are born great some achieve greatness and some,33
their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;,33
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be,33

thee a steward still the fellow of servants and,33
She that would alter services with thee,33
Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is,33
I will baffle Sir Toby I will wash off gross,33
I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade,33
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of,33
and in this she manifests herself to my love and,33
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will,33
cross-gartered even with the swiftness of putting,33
postscript.,33
Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou,33
thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my,33
Jove I thank thee: I will smile; I will do,33
Exit,33
of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.,33
So could I too.,33
Nor I neither.,33
Re-enter MARIA,33
Or o' mine either?,33
bond-slave?,33
Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when,33
Nay but say true; does it work upon him?,33
If you will then see the fruits of the sport mark,33
her in yellow stockings and 'tis a colour she,33
and he will smile upon her which will now be so,33
melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him,33
me.,33
I'll make one too.,33
ACT III,33
Enter VIOLA and Clown with a tabour,33
thy tabour?,33
Art thou a churchman?,33
I do live at my house and my house doth stand by,33
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a,33
tabour if thy tabour stand by the church.,33
but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the,33
Nay that's certain; they that dally nicely with,33
I would therefore my sister had had no name sir.,33
Why sir her name's a word; and to dally with that,33
are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.,33
Troth sir I can yield you none without words; and,33
reason with them.,33
Not so sir I do care for something; but in my,33
to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible.,33
No indeed sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she,33
fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to,33
her fool but her corrupter of words.,33
Foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun,33
the fool should be as oft with your master as with,33
Nay an thou pass upon me I'll no more with thee.,33
Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard!,33
one;,33
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy,33
Would not a pair of these have bred sir?,33
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to bring,33
I understand you sir; 'tis well begged.,33
a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is,33
come; who you are and what you would are out of my,33
Exit,33
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:,33
The quality of persons and the time,33
That comes before his eye. This is a practise,33
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW,33
And you sir.,33
Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.,33
Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous,33
I am bound to your niece sir; I mean she is the,33
Taste your legs sir; put them to motion.,33
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.,33
I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we,33
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA,33
odours on you!,33
My matter hath no voice to your own most pregnant,33
Odours' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em,33
Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing.,33
Give me your hand sir.,33
What is your name?,33
My servant sir! 'Twas never merry world,33
You're servant to the Count Orsino youth.,33
Your servant's servant is your servant madam.,33
Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me!,33
On his behalf.,33
I bade you never speak again of him:,33
I had rather hear you to solicit that,33
Dear lady--,33
After the last enchantment you did here,33
Myself my servant and I fear me you:,33
To force that on you in a shameful cunning,33
Have you not set mine honour at the stake,33
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving,33
Hideth my heart. So let me hear you speak.,33
That's a degree to love.,33
That very oft we pity enemies.,33
O world how apt the poor are to be proud!,33
To fall before the lion than the wolf!,33
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.,33
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,33
There lies your way due west.,33
Attend your ladyship!,33
Stay:,33
That you do think you are not what you are.,33
Then think you right: I am not what I am.,33
Would it be better madam than I am?,33
O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful,33
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon,33
Cesario by the roses of the spring,33
I love thee so that maugre all thy pride,33
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,33
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,33
By innocence I swear and by my youth,33
And that no woman has; nor never none,33
And so adieu good madam: never more,33
Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move,33
Exeunt,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and FABIAN,33
Thy reason dear venom give thy reason.,33
Marry I saw your niece do more favours to the,33
I saw't i' the orchard.,33
As plain as I see you now.,33
Slight will you make an ass o' me?,33
judgment and reason.,33
was a sailor.,33
to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to,33
You should then have accosted her; and with some,33
have banged the youth into dumbness. This was,33
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash,33
lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle,33
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.,33
I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a,33
Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of,33
with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall,33
love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's,33
There is no way but this Sir Andrew.,33
Go write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;,33
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:,33
amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of,33
bed of Ware in England set 'em down: go about it.,33
write with a goose-pen no matter: about it.,33
We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.,33
This is a dear manikin to you Sir Toby.,33
strong or so.,33
not deliver't?,33
youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes,33
opened and you find so much blood in his liver as,33
the anatomy.,33
great presage of cruelty.,33
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.,33
into stitches follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is,33
Christian that means to be saved by believing,33
of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.,33
Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school,33
murderer. He does obey every point of the letter,33
face into more lines than is in the new map with the,33
a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things,33
he'll smile and take't for a great favour.,33
Exeunt,33
Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO,33
But since you make your pleasure of your pains,33
I could not stay behind you: my desire,33
And not all love to see you though so much,33
But jealousy what might befall your travel,33
Unguided and unfriended often prove,33
The rather by these arguments of fear,33
My kind Antonio,33
And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turns,33
But were my worth as is my conscience firm,33
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?,33
I am not weary and 'tis long to night:,33
With the memorials and the things of fame,33
Would you'ld pardon me;,33
Once in a sea-fight 'gainst the count his galleys,33
That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.,33
The offence is not of such a bloody nature;,33
Might well have given us bloody argument.,33
What we took from them; which for traffic's sake,33
For which if I be lapsed in this place,33
Do not then walk too open.,33
In the south suburbs at the Elephant,33
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge,33
Why I your purse?,33
You have desire to purchase; and your store,33
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you,33
To the Elephant.,33
Exeunt,33
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA,33
How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?,33
I speak too loud.,33
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:,33
He's coming madam; but in very strange manner. He,33
Why what's the matter? does he rave?,33
ladyship were best to have some guard about you if,33
Go call him hither.,33
I am as mad as he,33
Re-enter MARIA with MALVOLIO,33
Sweet lady ho ho.,33
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.,33
obstruction in the blood this cross-gartering; but,33
with me as the very true sonnet is 'Please one and,33
Why how dost thou man? what is the matter with thee?,33
did come to his hands and commands shall be,33
Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio?,33
God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss,33
How do you Malvolio?,33
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?,33
What meanest thou by that Malvolio?,33
Ha!,33
What sayest thou?,33
Heaven restore thee!,33
Thy yellow stockings!,33
Cross-gartered!,33
Am I made?,33
Why this is very midsummer madness.,33
Madam the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is,33
attends your ladyship's pleasure.,33
Exit Servant,33
my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special,33
half of my dowry.,33
O ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than,33
the letter: she sends him on purpose that I may,33
in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough' says she;,33
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put,33
consequently sets down the manner how; as a sad,33
habit of some sir of note and so forth. I have,33
thankful! And when she went away now 'Let this,33

Which way is he in the name of sanctity? If all,33
himself possessed him yet I'll speak to him.,33
how is't with you man?,33

I tell you? Sir Toby my lady prays you to have a,33
Ah ha! does she so?,33

consider he's an enemy to mankind.,33
La you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes,33
Carry his water to the wise woman.,33

O Lord!,33

Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray.,33
No I warrant you he will not hear of godliness.,33

Exit,33

His very genius hath taken the infection of the device man.,33
Why we shall make him mad indeed.,33
Come we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My,33

More matter for a May morning.,33

Ay is't I warrant him: do but read.,33
Reads,33
Good and valiant.,33
why I do call thee so for I will show thee no reason for't.',33
[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia and in my,33
throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.',33

Exit,33
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good,33
lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this,33
terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a,33
word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report,33
youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous,33
This will so fright them both that they will kill,33
Re-enter OLIVIA with VIOLA,33
he take leave and presently after him.,33
for a challenge.,33
I have said too much unto a heart of stone,33
There's something in me that reproves my fault;,33
That it but mocks reproof.,33
Goes on my master's grief.,33
Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;,33
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,33
Nothing but this; your true love for my master.,33
Which I have given to you?,33
Well come again to-morrow: fare thee well:,33
Exit,33
Gentleman God save thee.,33
That defence thou hast betake thee to't: of what,33
not; but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as,33
dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for,33
You mistake sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel,33
any image of offence done to any man.,33
if you hold your life at any price betake you to,33
youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal.,33
He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on,33
brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and,33
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death,33
I will return again into the house and desire some,33
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on,33
of that quirk.,33
very competent injury: therefore get you on and,33
house unless you undertake that with me which with,33
or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you,33
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me,33
my offence to him is: it is something of my,33
I will do so. Signior Fabian stay you by this,33
Exit,33
I know the knight is incensed against you even to a,33
I beseech you what manner of man is he?,33
his form as you are like to find him in the proof,33
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly,33
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I,33
I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that,33
care not who knows so much of my mettle.,33
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH with SIR ANDREW,33
firago. I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and,33
motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer he,33
step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.,33
Ay but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can,33
Plague on't an I thought he had been valiant and so,33
have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,33
I'll make the motion: stand here make a good show,33
Aside,33
Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA,33
I have his horse to take up the quarrel:,33
He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and,33
[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy sir; he will fight,33
bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now,33
the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.,33
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.,33
Come Sir Andrew there's no remedy; the gentleman,33
he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has,33
will not hurt you. Come on; to't.,33
I do assure you 'tis against my will.,33
Enter ANTONIO,33
Have done offence I take the fault on me:,33
You sir! why what are you?,33
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.,33
They draw,33
O good Sir Toby hold! here come the officers.,33
Pray sir put your sword up if you please.,33
I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily,33
This is the man; do thy office.,33
You do mistake me sir.,33
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.,33
I must obey.,33
This comes with seeking you:,33
What will you do now my necessity,33
Much more for what I cannot do for you,33
But be of comfort.,33
I must entreat of you some of that money.,33
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,33
Out of my lean and low ability,33
I'll make division of my present with you:,33
Will you deny me now?,33
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,33
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses,33
I know of none;,33
I hate ingratitude more in a man,33
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption,33
O heavens themselves!,33
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here,33
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,33
Most venerable worth did I devotion.,33
But O how vile an idol proves this god,33
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;,33
Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil,33
The man grows mad: away with him! Come come sir.,33
Exit with Officers,33
That he believes himself: so do not I.,33
That I dear brother be now ta'en for you!,33
whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.,33
Yet living in my glass; even such and so,33
Still in this fashion colour ornament,33
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.,33
A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than,33
friend here in necessity and denying him; and for,33
A coward a most devout coward religious in it.,33
Do; cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword.,33
Come let's see the event.,33
Exeunt,33
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.,33
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?,33
Let me be clear of thee.,33
I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come,33
nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.,33
know'st not me.,33
great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my,33
will prove a cockney. I prithee now ungird thy,33
lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?,33
money for thee: if you tarry longer I shall give,33
By my troth thou hast an open hand. These wise men,33
report--after fourteen years' purchase.,33
Now sir have I met you again? there's for you.,33
the people mad?,33
This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be,33
Exit,33
Nay let him alone: I'll go another way to work,33
him if there be any law in Illyria: though I,33
Let go thy hand.,33
soldier put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.,33
thou darest tempt me further draw thy sword.,33
of this malapert blood from you.,33
Hold Toby; on thy life I charge thee hold!,33
Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,33
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!,33
Rudesby be gone!,33
I prithee gentle friend,33
In this uncivil and thou unjust extent,33
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks,33
Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:,33
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.,33
Or I am mad or else this is a dream:,33
If it be thus to dream still let me sleep!,33
Madam I will.,33
Exeunt,33
Enter MARIA and Clown,33
make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do,33
Exit,33
in't; and I would I were the first that ever,33
become the function well nor lean enough to be,33
and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA,33
Bonos dies Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of,33
said to a niece of King Gorboduc 'That that is is;',33
what is 'that' but 'that' and 'is' but 'is'?,33
What ho I say! peace in this prison!,33
[Within]  Who calls there?,33
the lunatic.,33
Out hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!,33
Well said Master Parson.,33
Topas do not think I am mad: they have laid me,33
Fie thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most,33
that will use the devil himself with courtesy:,33
As hell Sir Topas.,33
and the clearstores toward the south north are as,33
obstruction?,33
Madman thou errest: I say there is no darkness,33
the Egyptians in their fog.,33
ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there,33
are: make the trial of it in any constant question.,33
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.,33
I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion.,33
thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will,33
thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.,33
My most exquisite Sir Topas!,33
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and,33
To him in thine own voice and bring me word how,33
knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered I,33
my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this,33
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA,33
Hey Robin jolly Robin,33
Fool!,33
Fool!,33
Fool I say!,33
Good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my,33
as I am a gentleman I will live to be thankful to,33
Master Malvolio?,33
Alas sir how fell you besides your five wits?,33
am as well in my wits fool as thou art.,33
better in your wits than a fool.,33
send ministers to me asses and do all they can to,33
Advise you what you say; the minister is here.,33
endeavour thyself to sleep and leave thy vain,33
Sir Topas!,33
sir? not I sir. God be wi' you good Sir Topas.,33
Fool fool fool I say!,33
shent for speaking to you.,33
tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.,33
By this hand I am. Good fool some ink paper and,33
it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing,33
I will help you to't. But tell me true are you,33
Believe me I am not; I tell thee true.,33
brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.,33
prithee be gone.,33
I am gone sir,33
I'll be with you again,33
Like to the old Vice,33
Who with dagger of lath,33
Cries ah ha! to the devil:,33
Pare thy nails dad;,33
Exit,33
Enter SEBASTIAN,33
This pearl she gave me I do feel't and see't;,33
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio then?,33
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,33
His counsel now might do me golden service;,33
That this may be some error but no madness,33
So far exceed all instance all discourse,33
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me,33
Or else the lady's mad; yet if 'twere so,33
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch,33
As I perceive she does: there's something in't,33
Enter OLIVIA and Priest,33
Now go with me and with this holy man,33
And underneath that consecrated roof,33
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul,33
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,33
According to my birth. What do you say?,33
And having sworn truth ever will be true.,33
That they may fairly note this act of mine!,33
ACT V,33
Enter Clown and FABIAN,33
Good Master Fabian grant me another request.,33
Do not desire to see this letter.,33
dog again.,33
Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends?,33
I know thee well; how dost thou my good fellow?,33
for my friends.,33
No sir the worse.,33
Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me;,33
my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,33
conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives,33
my friends and the better for my foes.,33
By my troth sir no; though it please you to be,33
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.,33
you could make it another.,33
Put your grace in your pocket sir for this once,33
Well I will be so much a sinner to be a,33
Primo secundo tertio is a good play; and the old,33
sir is a good tripping measure; or the bells of,33
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:,33
with her and bring her along with you it may awake,33
Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come,33
that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:,33
will awake it anon.,33
Here comes the man sir that did rescue me.,33
That face of his I do remember well;,33
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:,33
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;,33
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,33
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?,33
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;,33
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:,33
In private brabble did we apprehend him.,33
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:,33
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!,33
Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear,33
Orsino noble sir,33
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,33
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:,33
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth,33
His life I gave him and did thereto add,33
All his in dedication; for his sake,33
Into the danger of this adverse town;,33
Where being apprehended his false cunning,33
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,33
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,33
Not half an hour before.,33
When came he to this town?,33
No interim not a minute's vacancy,33
Enter OLIVIA and Attendants,33
But for thee fellow; fellow thy words are madness:,33
But more of that anon. Take him aside.,33
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?,33
Madam!,33
What do you say Cesario? Good my lord--,33
If it be aught to the old tune my lord,33
As howling after music.,33
Still so constant lord.,33
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars,33
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?,33
Why should I not had I the heart to do it,33
Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy,33
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,33
That screws me from my true place in your favour,33
But this your minion whom I know you love,33
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,33
Come boy with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:,33
To spite a raven's heart within a dove.,33
To do you rest a thousand deaths would die.,33
After him I love,33
More by all mores than e'er I shall love wife.,33
Punish my life for tainting of my love!,33
Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?,33
Call forth the holy father.,33
Whither my lord? Cesario husband stay.,33
Ay husband: can he that deny?,33
No my lord not I.,33
That makes thee strangle thy propriety:,33
Be that thou know'st thou art and then thou art,33
Enter Priest,33
Father I charge thee by thy reverence,33
To keep in darkness what occasion now,33
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.,33
Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,33
Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;,33
Seal'd in my function by my testimony:,33
I have travell'd but two hours.,33
When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?,33
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?,33
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.,33
O do not swear!,33
Enter SIR ANDREW,33
to Sir Toby.,33
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby,33
help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.,33
The count's gentleman one Cesario: we took him for,33
My gentleman Cesario?,33
nothing; and that that I did I was set on to do't,33
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:,33
But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not.,33
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.,33
Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:,33
tickled you othergates than he did.,33
That's all one: has hurt me and there's the end,33
O he's drunk Sir Toby an hour agone; his eyes,33
Then he's a rogue and a passy measures panyn: I,33
Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?,33
Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a,33
Get him to bed and let his hurt be look'd to.,33
Enter SEBASTIAN,33
But had it been the brother of my blood,33
You throw a strange regard upon me and by that,33
Pardon me sweet one even for the vows,33
One face one voice one habit and two persons,33
Antonio O my dear Antonio!,33
Since I have lost thee!,33
Fear'st thou that Antonio?,33
An apple cleft in two is not more twin,33
Most wonderful!,33
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,33
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.,33
What countryman? what name? what parentage?,33
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,33
If spirits can assume both form and suit,33
A spirit I am indeed;,33
Which from the womb I did participate.,33
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,33
My father had a mole upon his brow.,33
And died that day when Viola from her birth,33
O that record is lively in my soul!,33
That day that made my sister thirteen years.,33
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,33
Of place time fortune do cohere and jump,33
I'll bring you to a captain in this town,33
I was preserved to serve this noble count.,33
Hath been between this lady and this lord.,33
But nature to her bias drew in that.,33
Nor are you therein by my life deceived,33
Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.,33
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.,33
Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times,33
And all those sayings will I overswear;,33
As doth that orbed continent the fire,33
Give me thy hand;,33
The captain that did bring me first on shore,33
Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit,33
He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:,33
They say poor gentleman he's much distract.,33
A most extracting frenzy of mine own,33
How does he sirrah?,33
well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a,33
morning but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,33
Open't and read it.,33
the madman.,33
By the Lord madam'--,33
No madam I do but read madness: an your ladyship,33
Prithee read i' thy right wits.,33
read thus: therefore perpend my princess and give ear.,33
To FABIAN,33
world shall know it: though you have put me into,33
me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as,33
me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt,33
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little,33
THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.',33
Ay madam.,33
See him deliver'd Fabian; bring him hither.,33
My lord so please you these things further,33
To think me as well a sister as a wife,33
Here at my house and at my proper cost.,33
To VIOLA,33
So much against the mettle of your sex,33
And since you call'd me master for so long,33
Your master's mistress.,33
Re-enter FABIAN with MALVOLIO,33
Ay my lord this same.,33
Madam you have done me wrong,33
Have I Malvolio? no.,33
You must not now deny it is your hand:,33
Or say 'tis not your seal nor your invention:,33
And tell me in the modesty of honour,33
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,33
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;,33
Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,33
And made the most notorious geck and gull,33
Alas Malvolio this is not my writing,33
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.,33
First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,33
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee be content:,33
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,33
Of thine own cause.,33
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come,33
Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,33
Set this device against Malvolio here,33
We had conceived against him: Maria writ,33
In recompense whereof he hath married her.,33
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;,33
That have on both sides pass'd.,33
Why 'some are born great some achieve greatness,33
one sir in this interlude; one Sir Topas sir; but,33
But do you remember? 'Madam why laugh you at such,33
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.,33
Exit,33
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:,33
When that is known and golden time convents,33
Of our dear souls. Meantime sweet sister,33
For so you shall be while you are a man;,33
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.,33
[Sings],33
With hey ho the wind and the rain,33
For the rain it raineth every day.,33
With hey ho  and c.,33
For the rain  and c.,33
With hey ho  and c.,33
For the rain  and c.,33
With hey ho  and c.,33
For the rain  and c.,33
With hey ho  and c.,33
And we'll strive to please you every day.,33
ACT I,34
Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS,34
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.,34
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,34
To see the wonders of the world abroad,34
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.,34
Even as I would when I to love begin.,34
Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest,34
Wish me partaker in thy happiness,34
If ever danger do environ thee,34
For I will be thy beadsman Valentine.,34
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.,34
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.,34
For he was more than over shoes in love.,34
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.,34
No I will not for it boots thee not.,34
To be in love where scorn is bought with groans;,34
With twenty watchful weary tedious nights:,34
If lost why then a grievous labour won;,34
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.,34
So by your circumstance I fear you'll prove.,34
Love is your master for he masters you:,34
Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.,34
The eating canker dwells so eating love,34
And writers say as the most forward bud,34
Even so by love the young and tender wit,34
Losing his verdure even in the prime,34
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,34
Once more adieu! my father at the road,34
And thither will I bring thee Valentine.,34
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters,34
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;,34
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!,34
Exit,34
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,34
Thou Julia thou hast metamorphosed me,34
War with good counsel set the world at nought;,34
Enter SPEED,34
But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.,34
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.,34
An if the shepherd be a while away.,34
and I a sheep?,34
Why then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleep.,34
This proves me still a sheep.,34
Nay that I can deny by a circumstance.,34
The shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the,34
not me: therefore I am no sheep.,34
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for,34
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.,34
But dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?,34
a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a,34
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.,34
Nay: in that you are astray 'twere best pound you.,34
carrying your letter.,34
From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,34
your lover.,34
[First nodding]  Ay.,34
You mistook sir; I say she did nod: and you ask,34
And that set together is noddy.,34
take it for your pains.,34
Well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.,34
Marry sir the letter very orderly; having nothing,34
Beshrew me but you have a quick wit.,34
Come come open the matter in brief: what said she?,34
be both at once delivered.,34
Truly sir I think you'll hardly win her.,34
Sir I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,34
and being so hard to me that brought your mind I,34
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as,34
What said she? nothing?,34
testify your bounty I thank you you have testerned,34
letters yourself: and so sir I'll commend you to my master.,34
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,34
Exit SPEED,34
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,34
Exit,34
Enter JULlA and LUCETTA,34
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?,34
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen,34
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?,34
According to my shallow simple skill.,34
As of a knight well-spoken neat and fine;,34
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?,34
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?,34
How now! what means this passion at his name?,34
That I unworthy body as I am,34
Why not on Proteus as of all the rest?,34
Your reason?,34
I think him so because I think him so.,34
Ay if you thought your love not cast away.,34
Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye.,34
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.,34
O they love least that let men know their love.,34
Peruse this paper madam.,34
That the contents will show.,34
Valentine's page; and sent I think from Proteus.,34
Did in your name receive it: pardon the,34
Now by my modesty a goodly broker!,34
To whisper and conspire against my youth?,34
And you an officer fit for the place.,34
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.,34
That you may ruminate.,34
And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:,34
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.,34
And would not force the letter to my view!,34
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.',34
That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,34
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,34
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,34
My penance is to call Lucetta back,34
What ho! Lucetta!,34
What would your ladyship?,34
I would it were,34
And not upon your maid.,34
Nothing.,34
To take a paper up that I let fall.,34
Nothing concerning me.,34
Madam it will not lie where it concerns,34
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.,34
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.,34
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.',34
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?,34
And why not you?,34
Let's see your song. How now minion!,34
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.,34
No madam; it is too sharp.,34
Nay now you are too flat,34
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.,34
Indeed I bid the base for Proteus.,34
Here is a coil with protestation!,34
Go get you gone and let the papers lie:,34
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased,34
Exit,34
O hateful hands to tear such loving words!,34
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!,34
Look here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!,34
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,34
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.',34
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;,34
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.,34
Till I have found each letter in the letter,34
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock,34
Lo here in one line is his name twice writ,34
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.,34
He couples it to his complaining names.,34
Now kiss embrace contend do what you will.,34
Madam,34
Well let us go.,34
If you respect them best to take them up.,34
Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold.,34
Ay madam you may say what sights you see;,34
Come come; will't please you go?,34
SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.,34
Tell me Panthino what sad talk was that,34
Twas of his nephew Proteus your son.,34
He wonder'd that your lordship,34
While other men of slender reputation,34
Some to the wars to try their fortune there;,34
Some to the studious universities.,34
He said that Proteus your son was meet,34
To let him spend his time no more at home,34
In having known no travel in his youth.,34
Whereon this month I have been hammering.,34
And how he cannot be a perfect man,34
Experience is by industry achieved,34
Then tell me whither were I best to send him?,34
How his companion youthful Valentine,34
I know it well.,34
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,34
And be in eye of every exercise,34
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:,34
The execution of it shall make known.,34
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.,34
With other gentlemen of good esteem,34
And to commend their service to his will.,34
And in good time! now will we break with him.,34
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!,34
Here is her oath for love her honour's pawn.,34
To seal our happiness with their consents!,34
How now! what letter are you reading there?,34
Of commendations sent from Valentine,34
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.,34
How happily he lives how well beloved,34
Wishing me with him partner of his fortune.,34
As one relying on your lordship's will,34
My will is something sorted with his wish.,34
For what I will I will and there an end.,34
With Valentinus in the emperor's court:,34
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.,34
Excuse it not for I am peremptory.,34
Please you deliberate a day or two.,34
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.,34
To hasten on his expedition.,34
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,34
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,34
And with the vantage of mine own excuse,34
O how this spring of love resembleth,34
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,34
Re-enter PANTHINO,34
He is in haste; therefore I pray you to go.,34
And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.',34
ACT II,34
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED,34
Not mine; my gloves are on.,34
Ha! let me see: ay give it me it's mine:,34
Ah Silvia Silvia!,34
How now sirrah?,34
Why sir who bade you call her?,34
Well you'll still be too forward.,34
Go to sir: tell me do you know Madam Silvia?,34
Why how know you that I am in love?,34
learned like Sir Proteus to wreathe your arms,34
robin-redbreast; to walk alone like one that had,34
lost his A B C; to weep like a young wench that had,34
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to,34
wont when you laughed to crow like a cock; when you,34
fasted it was presently after dinner; when you,34
are metamorphosed with a mistress that when I look,34
Are all these things perceived in me?,34
Without me? they cannot.,34
were so simple none else would: but you are so,34
you and shine through you like the water in an,34
physician to comment on your malady.,34
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?,34
Why sir I know her not.,34
knowest her not?,34
Not so fair boy as well-favoured.,34
What dost thou know?,34
I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite.,34
of all count.,34
Marry sir so painted to make her fair that no,34
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.,34
How long hath she been deformed?,34
I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I,34
If you love her you cannot see her.,34
Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes;,34
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going,34
What should I see then?,34
for he being in love could not see to garter his,34
Belike boy then you are in love; for last,34
True sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,34
bolder to chide you for yours.,34
I would you were set so your affection would cease.,34
one she loves.,34
I have.,34
No boy but as well as I can do them. Peace!,34
[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!,34
Enter SILVIA,34
[Aside]  O give ye good even! here's a million of manners.,34
[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.,34
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;,34
But for my duty to your ladyship.,34
Now trust me madam it came hardly off;,34
I writ at random very doubtfully.,34
No madam; so it stead you I will write,34
A pretty period! Well I guess the sequel;,34
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,34
[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.',34
Yes yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;,34
Nay take them.,34
Ay ay: you writ them sir at my request;,34
I would have had them writ more movingly.,34
And when it's writ for my sake read it over,34
If it please me madam what then?,34
And so good morrow servant.,34
O jest unseen inscrutable invisible,34
My master sues to her and she hath,34
He being her pupil to become her tutor.,34
That my master being scribe to himself should write,34
How now sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?,34
To do what?,34
To whom?,34
What figure?,34
Why she hath not writ to me?,34
yourself? Why do you not perceive the jest?,34
No believing you indeed sir. But did you perceive,34
She gave me none except an angry word.,34
That's the letter I writ to her friend.,34
I would it were no worse.,34
For often have you writ to her and she in modesty,34
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,34
All this I speak in print for in print I found it.,34
I have dined.,34
feed on the air I am one that am nourished by my,34
your mistress; be moved be moved.,34
SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.,34
Have patience gentle Julia.,34
When possibly I can I will return.,34
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.,34
Why then we'll make exchange; here take you this.,34
Here is my hand for my true constancy;,34
Wherein I sigh not Julia for thy sake,34
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!,34
The tide is now: nay not thy tide of tears;,34
Julia farewell!,34
What gone without a word?,34
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.,34
Sir Proteus you are stay'd for.,34
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.,34
SCENE III. The same. A street.,34
Nay 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;,34
have received my proportion like the prodigious,34
court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured,34
wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat,34
perplexity yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed,34
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have,34
having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my,34
shoe is my father: no this left shoe is my father:,34
cannot be so neither: yes it is so it is so it,34
it is my mother and this my father; a vengeance,34
sister for look you she is as white as a lily and,34
am the dog: no the dog is himself and I am the,34
so. Now come I to my father; Father your blessing:,34
now should I kiss my father; well he weeps on. Now,34
like a wood woman! Well I kiss her; why there,34
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now,34
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.,34
Launce away away aboard! thy master is shipped,34
matter? why weepest thou man? Away ass! You'll,34
It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the,34
What's the unkindest tide?,34
Tut man I mean thou'lt lose the flood and in,34
thy voyage lose thy master and in losing thy,34
service--Why dost thou stop my mouth?,34
Where should I lose my tongue?,34
In thy tail!,34
the service and the tied! Why man if the river,34
wind were down I could drive the boat with my sighs.,34
Sir call me what thou darest.,34
Well I will go.,34
SCENE IV. Milan. The DUKE's palace.,34
Servant!,34
Master Sir Thurio frowns on you.,34
Not of you.,34
Twere good you knocked him.,34
Servant you are sad.,34
Seem you that you are not?,34
So do counterfeits.,34
What seem I that I am not?,34
What instance of the contrary?,34
And how quote you my folly?,34
My jerkin is a doublet.,34
How?,34
Give him leave madam; he is a kind of chameleon.,34
in your air.,34
Ay sir and done too for this time.,34
A fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off.,34
Who is that servant?,34
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,34
Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall,34
I know it well sir; you have an exchequer of words,34
followers for it appears by their bare liveries,34
No more gentlemen no more:--here comes my father.,34
Now daughter Silvia you are hard beset.,34
What say you to a letter from your friends,34
My lord I will be thankful.,34
Know ye Don Antonio your countryman?,34
To be of worth and worthy estimation,34
Hath he not a son?,34
The honour and regard of such a father.,34
I know him as myself; for from our infancy,34
And though myself have been an idle truant,34
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,34
Made use and fair advantage of his days;,34
His head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe;,34
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,34
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.,34
He is as worthy for an empress' love,34
Well sir this gentleman is come to me,34
And here he means to spend his time awhile:,34
Should I have wish'd a thing it had been he.,34
Silvia I speak to you and you Sir Thurio;,34
I will send him hither to you presently.,34
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship,34
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.,34
Upon some other pawn for fealty.,34
Nay then he should be blind; and being blind,34
Why lady Love hath twenty pair of eyes.,34
To see such lovers Thurio as yourself:,34
Have done have done; here comes the gentleman.,34
Enter PROTEUS,34
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.,34
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.,34
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.,34
Not so sweet  lady: but too mean a servant,34
Leave off discourse of disability:,34
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.,34
Servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress.,34
That you are welcome?,34
Re-enter THURIO,34
I wait upon his pleasure. Come Sir Thurio,34
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;,34
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.,34
Now tell me how do all from whence you came?,34
And how do yours?,34
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?,34
I know you joy not in a love discourse.,34
I have done penance for contemning Love,34
With bitter fasts with penitential groans,34
For in revenge of my contempt of love,34
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.,34
And hath so humbled me as I confess,34
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.,34
Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep,34
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.,34
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?,34
Call her divine.,34
O flatter me; for love delights in praises.,34
And I must minister the like to you.,34
Yet let her be a principality,34
Except my mistress.,34
Except thou wilt except against my love.,34
And I will help thee to prefer her too:,34
To bear my lady's train lest the base earth,34
And of so great a favour growing proud,34
And make rough winter everlastingly.,34
Pardon me Proteus: all I can is nothing,34
She is alone.,34
Not for the world: why man she is mine own,34
As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl,34
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,34
My foolish rival that her father likes,34
Is gone with her along and I must after,34
But she loves you?,34
marriage-hour,34
Determined of; how I must climb her window,34
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.,34
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.,34
I must unto the road to disembark,34
And then I'll presently attend you.,34
I will.,34
Even as one heat another heat expels,34
So the remembrance of my former love,34
Is it mine or Valentine's praise,34
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?,34
That I did love for now my love is thaw'd;,34
Bears no impression of the thing it was.,34
And that I love him not as I was wont.,34
And that's the reason I love him so little.,34
That thus without advice begin to love her!,34
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;,34
There is no reason but I shall be blind.,34
If not to compass her I'll use my skill.,34
SCENE V. The same. A street.,34
Launce! by mine honesty welcome to Milan!,34
welcome. I reckon this always that a man is never,34
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess,34
Come on you madcap I'll to the alehouse with you,34
shalt have five thousand welcomes. But sirrah how,34
Marry after they closed in earnest they parted very,34
But shall she marry him?,34
How then? shall he marry her?,34
What are they broken?,34
Why then how stands the matter with them?,34
stands well with her.,34
What a block art thou that thou canst not! My,34
What thou sayest?,34
and my staff understands me.,34
Why stand-under and under-stand is all one.,34
Ask my dog: if he say ay it will! if he say no,34
The conclusion is then that it will.,34
Tis well that I get it so. But Launce how sayest,34
I never knew him otherwise.,34
A notable lubber as thou reportest him to be.,34
Why fool I meant not thee; I meant thy master.,34
Why I tell thee I care not though he burn himself,34
if not thou art an Hebrew a Jew and not worth the,34
Why?,34
go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?,34
Exeunt,34
Enter PROTEUS,34
To love fair Silvia shall I be forsworn;,34
And even that power which gave me first my oath,34
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.,34
Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it!,34
But now I worship a celestial sun.,34
And he wants wit that wants resolved will,34
Fie fie unreverend tongue! to call her bad,34
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.,34
But there I leave to love where I should love.,34
If I keep them I needs must lose myself;,34
For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia.,34
For love is still most precious in itself;,34
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.,34
Remembering that my love to her is dead;,34
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.,34
Without some treachery used to Valentine.,34
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,34
Now presently I'll give her father notice,34
Who all enraged will banish Valentine;,34
But Valentine being gone I'll quickly cross,34
Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift,34
Exit,34
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA,34
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,34
Are visibly character'd and engraved,34
How with my honour I may undertake,34
Alas the way is wearisome and long!,34
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;,34
And when the flight is made to one so dear,34
Better forbear till Proteus make return.,34
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,34
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,34
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.,34
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,34
The more thou damm'st it up the more it burns.,34
Thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage;,34
He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,34
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,34
With willing sport to the wild ocean.,34
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,34
Till the last step have brought me to my love;,34
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.,34
Not like a woman; for I would prevent,34
Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds,34
Why then your ladyship must cut your hair.,34
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.,34
Of greater time than I shall show to be.,34
That fits as well as 'Tell me good my lord,34
Why even what fashion thou best likest Lucetta.,34
Out out Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.,34
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.,34
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.,34
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?,34
If you think so then stay at home and go not.,34
Then never dream on infamy but go.,34
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:,34
That is the least Lucetta of my fear:,34
And instances of infinite of love,34
All these are servants to deceitful men.,34
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth,34
His love sincere his thoughts immaculate,34
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.,34
Now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong,34
Only deserve my love by loving him;,34
To take a note of what I stand in need of,34
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,34
Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence.,34
I am impatient of my tarriance.,34
ACT III,34
Enter DUKE THURIO and PROTEUS,34
We have some secrets to confer about.,34
Now tell me Proteus what's your will with me?,34
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;,34
Done to me undeserving as I am,34
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.,34
This night intends to steal away your daughter:,34
I know you have determined to bestow her,34
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,34
Thus for my duty's sake I rather chose,34
Than by concealing it heap on your head,34
Being unprevented to your timeless grave.,34
Which to requite command me while I live.,34
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,34
Sir Valentine her company and my court:,34
And so unworthily disgrace the man,34
I gave him gentle looks thereby to find,34
And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,34
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,34
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.,34
How he her chamber-window will ascend,34
For which the youthful lover now is gone,34
Where if it please you you may intercept him.,34
That my discovery be not aimed at;,34
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.,34
That I had any light from thee of this.,34
Exit,34
Sir Valentine whither away so fast?,34
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,34
Be they of much import?,34
My health and happy being at your court.,34
I am to break with thee of some affairs,34
Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought,34
I know it well my Lord; and sure the match,34
Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities,34
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?,34
Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty,34
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;,34
Upon advice hath drawn my love from her;,34
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,34
And turn her out to who will take her in:,34
For me and my possessions she esteems not.,34
There is a lady in Verona here,34
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:,34
For long agone I have forgot to court;,34
How and which way I may bestow myself,34
Win her with gifts if she respect not words:,34
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.,34
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.,34
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.,34
But rather to beget more love in you:,34
For why the fools are mad if left alone.,34
For 'get you gone' she doth not mean 'away!',34
Though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces.,34
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.,34
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,34
That no man hath access by day to her.,34
Ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,34
What lets but one may enter at her window?,34
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it,34
Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords,34
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,34
Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,34
When would you use it? pray sir tell me that.,34
That longs for every thing that he can come by.,34
But hark thee; I will go to her alone:,34
It will be light my lord that you may bear it,34
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?,34
Then let me see thy cloak:,34
Why any cloak will serve the turn my lord.,34
I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me.,34
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.,34
Reads,34
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:,34
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!,34
While I their king that hither them importune,34
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:,34
That they should harbour where their lord would be.',34
Silvia this night I will enfranchise thee.',34
Why Phaeton--for thou art Merops' son--,34
And with thy daring folly burn the world?,34
Go base intruder! overweening slave!,34
And think my patience more than thy desert,34
Thank me for this more than for all the favours,34
But if thou linger in my territories,34
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,34
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.,34
But as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence.,34
And why not death rather than living torment?,34
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her,34
What light is light if Silvia be not seen?,34
Unless it be to think that she is by,34
Except I be by Silvia in the night,34
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,34
She is my essence and I leave to be,34
Foster'd illumined cherish'd kept alive.,34
Tarry I here I but attend on death:,34
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE,34
Soho soho!,34
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head,34
Valentine?,34
Who then? his spirit?,34
What then?,34
Can nothing speak? Master shall I strike?,34
Nothing.,34
Why sir I'll strike nothing: I pray you--,34
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,34
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,34
Is Silvia dead?,34
No Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia.,34
No Valentine.,34
What is your news?,34
That thou art banished--O that's the news!--,34
O I have fed upon this woe already,34
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?,34
Which unreversed stands in effectual force--,34
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;,34
Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them,34
But neither bended knees pure hands held up,34
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;,34
Besides her intercession chafed him so,34
That to close prison he commanded her,34
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st,34
If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,34
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,34
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.,34
Besides thy staying will abridge thy life.,34
And manage it against despairing thoughts.,34
Which being writ to me shall be deliver'd,34
The time now serves not to expostulate:,34
And ere I part with thee confer at large,34
As thou lovest Silvia though not for thyself,34
I pray thee Launce an if thou seest my boy,34
Go sirrah find him out. Come Valentine.,34
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS,34
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's,34
that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a,34
tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman I,34
tis not a maid for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis,34
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;,34
Pulling out a paper,34
Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why a horse,34
carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:,34
with clean hands.,34
How now Signior Launce! what news with your,34
With my master's ship? why it is at sea.,34
news then in your paper?,34
Why man how black?,34
Let me read them.,34
Thou liest; I can.,34
Marry the son of my grandfather.,34
grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.,34
There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!,34
Ay that she can.,34
And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your,34
Item: She can sew.',34
Item: She can knit.',34
she can knit him a stock?,34
A special virtue: for then she need not be washed,34
Item: She can spin.',34
spin for her living.,34
That's as much as to say bastard virtues; that,34
Here follow her vices.',34
Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect,34
Well that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.,34
That makes amends for her sour breath.,34
It's no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk.,34
O villain that set this down among her vices! To,34
thee out with't and place it for her chief virtue.,34
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy and cannot,34
Item: She hath no teeth.',34
Item: She is curst.',34
Item: She will often praise her liquor.',34
will; for good things should be praised.,34
Of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down she,34
I'll keep shut: now of another thing she may and,34
Item: She hath more hair than wit and more faults,34
Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine and not,34
Rehearse that once more.,34
More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The,34
is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit,34
less. What's next?,34
That's monstrous: O that that were out!,34
Why that word makes the faults gracious. Well,34
impossible--,34
Why then will I tell thee--that thy master stays,34
For me?,34
better man than thee.,34
Thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long,34
Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!,34
Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an,34
secrets! I'll after to rejoice in the boy's correction.,34
SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.,34
Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you,34
Since his exile she hath despised me most,34
That I am desperate of obtaining her.,34
Trenched in ice which with an hour's heat,34
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,34
Enter PROTEUS,34
According to our proclamation gone?,34
My daughter takes his going grievously.,34
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.,34
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--,34
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace,34
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect,34
I do my lord.,34
How she opposes her against my will,34
Ay and perversely she persevers so.,34
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?,34
With falsehood cowardice and poor descent,34
Ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.,34
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken,34
Then you must undertake to slander him.,34
Tis an ill office for a gentleman,34
Where your good word cannot advantage him,34
Therefore the office is indifferent,34
You have prevail'd my lord; if I can do it,34
She shall not long continue love to him.,34
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.,34
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,34
Which must be done by praising me as much,34
And Proteus we dare trust you in this kind,34
You are already Love's firm votary,34
Upon this warrant shall you have access,34
For she is lumpish heavy melancholy,34
Where you may temper her by your persuasion,34
As much as I can do I will effect:,34
You must lay lime to tangle her desires,34
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.,34
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.,34
You sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart:,34
Moist it again and frame some feeling line,34
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,34
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans,34
After your dire-lamenting elegies,34
With some sweet concert; to their instruments,34
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.,34
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.,34
Therefore sweet Proteus my direction-giver,34
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.,34
To give the onset to thy good advice.,34
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,34
Even now about it! I will pardon you.,34
ACT IV,34
Enter certain Outlaws,34
If there be ten shrink not but down with 'em.,34
Stand sir and throw us that you have about ye:,34
Sir we are undone; these are the villains,34
My friends--,34
Peace! we'll hear him.,34
Then know that I have little wealth to lose:,34
My riches are these poor habiliments,34
You take the sum and substance that I have.,34
To Verona.,34
From Milan.,34
Some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd,34
What were you banish'd thence?,34
For what offence?,34
I kill'd a man whose death I much repent;,34
Without false vantage or base treachery.,34
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?,34
Have you the tongues?,34
Or else I often had been miserable.,34
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!,34
Master be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.,34
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?,34
Know then that some of us are gentlemen,34
Thrust from the company of awful men:,34
For practising to steal away a lady,34
And I from Mantua for a gentleman,34
And I for such like petty crimes as these,34
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;,34
With goodly shape and by your own report,34
As we do in our quality much want--,34
Therefore above the rest we parley to you:,34
To make a virtue of necessity,34
What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?,34
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,34
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest.,34
I take your offer and will live with you,34
On silly women or poor passengers.,34
Come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews,34
Which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose.,34
SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace under SILVIA's chamber.,34
Already have I been false to Valentine,34
Under the colour of commending him,34
But Silvia is too fair too true too holy,34
When I protest true loyalty to her,34
When to her beauty I commend my vows,34
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:,34
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,34
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.,34
And give some evening music to her ear.,34
How now Sir Proteus are you crept before us?,34
Will creep in service where it cannot go.,34
Sir but I do; or else I would be hence.,34
Ay Silvia; for your sake.,34
Let's tune and to it lustily awhile.,34
Now my young guest methinks you're allycholly: I,34
Marry mine host because I cannot be merry.,34
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.,34
Ay that you shall.,34
Music plays,34
Is he among these?,34
SONG.,34
That all our swains commend her?,34
The heaven such grace did lend her,34
Is she kind as she is fair?,34
Love doth to her eyes repair,34
And being help'd inhabits there.,34
That Silvia is excelling;,34
Upon the dull earth dwelling:,34
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How,34
You mistake; the musician likes me not.,34
He plays false father.,34
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very,34
You have a quick ear.,34
I perceive you delight not in music.,34
Hark what fine change is in the music!,34
You would have them always play but one thing?,34
But host doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on,34
I tell you what Launce his man told me: he loved,34
Where is Launce?,34
master's command he must carry for a present to his lady.,34
Sir Thurio fear not you: I will so plead,34
Where meet we?,34
Farewell.,34
Enter SILVIA above,34
I thank you for your music gentlemen.,34
One lady if you knew his pure heart's truth,34
Sir Proteus as I take it.,34
What's your will?,34
You have your wish; my will is even this:,34
Thou subtle perjured false disloyal man!,34
To be seduced by thy flattery,34
Return return and make thy love amends.,34
I am so far from granting thy request,34
And by and by intend to chide myself,34
I grant sweet love that I did love a lady;,34
[Aside]        'Twere false if I should speak it;,34
Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend,34
I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed,34
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.,34
Assure thyself my love is buried.,34
Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,34
[Aside]  He heard not that.,34
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,34
To that I'll speak to that I'll sigh and weep:,34
Is else devoted I am but a shadow;,34
[Aside]  If 'twere a substance you would sure,34
And make it but a shadow as I am.,34
But since your falsehood shall become you well,34
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:,34
As wretches have o'ernight,34
Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally,34
By my halidom I was fast asleep.,34
Marry at my house. Trust me I think 'tis almost,34
Not so; but it hath been the longest night,34
Exeunt,34
Enter EGLAMOUR,34
Entreated me to call and know her mind:,34
Madam madam!,34
Who calls?,34
One that attends your ladyship's command.,34
As many worthy lady to yourself:,34
I am thus early come to know what service,34
O Eglamour thou art a gentleman--,34
Valiant wise remorseful well accomplish'd:,34
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,34
Vain Thurio whom my very soul abhors.,34
No grief did ever come so near thy heart,34
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.,34
To Mantua where I hear he makes abode;,34
I do desire thy worthy company,34
Urge not my father's anger Eglamour,34
And on the justice of my flying hence,34
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.,34
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,34
If not to hide what I have said to thee,34
Madam I pity much your grievances;,34
I give consent to go along with you,34
As much I wish all good befortune you.,34
This evening coming.,34
At Friar Patrick's cell,34
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow gentle lady.,34
Exeunt severally,34
Enter LAUNCE with his his Dog,34
look you it goes hard: one that I brought up of a,34
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.,34
thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver,34
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he,34
O 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself,34
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be,34
more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did,34
live he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He,34
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had,34
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says,34
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.,34
knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that,34
the dog?' 'Ay marry do I' quoth he. 'You do him,34
wot of.' He makes me no more ado but whips me out,34
his servant? Nay I'll be sworn I have sat in the,34
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese,34
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay I remember the,34
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I,34
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst,34
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA,34
And will employ thee in some service presently.,34
I hope thou wilt.,34
How now you whoreson peasant!,34
Marry sir I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.,34
Marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you,34
But she received my dog?,34
back again.,34
Ay sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by,34
offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of,34
Go get thee hence and find my dog again,34
Away I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?,34
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!,34
Partly that I have need of such a youth,34
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,34
Which if my augury deceive me not,34
Therefore know thou for this I entertain thee.,34
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:,34
It seems you loved not her to leave her token.,34
Not so; I think she lives.,34
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?,34
But pity her.,34
Because methinks that she loved you as well,34
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;,34
Tis pity love should be so contrary;,34
Well give her that ring and therewithal,34
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.,34
Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.,34
How many women would do such a message?,34
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.,34
That with his very heart despiseth me?,34
Because I love him I must pity him.,34
To bind him to remember my good will;,34
To plead for that which I would not obtain,34
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.,34
But cannot be true servant to my master,34
Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly,34
Enter SILVIA attended,34
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.,34
If you be she I do entreat your patience,34
From whom?,34
O he sends you for a picture.,34
Ursula bring my picture here.,34
One Julia that his changing thoughts forget,34
Madam please you peruse this letter.--,34
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:,34
I pray thee let me look on that again.,34
There hold!,34
I know they are stuff'd with protestations,34
As easily as I do tear his paper.,34
The more shame for him that he sends it me;,34
His Julia gave it him at his departure.,34
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.,34
What say'st thou?,34
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.,34
Almost as well as I do know myself:,34
That I have wept a hundred several times.,34
I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.,34
She hath been fairer madam than she is:,34
She in my judgment was as fair as you:,34
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,34
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,34
How tall was she?,34
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,34
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,34
As if the garment had been made for me:,34
And at that time I made her weep agood,34
Madam 'twas Ariadne passioning,34
Which I so lively acted with my tears,34
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead,34
She is beholding to thee gentle youth.,34
I weep myself to think upon thy words.,34
For thy sweet mistress' sake because thou lovest her.,34
Exit SILVIA with attendants,34
A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful,34
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.,34
Here is her picture: let me see; I think,34
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:,34
Unless I flatter with myself too much.,34
If that be all the difference in his love,34
Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine:,34
What should it be that he respects in her,34
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?,34
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,34
And were there sense in his idolatry,34
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,34
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,34
Exit,34
SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.,34
The sun begins to gild the western sky;,34
That Silvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me.,34
Unless it be to come before their time;,34
See where she comes.,34
Lady a happy evening!,34
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:,34
Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;,34
Exeunt,34
Enter THURIO PROTEUS and JULIA,34
O sir I find her milder than she was;,34
What that my leg is too long?,34
I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.,34
it loathes.,34
She says it is a fair one.,34
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,34
[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out,34
For I had rather wink than look on them.,34
Ill when you talk of war.,34
[Aside]  But better indeed when you hold your peace.,34
O sir she makes no doubt of that.,34
What says she to my birth?,34
[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.,34
O ay; and pities them.,34
[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.,34
Here comes the duke.,34
How now Sir Proteus! how now Thurio!,34
Not I.,34
Saw you my daughter?,34
Why then,34
And Eglamour is in her company.,34
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;,34
But being mask'd he was not sure of it;,34
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;,34
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,34
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot,34
Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me.,34
Why this it is to be a peevish girl,34
I'll after more to be revenged on Eglamour,34
Exit,34
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.,34
And I will follow more to cross that love,34
Exit,34
Enter Outlaws with SILVIA,34
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.,34
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.,34
Where is the gentleman that was with her?,34
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.,34
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;,34
Come I must bring you to our captain's cave:,34
And will not use a woman lawlessly.,34
Exeunt,34
Enter VALENTINE,34
This shadowy desert unfrequented woods,34
Here can I sit alone unseen of any,34
Tune my distresses and record my woes.,34
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,34
And leave no memory of what it was!,34
Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain!,34
These are my mates that make their wills their law,34
They love me well; yet I have much to do,34
Withdraw thee Valentine: who's this comes here?,34
Madam this service I have done for you,34
To hazard life and rescue you from him,34
Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look;,34
And less than this I am sure you cannot give.,34
Love lend me patience to forbear awhile.,34
Unhappy were you madam ere I came;,34
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.,34
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,34
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.,34
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!,34
I do detest false perjured Proteus.,34
What dangerous action stood it next to death,34
O 'tis the curse in love and still approved,34
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.,34
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith,34
Descended into perjury to love me.,34
And that's far worse than none; better have none,34
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!,34
Who respects friend?,34
Nay if the gentle spirit of moving words,34
I'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end,34
O heaven!,34
Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch,34
Valentine!,34
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!,34
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say,34
Who should be trusted when one's own right hand,34
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,34
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,34
My shame and guilt confounds me.,34
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,34
As e'er I did commit.,34
And once again I do receive thee honest.,34
Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased.,34
And that my love may appear plain and free,34
O me unhappy!,34
Look to the boy.,34
Look up; speak.,34
to Madam Silvia which out of my neglect was never done.,34
Here 'tis; this is it.,34
Why this is the ring I gave to Julia.,34
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.,34
I gave this unto Julia.,34
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.,34
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,34
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!,34
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me,34
In a disguise of love:,34
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.,34
O heaven! were man,34
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:,34
What is in Silvia's face but I may spy,34
Come come a hand from either:,34
Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.,34
And I mine.,34
A prize a prize a prize!,34
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,34
Sir Valentine!,34
Thurio give back or else embrace thy death;,34
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,34
Take but possession of her with a touch:,34
Sir Valentine I care not for her I;,34
His body for a girl that loves him not:,34
The more degenerate and base art thou,34
And leave her on such slight conditions.,34
I do applaud thy spirit Valentine,34
Know then I here forget all former griefs,34
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,34
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;,34
I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.,34
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.,34
These banish'd men that I have kept withal,34
Forgive them what they have committed here,34
They are reformed civil full of good,34
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:,34
Come let us go: we will include all jars,34
And as we walk along I dare be bold,34
What think you of this page my lord?,34
I warrant you my lord more grace than boy.,34
Please you I'll tell you as we pass along,34
Come Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear,34
That done our day of marriage shall be yours;,34
Exeunt,34
SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.,35
If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on,35
foot you shall see as I have said great,35
I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia,35
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be,35
Beseech you--,35
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know,35
that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience,35
us.,35
Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me,35
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.,35
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,35
more mature dignities and royal necessities made,35
though not personal have been royally attorneyed,35
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,35
embraced as it were from the ends of opposed,35
I think there is not in the world either malice or,35
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a,35
into my note.,35
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the,35
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to,35
Would they else be content to die?,35
desire to live.,35
on crutches till he had one.,35
SCENE II. A room of state in the same.,35
Nine changes of the watery star hath been,35
Without a burthen: time as long again,35
And yet we should for perpetuity,35
Yet standing in rich place I multiply,35
That go before it.,35
And pay them when you part.,35
I am question'd by my fears of what may chance,35
No sneaping winds at home to make us say,35
To tire your royalty.,35
Than you can put us to't.,35
One seven-night longer.,35
We'll part the time between's then; and in that,35
Press me not beseech you so.,35
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,35
Twere needful I denied it. My affairs,35
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay,35
Farewell our brother.,35
speak you.,35
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You sir,35
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction,35
He's beat from his best ward.,35
To tell he longs to see his son were strong:,35
But let him swear so and he shall not stay,35
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure,35
You take my lord I'll give him my commission,35
Prefix'd for's parting: yet good deed Leontes,35
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?,35
Nay but you will?,35
Verily!,35
Though you would seek to unsphere the,35
Should yet say 'Sir no going.' Verily,35
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?,35
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees,35
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily',35
Your guest then madam:,35
Which is for me less easy to commit,35
Not your gaoler then,35
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:,35
We were fair queen,35
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,35
Was not my lord,35
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,35
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not,35
That any did. Had we pursued that life,35
With stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven,35
Hereditary ours.,35
You have tripp'd since.,35
Temptations have since then been born to's; for,35
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes,35
Grace to boot!,35
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;,35
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us,35
With any but with us.,35
He'll stay my lord.,35
Hermione my dearest thou never spokest,35
Never?,35
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?,35
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless,35
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's,35
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:,35
What was my first? it has an elder sister,35
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?,35
Why that was when,35
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,35
I am yours for ever.',35
Why lo you now I have spoke to the purpose twice:,35
The other for some while a friend.,35
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.,35
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment,35
From heartiness from bounty fertile bosom,35
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,35
As in a looking-glass and then to sigh as 'twere,35
My bosom likes not nor my brows! Mamillius,35
Ay my good lord.,35
Why that's my bawcock. What hast,35
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come captain,35
And yet the steer the heifer and the calf,35
Upon his palm!--How now you wanton calf!,35
Yes if you will my lord.,35
To be full like me: yet they say we are,35
That will say anything but were they false,35
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes,35
To say this boy were like me. Come sir page,35
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--,35
Thou dost make possible things not so held,35
With what's unreal thou coactive art,35
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,35
And that to the infection of my brains,35
What means Sicilia?,35
How my lord!,35
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction,35
No in good earnest.,35
Its tenderness and make itself a pastime,35
Of my boy's face methoughts I did recoil,35
In my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled,35
As ornaments oft do too dangerous:,35
This squash this gentleman. Mine honest friend,35
No my lord I'll fight.,35
Are you so fond of your young prince as we,35
If at home sir,35
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,35
He makes a July's day short as December,35
Thoughts that would thick my blood.,35
Officed with me: we two will walk my lord,35
How thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome;,35
Next to thyself and my young rover he's,35
If you would seek us,35
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,35
Aside,35
Though you perceive me not how I give line.,35
How she holds up the neb the bill to him!,35
To her allowing husband!,35
Gone already!,35
ears a fork'd one!,35
Play too but so disgraced a part whose issue,35
Will be my knell. Go play boy play.,35
Or I am much deceived cuckolds ere now;,35
Now while I speak this holds his wife by the arm,35
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by,35
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,35
That have revolted wives the tenth of mankind,35
It is a bawdy planet that will strike,35
From east west north and south: be it concluded,35
It will let in and out the enemy,35
Have the disease and feel't not. How now boy!,35
Why that's some comfort. What Camillo there?,35
Go play Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.,35
Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer.,35
When you cast out it still came home.,35
He would not stay at your petitions: made,35
Didst perceive it?,35
They're here with me already whispering rounding,35
When I shall gust it last. How came't Camillo,35
At the good queen's entreaty.,35
But so it is it is not. Was this taken,35
For thy conceit is soaking will draw in,35
But of the finer natures? by some severals,35
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.,35
Bohemia stays here longer.,35
Stays here longer.,35
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties,35
Satisfy!,35
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee Camillo,35
My chamber-councils wherein priest-like thou,35
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been,35
In that which seems so.,35
To bide upon't thou art not honest or,35
Which hoxes honesty behind restraining,35
A servant grafted in my serious trust,35
That seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn,35
My gracious lord,35
In every one of these no man is free,35
Among the infinite doings of the world,35
If ever I were wilful-negligent,35
I play'd the fool it was my negligence,35
To do a thing where I the issue doubted,35
Against the non-performance 'twas a fear,35
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty,35
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass,35
Tis none of mine.,35
But that's past doubt you have or your eye-glass,35
For to a vision so apparent rumour,35
Resides not in that man that does not think--,35
Or else be impudently negative,35
My wife's a hobby-horse deserves a name,35
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.,35
My sovereign mistress clouded so without,35
You never spoke what did become you less,35
As deep as that though true.,35
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?,35
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible,35
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?,35
Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only,35
Why then the world and all that's in't is nothing;,35
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,35
Good my lord be cured,35
For 'tis most dangerous.,35
No no my lord.,35
I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee,35
Or else a hovering temporizer that,35
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver,35
The running of one glass.,35
Why he that wears her like a medal hanging,35
Had servants true about me that bare eyes,35
Their own particular thrifts they would do that,35
His cupbearer--whom I from meaner form,35
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,35
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;,35
Sir my lord,35
But with a lingering dram that should not work,35
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,35
I have loved thee--,35
Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled,35
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,35
Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps,35
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,35
Could man so blench?,35
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;,35
Will take again your queen as yours at first,35
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms,35
Thou dost advise me,35
I'll give no blemish to her honour none.,35
Go then; and with a countenance as clear,35
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:,35
Account me not your servant.,35
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;,35
I'll do't my lord.,35
Exit,35
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner,35
Is the obedience to a master one,35
All that are his so too. To do this deed,35
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings,35
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,35
Forsake the court: to do't or no is certain,35
Here comes Bohemia.,35
This is strange: methinks,35
Good day Camillo.,35
What is the news i' the court?,35
The king hath on him such a countenance,35
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him,35
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling,35
So leaves me to consider what is breeding,35
I dare not know my lord.,35
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;,35
And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,35
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be,35
Myself thus alter'd with 't.,35
Which puts some of us in distemper but,35
Of you that yet are well.,35
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:,35
By my regard but kill'd none so. Camillo--,35
Clerk-like experienced which no less adorns,35
In whose success we are gentle--I beseech you,35
Thereof to be inform'd imprison't not,35
I may not answer.,35
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear Camillo,35
Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least,35
What incidency thou dost guess of harm,35
Which way to be prevented if to be;,35
Sir I will tell you;,35
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,35
I mean to utter it or both yourself and me,35
On good Camillo.,35
By whom Camillo?,35
For what?,35
As he had seen't or been an instrument,35
Forbiddenly.,35
To an infected jelly and my name,35
Turn then my freshest reputation to,35
Where I arrive and my approach be shunn'd,35
That e'er was heard or read!,35
By each particular star in heaven and,35
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon,35
The fabric of his folly whose foundation,35
The standing of his body.,35
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to,35
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,35
Shall bear along impawn'd away to-night!,35
And will by twos and threes at several posterns,35
My fortunes to your service which are here,35
For by the honour of my parents I,35
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer,35
His execution sworn.,35
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:,35
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and,35
Two days ago. This jealousy,35
Must it be great and as his person's mighty,35
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever,35
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:,35
The gracious queen part of his theme but nothing,35
I will respect thee as a father if,35
It is in mine authority to command,35
To take the urgent hour. Come sir away.,35
ACT II,35
Enter HERMIONE MAMILLIUS and Ladies,35
Tis past enduring.,35
Shall I be your playfellow?,35
Why my sweet lord?,35
I were a baby still. I love you better.,35
Not for because,35
Become some women best so that there be not,35
Or a half-moon made with a pen.,35
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now,35
Blue my lord.,35
That has been blue but not her eyebrows.,35
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall,35
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,35
She is spread of late,35
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come sir now,35
And tell 's a tale.,35
As merry as you will.,35
Of sprites and goblins.,35
Come on sit down: come on and do your best,35
There was a man--,35
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;,35
Come on then,35
Enter LEONTES with ANTIGONUS Lords and others,35
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never,35
Even to their ships.,35
In my just censure in my true opinion!,35
In being so blest! There may be in the cup,35
And yet partake no venom for his knowledge,35
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known,35
With violent hefts. I have drunk,35
Camillo was his help in this his pander:,35
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain,35
He has discover'd my design and I,35
For them to play at will. How came the posterns,35
By his great authority;,35
On your command.,35
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:,35
Have too much blood in him.,35
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;,35
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes,35
But I'ld say he had not,35
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.,35
Look on her mark her well; be but about,35
The justice of your bearts will thereto add,35
Praise her but for this her without-door form,35
The shrug the hum or ha these petty brands,35
That mercy does for calumny will sear,35
When you have said 'she's goodly' come between,35
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,35
Should a villain say so,35
He were as much more villain: you my lord,35
You have mistook my lady,35
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,35
Should a like language use to all degrees,35
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said,35
More she's a traitor and Camillo is,35
What she should shame to know herself,35
A bed-swerver even as bad as those,35
To this their late escape.,35
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,35
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,35
You did mistake.,35
In those foundations which I build upon,35
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!,35
But that he speaks.,35
I must be patient till the heavens look,35
I am not prone to weeping as our sex,35
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have,35
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all my lords,35
Shall best instruct you measure me; and so,35
Shall I be heard?,35
My women may be with me; for you see,35
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress,35
As I come out: this action I now go on,35
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now,35
Go do our bidding; hence!,35
Beseech your highness call the queen again.,35
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,35
For her my lord,35
Please you to accept it that the queen is spotless,35
In this which you accuse her.,35
She's otherwise I'll keep my stables where,35
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;,35
Ay every dram of woman's flesh is false If she be.,35
Good my lord--,35
You are abused and by some putter-on,35
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,35
The second and the third nine and some five;,35
by mine honour,35
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;,35
Should not produce fair issue.,35
You smell this business with a sense as cold,35
As you feel doing thus; and see withal,35
If it be so,35
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten,35
What! lack I credit?,35
Upon this ground; and more it would content me,35
Be blamed for't how you might.,35
Commune with you of this but rather follow,35
Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness,35
Or seeming so in skill cannot or will not,35
We need no more of your advice: the matter,35
Properly ours.,35
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,35
How could that be?,35
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,35
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,35
But only seeing all other circumstances,35
Yet for a greater confirmation,35
Most piteous to be wild I have dispatch'd in post,35
Cleomenes and Dion whom you know,35
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,35
Well done my lord.,35
Than what I know yet shall the oracle,35
Whose ignorant credulity will not,35
From our free person she should be confined,35
Be left her to perform. Come follow us;,35
Will raise us all.,35
To laughter as I take it,35
Exeunt,35
Enter PAULINA a Gentleman and Attendants,35
let him have knowledge who I am.,35
Good lady,35
What dost thou then in prison?,35
Now good sir,35
For a worthy lady,35
Pray you then,35
I may not madam:,35
Here's ado,35
The access of gentle visitors!,35
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?,35
To put apart these your attendants I,35
I pray now call her.,35
Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants,35
I must be present at your conference.,35
Exit Gaoler,35
As passes colouring.,35
Dear gentlewoman,35
As well as one so great and so forlorn,35
Which never tender lady hath born greater,35
A boy?,35
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives,35
I am innocent as you.',35
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,35
He must be told on't and he shall: the office,35
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister,35
The trumpet any more. Pray you Emilia,35
If she dares trust me with her little babe,35
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know,35
The silence often of pure innocence,35
Most worthy madam,35
That your free undertaking cannot miss,35
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship,35
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;,35
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,35
Tell her Emilia.,35
As boldness from my bosom let 't not be doubted,35
Now be you blest for it!,35
come something nearer.,35
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,35
You need not fear it sir:,35
By law and process of great nature thence,35
The anger of the king nor guilty of,35
I do believe it.,35
I will stand betwixt you and danger.,35
SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.,35
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness,35
The cause were not in being--part o' the cause,35
Is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank,35
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,35
Might come to me again. Who's there?,35
How does the boy?,35
Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.,35
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,35
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,35
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,35
Exit Servant,35
The thought of my revenges that way,35
And in his parties his alliance; let him be,35
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes,35
They should not laugh if I could reach them nor,35
Enter PAULINA with a child,35
Nay rather good my lords be second to me:,35
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,35
That's enough.,35
None should come at him.,35
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,35
At each his needless heavings such as you,35
Do come with words as medicinal as true,35
That presses him from sleep.,35
No noise my lord; but needful conference,35
How!,35
I charged thee that she should not come about me:,35
I told her so my lord,35
She should not visit you.,35
From all dishonesty he can: in this,35
Commit me for committing honour trust it,35
La you now you hear:,35
But she'll not stumble.,35
And I beseech you hear me who profess,35
Your most obedient counsellor yet that dare,35
Than such as most seem yours: I say I come,35
Good queen!,35
Good queen; I say good queen;,35
A man the worst about you.,35
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes,35
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,35
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.,35
Out!,35
A most intelligencing bawd!,35
I am as ignorant in that as you,35
Than you are mad; which is enough I'll warrant,35
Traitors!,35
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired unroosted,35
Take't up I say; give't to thy crone.,35
Unvenerable be thy hands if thou,35
Which he has put upon't!,35
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt,35
A nest of traitors!,35
Nor I nor any,35
The sacred honour of himself his queen's,35
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;,35
For as the case now stands it is a curse,35
The root of his opinion which is rotten,35
A callat,35
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;,35
Hence with it and together with the dam,35
It is yours;,35
So like you 'tis the worse. Behold my lords,35
And copy of the father eye nose lip,35
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,35
The very mould and frame of hand nail finger:,35
So like to him that got it if thou hast,35
No yellow in't lest she suspect as he does,35
A gross hag,35
That wilt not stay her tongue.,35
That cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself,35
Once more take her hence.,35
Can do no more.,35
I care not:,35
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;,35
Not able to produce more accusation,35
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,35
On your allegiance,35
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,35
I pray you do not push me; I'll be gone.,35
Jove send her,35
You that are thus so tender o'er his follies,35
So so: farewell; we are gone.,35
Thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this.,35
A heart so tender o'er it take it hence,35
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:,35
And by good testimony or I'll seize thy life,35
And wilt encounter with my wrath say so;,35
Shall I dash out. Go take it to the fire;,35
I did not sir:,35
Can clear me in't.,35
He is not guilty of her coming hither.,35
Beseech your highness give us better credit:,35
So to esteem of us and on our knees we beg,35
Past and to come that you do change this purpose,35
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.,35
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel,35
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.,35
You that have been so tenderly officious,35
To save this bastard's life--for 'tis a bastard,35
--what will you adventure,35
Any thing my lord,35
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:,35
To save the innocent: any thing possible.,35
Thou wilt perform my bidding.,35
Mark and perform it see'st thou! for the fail,35
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,35
As thou art liege-man to us that thou carry,35
To some remote and desert place quite out,35
Without more mercy to its own protection,35
It came to us I do in justice charge thee,35
That thou commend it strangely to some place,35
I swear to do this though a present death,35
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens,35
Casting their savageness aside have done,35
In more than this deed does require! And blessing,35
Poor thing condemn'd to loss!,35
No I'll not rear,35
Enter a Servant,35
From those you sent to the oracle are come,35
Being well arrived from Delphos are both landed,35
So please you sir their speed,35
Twenty-three days,35
The great Apollo suddenly will have,35
Summon a session that we may arraign,35
Been publicly accused so shall she have,35
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,35
Exeunt,35
SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.,35
The climate's delicate the air most sweet,35
The common praise it bears.,35
For most it caught me the celestial habits,35
Of the grave wearers. O the sacrifice!,35
It was i' the offering!,35
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,35
That I was nothing.,35
Prove as successful to the queen--O be't so!--,35
The time is worth the use on't.,35
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,35
I little like.,35
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,35
Shall the contents discover something rare,35
And gracious be the issue!,35
SCENE II. A court of Justice.,35
This sessions to our great grief we pronounce,35
The daughter of a king our wife and one,35
Of being tyrannous since we so openly,35
Even to the guilt or the purgation.,35
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen,35
Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending,35
[Reads]            Hermione queen to the worthy,35
arraigned of high treason in committing adultery,35
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign,35
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,35
of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for,35
Since what I am to say must be but that,35
The testimony on my part no other,35
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity,35
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine,35
I doubt not then but innocence shall make,35
Tremble at patience. You my lord best know,35
Hath been as continent as chaste as true,35
Than history can pattern though devised,35
A fellow of the royal bed which owe,35
The mother to a hopeful prince here standing,35
Who please to come and hear. For life I prize it,35
Tis a derivative from me to mine,35
To your own conscience sir before Polixenes,35
How merited to be so; since he came,35
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond,35
That way inclining harden'd be the hearts,35
Cry fie upon my grave!,35
That any of these bolder vices wanted,35
Than to perform it first.,35
Through 'tis a saying sir not due to me.,35
More than mistress of,35
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,35
I loved him as in honour he required,35
A lady like me with a love even such,35
Which not to have done I think had been in me,35
To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke,35
That it was yours. Now for conspiracy,35
For me to try how: all I know of it,35
And why he left your court the gods themselves,35
You knew of his departure as you know,35
Sir,35
My life stands in the level of your dreams,35
Your actions are my dreams;,35
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame--,35
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as,35
No father owning it--which is indeed,35
Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage,35
Sir spare your threats:,35
To me can life be no commodity:,35
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,35
And first-fruits of my body from his presence,35
Starr'd most unluckily is from my breast,35
Haled out to murder: myself on every post,35
The child-bed privilege denied which 'longs,35
Here to this place i' the open air before,35
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,35
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,35
Which I would free if I shall be condemn'd,35
But what your jealousies awake I tell you,35
I do refer me to the oracle:,35
This your request,35
And in Apollos name his oracle.,35
The Emperor of Russia was my father:,35
His daughter's trial! that he did but see,35
Of pity not revenge!,35
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,35
Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought,35
Of great Apollo's priest; and that since then,35
Nor read the secrets in't.,35
Break up the seals and read.,35
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes,35
and the king shall live without an heir if that,35
Now blessed be the great Apollo!,35
Hast thou read truth?,35
As it is here set down.,35
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.,35
My lord the king the king!,35
O sir I shall be hated to report it!,35
Of the queen's speed is gone.,35
Is dead.,35
Do strike at my injustice.,35
How now there!,35
And see what death is doing.,35
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:,35
Beseech you tenderly apply to her,35
Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies with HERMIONE,35
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!,35
New woo my queen recall the good Camillo,35
For being transported by my jealousies,35
Camillo for the minister to poison,35
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied,35
Reward did threaten and encourage him,35
And fill'd with honour to my kingly guest,35
Which you knew great and to the hazard,35
No richer than his honour: how he glisters,35
Does my deeds make the blacker!,35
Woe the while!,35
Break too.,35
What studied torments tyrant hast for me?,35
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture,35
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,35
Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle,35
And then run mad indeed stark mad! for all,35
That thou betray'dst Polixenes'twas nothing;,35
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,35
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,35
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter,35
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:,35
Of the young prince whose honourable thoughts,35
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire,35
Laid to thy answer: but the last--O lords,35
The sweet'st dear'st creature's dead,35
Not dropp'd down yet.,35
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath,35
Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye,35
As I would do the gods. But O thou tyrant!,35
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee,35
Ten thousand years together naked fasting,35
In storm perpetual could not move the gods,35
Go on go on,35
All tongues to talk their bitterest.,35
Howe'er the business goes you have made fault,35
I am sorry for't:,35
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much,35
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help,35
At my petition; I beseech you rather,35
Of what you should forget. Now good my liege,35
The love I bore your queen--lo fool again!--,35
I'll not remember you of my own lord,35
And I'll say nothing.,35
When most the truth; which I receive much better,35
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:,35
The causes of their death appear unto,35
The chapel where they lie and tears shed there,35
Will bear up with this exercise so long,35
Unto these sorrows.,35
SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.,35
Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon,35
Ay my lord: and fear,35
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,35
And frown upon 's.,35
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before,35
Make your best haste and go not,35
Besides this place is famous for the creatures,35
Go thou away:,35
I am glad at heart,35
Exit,35
I have heard but not believed,35
May walk again: if such thing be thy mother,35
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,35
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,35
Like very sanctity she did approach,35
And gasping to begin some speech her eyes,35
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,35
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out,35
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,35
Is counted lost for ever Perdita,35
Put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see,35
She melted into air. Affrighted much,35
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:,35
I will be squared by this. I do believe,35
Apollo would this being indeed the issue,35
Either for life or death upon the earth,35
There lie and there thy character: there these;,35
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,35
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,35
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!,35
A lullaby too rough: I never saw,35
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:,35
Exit pursued by a bear,35
I would there were no age between sixteen and,35
rest; for there is nothing in the between but,35
stealing fighting--Hark you now! Would any but,35
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my,35
than the master: if any where I have them 'tis by,35
will what have we here! Mercy on 's a barne a very,35
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure some 'scape:,35
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been,35
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this,35
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed,35
Enter Clown,35
What art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk,35
ailest thou man?,35
but I am not to say it is a sea for it is now the,35
a bodkin's point.,35
I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages,35
point. O the most piteous cry of the poor souls!,35
ship boring the moon with her main-mast and anon,35
cork into a hogshead. And then for the,35
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said,35
end of the ship to see how the sea flap-dragoned,35
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared,35
the sea or weather.,35
Now now: I have not winked since I saw these,35
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it,35
Would I had been by to have helped the old man!,35
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.,35
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things,35
thee; look thee a bearing-cloth for a squire's,35
open't. So let's see: it was told me I should be,35
open't. What's within boy?,35
are forgiven you you're well to live. Gold! all gold!,35
with't keep it close: home home the next way.,35
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come good,35
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see,35
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they,35
it.,35
which is left of him what he is fetch me to the,35
Marry will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.,35
Exeunt,35
SCENE I:,35
I that please some try all both joy and terror,35
Now take upon me in the name of Time,35
To me or my swift passage that I slide,35
Of that wide gap since it is in my power,35
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass,35
Or what is now received: I witness to,35
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale,35
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,35
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,35
That he shuts up himself imagine me,35
In fair Bohemia and remember well,35
I now name to you; and with speed so pace,35
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues,35
Be known when 'tis brought forth.,35
And what to her adheres which follows after,35
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;,35
He wishes earnestly you never may.,35
SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.,35
I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate:,35
grant this.,35
I have for the most part been aired abroad I,35
king my master hath sent for me; to whose feeling,35
think so which is another spur to my departure.,35
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of,35
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou having,35
sufficiently manage must either stay to execute,35
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough,35
thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit,35
country Sicilia prithee speak no more; whose very,35
penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king,35
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.,35
son? Kings are no less unhappy their issue not,35
they have approved their virtues.,35
his happier affairs may be are to me unknown: but I,35
from court and is less frequent to his princely,35
I have considered so much Camillo and with some,35
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this,35
most homely shepherd; a man they say that from,35
neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate.,35
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is,35
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but I,35
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will not,35
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not,35
Prithee be my present partner in this business and,35
I willingly obey your command.,35
Exeunt,35
Enter AUTOLYCUS singing,35
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,35
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.,35
With heigh! the sweet birds O how they sing!,35
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.,35
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,35
While we lie tumbling in the hay.,35
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:,35
The pale moon shines by night:,35
I then do most go right.,35
And bear the sow-skin budget,35
And in the stocks avouch it.,35
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who,35
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and,35
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful,35
me: for the life to come I sleep out the thought,35
Enter Clown,35
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred,35
[Aside],35
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am,35
of sugar five pound of currants rice--what will,35
hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it,35
the shearers three-man-song-men all and very good,35
one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to,35
pies; mace; dates?--none that's out of my note;,35
may beg; four pound of prunes and as many of,35
O that ever I was born!,35
I' the name of me--,35
then death death!,35
on thee rather than have these off.,35
than the stripes I have received which are mighty,35
Alas poor man! a million of beating may come to a,35
I am robbed sir and beaten; my money and apparel,35
me.,35
A footman sweet sir a footman.,35
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,35
I'll help thee: come lend me thy hand.,35
Alas poor soul!,35
shoulder-blade is out.,35
[Picking his pocket],35
a charitable office.,35
No good sweet sir; no I beseech you sir: I have,35
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money or,35
that kills my heart.,35
A fellow sir that I have known to go about with,35
prince: I cannot tell good sir for which of his,35
His vices you would say; there's no virtue whipped,35
there; and yet it will no more but abide.,35
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a,35
motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinker's,35
and having flown over many knavish professions he,35
Out upon him! prig for my life prig: he haunts,35
Very true sir; he sir he; that's the rogue that,35
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had,35
I must confess to you sir I am no fighter: I am,35
him.,35
Sweet sir much better than I was; I can stand and,35
softly towards my kinsman's.,35
No good-faced sir; no sweet sir.,35
sheep-shearing.,35
Exit Clown,35
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I,35
shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name,35
Sings,35
And merrily hent the stile-a:,35
Your sad tires in a mile-a.,35
SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.,35
These your unusual weeds to each part of you,35
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing,35
And you the queen on't.,35
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:,35
The gracious mark o' the land you have obscured,35
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts,35
Digest it with a custom I should blush,35
To show myself a glass.,35
When my good falcon made her flight across,35
Now Jove afford you cause!,35
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble,35
Should pass this way as you did: O the Fates!,35
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how,35
The sternness of his presence?,35
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,35
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter,35
A ram and bleated; and the fire-robed god,35
As I seem now. Their transformations,35
Nor in a way so chaste since my desires,35
Burn hotter than my faith.,35
Your resolution cannot hold when 'tis,35
One of these two must be necessities,35
change this purpose,35
Thou dearest Perdita,35
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine my fair,35
Mine own nor any thing to any if,35
Though destiny say no. Be merry gentle;,35
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:,35
Of celebration of that nuptial which,35
O lady Fortune,35
See your guests approach:,35
And let's be red with mirth.,35
Fie daughter! when my old wife lived upon,35
Both dame and servant; welcomed all served all;,35
At upper end o' the table now i' the middle;,35
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,35
As if you were a feasted one and not,35
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is,35
Come quench your blushes and present yourself,35
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,35
[To POLIXENES]                  Sir welcome:,35
The hostess-ship o' the day.,35
You're welcome sir.,35
For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep,35
Grace and remembrance be to you both,35
Shepherdess,35
With flowers of winter.,35
Not yet on summer's death nor on the birth,35
flowers o' the season,35
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind,35
To get slips of them.,35
Do you neglect them?,35
There is an art which in their piedness shares,35
Say there be;,35
But nature makes that mean: so over that art,35
That nature makes. You see sweet maid we marry,35
And make conceive a bark of baser kind,35
Which does mend nature change it rather but,35
So it is.,35
And do not call them bastards.,35
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;,35
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore,35
Hot lavender mints savoury marjoram;,35
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers,35
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.,35
And only live by gazing.,35
You'd be so lean that blasts of January,35
Now my fair'st friend,35
Become your time of day; and yours and yours,35
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,35
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,35
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,35
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,35
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady,35
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,35
To make you garlands of and my sweet friend,35
What like a corse?,35
Not like a corse; or if not to be buried,35
Methinks I play as I have seen them do,35
Does change my disposition.,35
Still betters what is done. When you speak sweet.,35
I'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms,35
To sing them too: when you do dance I wish you,35
Nothing but that; move still still so,35
So singular in each particular,35
That all your acts are queens.,35
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,35
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,35
You woo'd me the false way.,35
As little skill to fear as I have purpose,35
Your hand my Perdita: so turtles pair,35
I'll swear for 'em.,35
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems,35
Too noble for this place.,35
That makes her blood look out: good sooth she is,35
Come on strike up!,35
To mend her kissing with!,35
Not a word a word; we stand upon our manners.,35
Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses,35
Which dances with your daughter?,35
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it,35
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:,35
Upon the water as he'll stand and read,35
I think there is not half a kiss to choose,35
She dances featly.,35
That should be silent: if young Doricles,35
Which he not dreams of.,35
O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the,35
pipe; no the bagpipe could not move you: he sings,35
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's,35
He could never come better; he shall come in. I,35
matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing,35
He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes; no,35
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without,35
burthens of dildos and fadings 'jump her and thump,35
as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into,35
no harm good man;' puts him off slights him with,35
This is a brave fellow.,35
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?,35
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can,35
gross: inkles caddisses cambrics lawns: why he,35
would think a smock were a she-angel he so chants,35
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.,35
Exit Servant,35
than you'ld think sister.,35
Enter AUTOLYCUS singing,35
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;,35
Masks for faces and for noses;,35
Perfume for a lady's chamber;,35
For my lads to give their dears:,35
What maids lack from head to heel:,35
Buy lads or else your lasses cry: Come buy.,35
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am it,35
I was promised them against the feast; but they come,35
He hath promised you more than that or there be liars.,35
paid you more which will shame you to give him again.,35
wear their plackets where they should bear their,35
going to bed or kiln-hole to whistle off these,35
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour,35
I have done. Come you promised me a tawdry-lace,35
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way,35
And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad;,35
Fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here.,35
What hast here? ballads?,35
life for then we are sure they are true.,35
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a,35
toads carbonadoed.,35
Very true and but a month old.,35
Here's the midwife's name to't one Mistress,35
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?,35
Come on lay it by: and let's first see moe,35
Here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon,35
forty thousand fathom above water and sung this,35
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold,35
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.,35
Five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than,35
Lay it by too: another.,35
Let's have some merry ones.,35
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's,35
request I can tell you.,35
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.,35
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my,35
SONG,35
Where it fits not you to know.,35
O whither?,35
It becomes thy oath full well,35
Me too let me go thither.,35
If to either thou dost ill.,35
What neither?,35
Thou hast sworn my love to be.,35
Then whither goest? say whither?,35
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we'll,35
me. Wenches I'll buy for you both. Pedlar let's,35
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA,35
Follows singing,35
Or lace for your cape,35
Any silk any thread,35
Of the new'st and finest finest wear-a?,35
Money's a medler.,35
Exit,35
Master there is three carters three shepherds,35
themselves all men of hair they call themselves,35
say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are,35
be not too rough for some that know little but,35
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much,35
You weary those that refresh us: pray let's see,35
One three of them by their own report sir hath,35
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.,35
pleased let them come in; but quickly now.,35
Exit,35
O father you'll know more of that hereafter.,35
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.,35
To FLORIZEL,35
Your heart is full of something that does take,35
And handed love as you do I was wont,35
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it,35
And nothing marted with him. If your lass,35
Your lack of love or bounty you were straited,35
Of happy holding her.,35
She prizes not such trifles as these are:,35
Up in my heart; which I have given already,35
Before this ancient sir who it should seem,35
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,35
snow that's bolted,35
What follows this?,35
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:,35
What you profess.,35
And this my neighbour too?,35
Than he and men the earth the heavens and all:,35
Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth,35
More than was ever man's I would not prize them,35
Commend them and condemn them to her service,35
Fairly offer'd.,35
But my daughter,35
I cannot speak,35
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out,35
Take hands a bargain!,35
I give my daughter to him and will make,35
O that must be,35
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;,35
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.,35
And daughter yours.,35
Have you a father?,35
Knows he of this?,35
Methinks a father,35
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,35
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid,35
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?,35
But what he did being childish?,35
He has his health and ampler strength indeed,35
By my white beard,35
Something unfilial: reason my son,35
The father all whose joy is nothing else,35
In such a business.,35
But for some other reasons my grave sir,35
My father of this business.,35
He shall not.,35
No he must not.,35
At knowing of thy choice.,35
Mark our contract.,35
Discovering himself,35
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,35
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can,35
Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know,35
O my heart!,35
More homely than thy state. For thee fond boy,35
That thou no more shalt see this knack as never,35
Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin,35
Follow us to the court. Thou churl for this time,35
From the dead blow of it. And you enchantment.--,35
That makes himself but for our honour therein,35
These rural latches to his entrance open,35
I will devise a death as cruel for thee,35
Exit,35
I was not much afeard; for once or twice,35
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court,35
Looks on alike. Will't please you sir be gone?,35
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine--,35
But milk my ewes and weep.,35
Speak ere thou diest.,35
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!,35
That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea,35
To lie close by his honest bones: but now,35
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,35
and wouldst adventure,35
If I might die within this hour I have lived,35
Exit,35
I am but sorry not afeard; delay'd,35
More straining on for plucking back not following,35
Gracious my lord,35
He will allow no speech which I do guess,35
Will he endure your sight as yet I fear:,35
Come not before him.,35
I think Camillo?,35
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!,35
But till 'twere known!,35
The violation of my faith; and then,35
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:,35
Am heir to my affection.,35
I am and by my fancy: if my reason,35
If not my senses better pleased with madness,35
This is desperate sir.,35
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,35
Be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or,35
In unknown fathoms will I break my oath,35
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,35
To see him any more--cast your good counsels,35
Tug for the time to come. This you may know,35
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;,35
A vessel rides fast by but not prepared,35
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor,35
O my lord!,35
Or stronger for your need.,35
Drawing her aside,35
He's irremoveable,35
His going I could frame to serve my turn,35
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia,35
I so much thirst to see.,35
I am so fraught with curious business that,35
Sir I think,35
That I have borne your father?,35
Have you deserved: it is my father's music,35
To have them recompensed as thought on.,35
If you may please to think I love the king,35
Your gracious self embrace but my direction:,35
May suffer alteration on mine honour,35
As shall become your highness; where you may,35
There's no disjunction to be made but by--,35
And with my best endeavours in your absence,35
And bring him up to liking.,35
May this almost a miracle be done?,35
And after that trust to thee.,35
A place whereto you'll go?,35
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty,35
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies,35
Then list to me:,35
But undergo this flight make for Sicilia,35
For so I see she must be 'fore Leontes:,35
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see,35
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,35
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him,35
He chides to hell and bids the other grow,35
Worthy Camillo,35
Hold up before him?,35
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,35
What you as from your father shall deliver,35
The which shall point you forth at every sitting,35
But that you have your father's bosom there,35
I am bound to you:,35
A cause more promising,35
To unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain,35
But as you shake off one to take another;,35
Do their best office if they can but stay you,35
Prosperity's the very bond of love,35
Affliction alters.,35
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,35
Yea say you so?,35
seven years,35
My good Camillo,35
She is i' the rear our birth.,35
She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress,35
Your pardon sir; for this,35
My prettiest Perdita!,35
Preserver of my father now of me,35
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,35
My lord,35
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care,35
The scene you play were mine. For instance sir,35
They talk aside,35
Ha ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust his,35
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone not a,35
knife tape glove shoe-tie bracelet horn-ring,35
should buy first as if my trinkets had been,35
by which means I saw whose purse was best in,35
remembered. My clown who wants but something to,35
wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes,35
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses,35
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a,35
chains: no hearing no feeling but my sir's song,35
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their,35
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's,35
left a purse alive in the whole army.,35
Nay but my letters by this means being there,35
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--,35
Happy be you!,35
Who have we here?,35
We'll make an instrument of this omit,35
If they have overheard me now why hanging.,35
not man; here's no harm intended to thee.,35
Why be so still; here's nobody will steal that from,35
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,35
change garments with this gentleman: though the,35
there's some boot.,35
Aside,35
Nay prithee dispatch: the gentleman is half,35
Are you in earnest sir?,35
I smell the trick on't.,35
Indeed I have had earnest: but I cannot with,35
Unbuckle unbuckle.,35
Fortunate mistress--let my prophecy,35
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat,35
Dismantle you and as you can disliken,35
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard,35
I see the play so lies,35
No remedy.,35
Should I now meet my father,35
Nay you shall have no hat.,35
Come lady come. Farewell my friend.,35
O Perdita what have we twain forgot!,35
[Aside]  What I do next shall be to tell the king,35
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail,35
I shall review Sicilia for whose sight,35
Fortune speed us!,35
The swifter speed the better.,35
I understand the business I hear it: to have an,35
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite,35
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.,35
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do,35
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of,35
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of,35
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;,35
Re-enter Clown and Shepherd,35
every lane's end every shop church session,35
See see; what a man you are now!,35
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.,35
Nay but hear me.,35
She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh,35
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show,35
things all but what she has with her: this being,35
I will tell the king all every word yea and his,35
neither to his father nor to me to go about to make,35
Indeed brother-in-law was the farthest off you,35
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.,35
Well let us to the king: there is that in this,35
[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint,35
Pray heartily he be at palace.,35
sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.,35
How now rustics! whither are you bound?,35
Your affairs there what with whom the condition,35
names your ages of what having breeding and any,35
We are but plain fellows sir.,35
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen and they,35
it with stamped coin not stabbing steel; therefore,35
Your worship had like to have given us one if you,35
Are you a courtier an't like you sir?,35
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?,35
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I,35
for that I insinuate or toaze from thee thy,35
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck,35
open thy affair.,35
What advocate hast thou to him?,35
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you,35
None sir; I have no pheasant cock nor hen.,35
Yet nature might have made me as these are,35
This cannot be but a great courtier.,35
them not handsomely.,35
a great man I'll warrant; I know by the picking,35
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?,35
Sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,35
shall know within this hour if I may come to the,35
Age thou hast lost thy labour.,35
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a,35
if thou beest capable of things serious thou must,35
So 'tis said sir; about his son that should have,35
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast let him fly:,35
feel will break the back of man the heart of monster.,35
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy,35
him though removed fifty times shall all come,35
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a,35
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death,35
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy.,35
like you sir?,35
nointed over with honey set on the head of a,35
and a dram dead; then recovered again with,35
he is and in the hottest day prognostication,35
sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he,35
talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries,35
capital? Tell me for you seem to be honest plain,35
gently considered I'll bring you where he is,35
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man,35
shall do it.,35
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn,35
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,35
An't please you sir to undertake the business for,35
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.,35
Ay sir.,35
In some sort sir: but though my case be a pitiful,35
O that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,35
Comfort good comfort! We must to the king and show,35
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir I,35
business is performed and remain as he says your,35
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;,35
hedge and follow you.,35
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.,35
If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would,35
courted now with a double occasion gold and a means,35
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring,35
think it fit to shore them again and that the,35
nothing let him call me rogue for being so far,35
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present,35
Exit,35
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.,35
Sir you have done enough and have perform'd,35
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed paid down,35
Do as the heavens have done forget your evil;,35
Whilst I remember,35
My blemishes in them and so still think of,35
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and,35
Bred his hopes out of.,35
If one by one you wedded all the world,35
To make a perfect woman she you kill'd,35
I think so. Kill'd!,35
Sorely to say I did; it is as bitter,35
Say so but seldom.,35
You might have spoken a thousand things that would,35
Your kindness better.,35
Would have him wed again.,35
You pity not the state nor the remembrance,35
What dangers by his highness' fail of issue,35
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy,35
What holier than for royalty's repair,35
To bless the bed of majesty again,35
There is none worthy,35
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;,35
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,35
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,35
As my Antigonus to break his grave,35
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel,35
Oppose against their wills.,35
Care not for issue;,35
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor,35
Good Paulina,35
I know in honour O that ever I,35
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,35
And left them,35
Thou speak'st truth.,35
And better used would make her sainted spirit,35
Where we're offenders now appear soul-vex'd,35
Had she such power,35
She had; and would incense me,35
I should so.,35
Her eye and tell me for what dull part in't,35
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd,35
Stars stars,35
I'll have no wife Paulina.,35
Never to marry but by my free leave?,35
Then good my lords bear witness to his oath.,35
Unless another,35
Affront his eye.,35
I have done.,35
No remedy but you will--give me the office,35
As was your former; but she shall be such,35
it should take joy,35
My true Paulina,35
That,35
Never till then.,35
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,35
The fairest I have yet beheld desires access,35
What with him? he comes not,35
So out of circumstance and sudden tells us,35
By need and accident. What train?,35
And those but mean.,35
Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think,35
O Hermione,35
Above a better gone so must thy grave,35
Have said and writ so but your writing now,35
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse,35
To say you have seen a better.,35
The one I have almost forgot--your pardon--,35
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,35
Of all professors else make proselytes,35
How! not women?,35
More worth than any man; men that she is,35
Go Cleomenes;,35
Bring them to our embracement. Still 'tis strange,35
He thus should steal upon us.,35
Jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd,35
Between their births.,35
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,35
Will bring me to consider that which may,35
Re-enter CLEOMENES and others with FLORIZEL and PERDITA,35
For she did print your royal father off,35
Your father's image is so hit in you,35
As I did him and speak of something wildly,35
And your fair princess--goddess!--O alas!,35
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as,35
All mine own folly--the society,35
Though bearing misery I desire my life,35
By his command,35
Give you all greetings that a king at friend,35
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized,35
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his,35
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres,35
O my brother,35
Afresh within me and these thy offices,35
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,35
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,35
To greet a man not worth her pains much less,35
Good my lord,35
Where the warlike Smalus,35
Most royal sir from thence; from him whose daughter,35
A prosperous south-wind friendly we have cross'd,35
For visiting your highness: my best train,35
Who for Bohemia bend to signify,35
But my arrival and my wife's in safety,35
The blessed gods,35
Do climate here! You have a holy father,35
So sacred as it is I have done sin:,35
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,35
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,35
Such goodly things as you!,35
Most noble sir,35
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you great sir,35
Desires you to attach his son who has--,35
Fled from his father from his hopes and with,35
Where's Bohemia? speak.,35
I speak amazedly; and it becomes,35
Whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems,35
The father of this seeming lady and,35
With this young prince.,35
Whose honour and whose honesty till now,35
Lay't so to his charge:,35
Who? Camillo?,35
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I,35
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:,35
With divers deaths in death.,35
The heaven sets spies upon us will not have,35
You are married?,35
The stars I see will kiss the valleys first:,35
My lord,35
She is,35
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed,35
Most sorry you have broken from his liking,35
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,35
Dear look up:,35

Remember since you owed no more to time,35
Step forth mine advocate; at your request,35
Would he do so I'ld beg your precious mistress,35
Sir my liege,35
Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes,35
I thought of her,35
To FLORIZEL,35
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:,35
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand,35
And mark what way I make: come good my lord.,35
SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.,35
Beseech you sir were you present at this relation?,35
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:,35
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I,35
I would most gladly know the issue of it.,35
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were,35
staring on one another to tear the cases of their,35
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard,35
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest,35
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the,35
Enter another Gentleman,35
The news Rogero?,35
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is,35
cannot be able to express it.,35
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can,35
which is called true is so like an old tale that,35
found his heir?,35
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you,35
of Queen Hermione's her jewel about the neck of it,35
know to be his character the majesty of the,35
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,35
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see,35
No.,35
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one,35
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their,35
holding up of hands with countenances of such,35
not by favour. Our king being ready to leap out of,35
joy were now become a loss cries 'O thy mother,35
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his,35
shepherd which stands by like a weather-bitten,35
another encounter which lames report to follow it,35
What pray you became of Antigonus that carried,35
Like an old tale still which will have matter to,35
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this,35
innocence which seems much to justify him but a,35
What became of his bark and his followers?,35
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the,35
even then lost when it was found. But O the noble,35
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of,35
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,35
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger,35
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of,35
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which,35
the fish was when at the relation of the queen's,35
confessed and lamented by the king how,35
sign of dolour to another she did with an 'Alas',35
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed,35
could have seen 't the woe had been universal.,35
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,35
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare,35
eternity and could put breath into his work would,35
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that,35
answer: thither with all greediness of affection,35
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;,35
since the death of Hermione visited that removed,35
the rejoicing?,35
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:,35
Let's along.,35
Now had I not the dash of my former life in me,35
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard,35
at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter,35
sea-sick and himself little better extremity of,35
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I,35
have relished among my other discredits.,35
Here come those I have done good to against my will,35
Come boy; I am past moe children but thy sons and,35
You are well met sir. You denied to fight with me,35
See you these clothes? say you see them not and,35
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the,35
I know you are now sir a gentleman born.,35
And so have I boy.,35
father; for the king's son took me by the hand and,35
father brother; and then the prince my brother and,35
so we wept and there was the first gentleman-like,35
We may live son to shed many more.,35
preposterous estate as we are.,35
faults I have committed to your worship and to give,35
Prithee son do; for we must be gentle now we are,35
Thou wilt amend thy life?,35
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou,35
You may say it but not swear it.,35
franklins say it I'll swear it.,35
If it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear,35
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and,35
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be,35
be a tall fellow of thy hands.,35
Ay by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not,35
being a tall fellow trust me not. Hark! the kings,35

Exeunt,35

It is a surplus of your grace which never,35
O Paulina,35
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery,35
In many singularities; but we saw not,35
The statue of her mother.,35
So her dead likeness I do well believe,35
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it,35
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever,35
PAULINA draws a curtain and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue,35
Your wonder: but yet speak; first you my liege,35
Her natural posture!,35
Thou art Hermione; or rather thou art she,35
As infancy and grace. But yet Paulina,35
So aged as this seems.,35
So much the more our carver's excellence;,35
As she lived now.,35
So much to my good comfort as it is,35
Even with such life of majesty warm life,35
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me,35
There's magic in thy majesty which has,35
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,35
And give me leave,35
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,35
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.,35
The statue is but newly fix'd the colour's Not dry.,35
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,35
Did ever so long live; no sorrow,35
Dear my brother,35
To take off so much grief from you as he,35
Indeed my lord,35
Would thus have wrought you--for the stone is mine--,35
Do not draw the curtain.,35
May think anon it moves.,35
Would I were dead but that methinks already--,35
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins,35
Masterly done:,35
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,35
I'll draw the curtain:,35
He'll think anon it lives.,35
Make me to think so twenty years together!,35
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.,35
I could afflict you farther.,35
For this affliction has a taste as sweet,35
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel,35
For I will kiss her.,35
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;,35
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?,35
So long could I,35
Either forbear,35
For more amazement. If you can behold it,35
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--,35
By wicked powers.,35
I am content to look on: what to speak,35
To make her speak as move.,35
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;,35
I am about let them depart.,35
No foot shall stir.,35
Music,35
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,35
Bequeath to death your numbness for from him,35
HERMIONE comes down,35
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her,35
You kill her double. Nay present your hand:,35
Is she become the suitor?,35
If this be magic let it be an art,35
She embraces him.,35
If she pertain to life let her speak too.,35
Or how stolen from the dead.,35
Were it but told you should be hooted at,35
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.,35
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn good lady;,35
You gods look down,35
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me mine own.,35

Gave hope thou wast in being have preserved,35

Your joys with like relation. Go together,35
Partake to every one. I an old turtle,35
My mate that's never to be found again,35
O peace Paulina!,35
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,35
But how is to be question'd; for I saw her,35
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--,35
An honourable husband. Come Camillo,35
Is richly noted and here justified,35
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,35
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,35
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,35
Each one demand an answer to his part,35
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.,35
