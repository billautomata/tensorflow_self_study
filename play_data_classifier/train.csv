SCENE I. London. The palace.,0
So shaken as we are so wan with care,0
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils,0
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil,0
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,0
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,0
All of one nature of one substance bred,0
And furious close of civil butchery,0
March all one way and be no more opposed,0
The edge of war like an ill-sheathed knife,0
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,0
We are impressed and engaged to fight,0
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb,0
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet,0
For our advantage on the bitter cross.,0
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:,0
Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland,0
In forwarding this dear expedience.,0
And many limits of the charge set down,0
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;,0
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight,0
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,0
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,0
By those Welshwomen done as may not be,0
It seems then that the tidings of this broil,0
This match'd with other did my gracious lord;,0
Came from the north and thus it did import:,0
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,0
At Holmedon met,0
As by discharge of their artillery,0
For he that brought them in the very heat,0
Uncertain of the issue any way.,0
Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse.,0
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;,0
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:,0
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see,0
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son,0
Of Murray Angus and Menteith:,0
A gallant prize? ha cousin is it not?,0
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.,0
In envy that my Lord Northumberland,0
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;,0
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:,0
See riot and dishonour stain the brow,0
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged,0
And call'd mine Percy his Plantagenet!,0
But let him from my thoughts. What think you coz,0
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,0
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.,0
Malevolent to you in all aspects;,0
The crest of youth against your dignity.,0
And for this cause awhile we must neglect,0
Cousin on Wednesday next our council we,0
But come yourself with speed to us again;,0
Than out of anger can be uttered.,0
Exeunt,0
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF,0
Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack,0
benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to,0
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the,0
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the,0
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta I see no,0
the time of the day.,0
purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not,0
I prithee sweet wag when thou art king as God,0
thou wilt have none--,0
No by my troth not so much as will serve to,0
Well how then? come roundly roundly.,0
us that are squires of the night's body be called,0
foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the,0
being governed as the sea is by our noble and,0
Thou sayest well and it holds well too; for the,0
flow like the sea being governed as the sea is,0
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most,0
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;',0
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.,0
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?,0
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?,0
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a,0
Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?,0
time and oft.,0
No; I'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there.,0
and where it would not I have used my credit.,0
that thou art heir apparent--But I prithee sweet,0
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is,0
not thou when thou art king hang a thief.,0
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord I'll be a brave judge.,0
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.,0
humour as well as waiting in the court I can tell,0
For obtaining of suits?,0
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood I am as melancholy,0
Or an old lion or a lover's lute.,0
What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of,0
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed,0
prince. But Hal I prithee trouble me no more,0
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old,0
street about you sir but I marked him not; and yet,0
yet he talked wisely and in the street too.,0
streets and no man regards it.,0
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon,0
thee Hal I knew nothing; and now am I if a man,0
wicked. I must give over this life and I will give,0
I'll be damned for never a king's son in,0
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack?,0
do not call me villain and baffle me.,0
to purse-taking.,0
man to labour in his vocation.,0
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a,0
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the,0
a true man.,0
Good morrow sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?,0
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou,0
and a cold capon's leg?,0
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of,0
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.,0
But my lads my lads to-morrow morning by four,0
to Canterbury with rich offerings and traders,0
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:,0
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it,0
your purses full of crowns; if you will not tarry,0
Hear ye Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,0
You will chops?,0
Who I rob? I a thief? not I by my faith.,0
fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood,0
Well then once in my days I'll be a madcap.,0
Well come what will I'll tarry at home.,0
I care not.,0
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure,0
Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him,0
move and what he hears may be believed that the,0
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want,0
Farewell thou latter spring! farewell All-hallown summer!,0
Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us,0
manage alone. Falstaff Bardolph Peto and Gadshill,0
yourself and I will not be there; and when they,0
this head off from my shoulders.,0
Why we will set forth before or after them and,0
our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure,0
no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them.,0
horses by our habits and by every other,0
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them,0
leave them: and sirrah I have cases of buckram,0
Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us.,0
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the,0
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the,0
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at,0
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this,0
Well I'll go with thee: provide us all things,0
there I'll sup. Farewell.,0
Exit Poins,0
The unyoked humour of your idleness:,0
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds,0
That when he please again to be himself,0
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists,0
If all the year were playing holidays,0
But when they seldom come they wish'd for come,0
So when this loose behavior I throw off,0
By how much better than my word I am,0
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,0
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes,0
I'll so offend to make offence a skill;,0
Exit,0
Enter the KING NORTHUMBERLAND WORCESTER HOTSPUR SIR WALTER BLUNT with others,0
Unapt to stir at these indignities,0
You tread upon my patience: but be sure,0
Mighty and to be fear'd than my condition;,0
And therefore lost that title of respect,0
Our house my sovereign liege little deserves,0
And that same greatness too which our own hands,0
My lord.--,0
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:,0
And majesty might never yet endure,0
You have good leave to leave us: when we need,0
Exit Worcester,0
To North,0
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,0
Were as he says not with such strength denied,0
Either envy therefore or misprison,0
My liege I did deny no prisoners.,0
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,0
Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd,0
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;,0
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held,0
He gave his nose and took't away again;,0
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,0
He call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly,0
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.,0
He question'd me; amongst the rest demanded,0
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold,0
Out of my grief and my impatience,0
He should or he should not; for he made me mad,0
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman,0
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth,0
And that it was great pity so it was,0
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,0
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,0
This bald unjointed chat of his my lord,0
And I beseech you let not his report,0
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.,0
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said,0
At such a time with all the rest retold,0
To do him wrong or any way impeach,0
Why yet he doth deny his prisoners,0
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight,0
Who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd,0
Against that great magician damn'd Glendower,0
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then,0
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,0
No on the barren mountains let him starve;,0
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost,0
Revolted Mortimer!,0
But by the chance of war; to prove that true,0
Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took,0
In single opposition hand to hand,0
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:,0
they drink,0
Who then affrighted with their bloody looks,0
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,0
Never did base and rotten policy,0
Nor could the noble Mortimer,0
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.,0
He never did encounter with Glendower:,0
He durst as well have met the devil alone,0
Art thou not ashamed? But sirrah henceforth,0
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,0
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,0
Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it.,0
An if the devil come and roar for them,0
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,0
What drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:,0
Re-enter WORCESTER,0
Zounds I will speak of him; and let my soul,0
Yea on his part I'll empty all these veins,0
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer,0
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.,0
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?,0
And when I urged the ransom once again,0
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,0
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd,0
He was; I heard the proclamation:,0
--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth,0
From whence he intercepted did return,0
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth,0
But soft I pray you; did King Richard then,0
Heir to the crown?,0
Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king,0
But shall it be that you that set the crown,0
And for his sake wear the detested blot,0
That you a world of curses undergo,0
The cords the ladder or the hangman rather?,0
To show the line and the predicament,0
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,0
That men of your nobility and power,0
As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,0
An plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke?,0
That you are fool'd discarded and shook off,0
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem,0
Into the good thoughts of the world again,0
Of this proud king who studies day and night,0
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:,0
Peace cousin say no more:,0
And to your quick-conceiving discontents,0
As full of peril and adventurous spirit,0
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.,0
Send danger from the east unto the west,0
And let them grapple: O the blood more stirs,0
Imagination of some great exploit,0
By heaven methinks it were an easy leap,0
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,0
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;,0
Without corrival all her dignities:,0
He apprehends a world of figures here,0
Good cousin give me audience for a while.,0
Those same noble Scots,0
I'll keep them all;,0
No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not:,0
You start away,0
Those prisoners you shall keep.,0
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;,0
But I will find him when he lies asleep,0
Nay,0
Nothing but 'Mortimer' and give it him,0
Hear you cousin; a word.,0
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:,0
But that I think his father loves him not,0
I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.,0
When you are better temper'd to attend.,0
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,0
Why look you I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,0
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke.,0
A plague upon it it is in Gloucestershire;,0
His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee,0
Sblood!--,0
At Berkley castle.,0
Why what a candy deal of courtesy,0
Look'when his infant fortune came to age',0
O the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!,0
Nay if you have not to it again;,0
I have done i' faith.,0
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,0
For powers in Scotland; which for divers reasons,0
Will easily be granted. You my lord,0
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,0
Of that same noble prelate well beloved,0
Of York is it not?,0
His brother's death at Bristol the Lord Scroop.,0
As what I think might be but what I know,0
And only stays but to behold the face,0
I smell it: upon my life it will do well.,0
Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot;,0
To join with Mortimer ha?,0
In faith it is exceedingly well aim'd.,0
To save our heads by raising of a head;,0
The king will always think him in our debt,0
Till he hath found a time to pay us home:,0
To make us strangers to his looks of love.,0
Cousin farewell: no further go in this,0
When time is ripe which will be suddenly,0
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,0
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,0
Farewell good brother: we shall thrive I trust.,0
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!,0
ACT II,0
Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand,0
hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney and,0
[Within]   Anon anon.,0
in the point; poor jade is wrung in the withers out,0
Enter another Carrier,0
is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this,0
Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats,0
I think this be the most villanous house in all,0
Like a tench! by the mass there is ne'er a king,0
the first cock.,0
leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds,0
What ostler! come away and be hanged!,0
to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.,0
starved. What ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou,0
twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate,0
hast thou no faith in thee?,0
Good morrow carriers. What's o'clock?,0
I pray thee lend me thy lantern to see my gelding,0
Nay by God soft; I know a trick worth two of that i' faith.,0
Ay when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern quoth,0
Sirrah carrier what time do you mean to come to London?,0
thee. Come neighbour Mugs we'll call up the,0

What ho! chamberlain!,0
That's even as fair as--at hand quoth the,0
of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;,0
Enter Chamberlain,0
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the,0
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his,0
that hath abundance of charge too God knows what.,0
they will away presently.,0
clerks I'll give thee this neck.,0
hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas,0
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,0
Sir John hangs with me and thou knowest he is no,0
dreamest not of the which for sport sake are,0
if matters should be looked into for their own,0
foot-land rakers no long-staff sixpenny strikers,0
but with nobility and tranquillity burgomasters and,0
strike sooner than speak and speak sooner than,0
I lie; for they pray continually to their saint the,0
on her for they ride up and down on her and make,0
What the commonwealth their boots? will she hold,0
She will she will; justice hath liquored her. We,0
of fern-seed we walk invisible.,0
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.,0
purchase as I am a true man.,0
Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the,0

SCENE II. The highway near Gadshill.,0
Come shelter shelter: I have removed Falstaff's,0
Stand close.,0
Poins! Poins and be hanged! Poins!,0
thou keep!,0
He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.,0
rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know,0
further afoot I shall break my wind. Well I doubt,0
scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have,0
twenty years and yet I am bewitched with the,0
medicines to make me love him I'll be hanged; it,0
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!,0
not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to,0
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven,0
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:,0
They whistle,0
rogues; give me my horse and be hanged!,0
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread,0
Have you any levers to lift me up again being down?,0
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.,0
Thou liest; thou art not colted thou art uncolted.,0
good king's son.,0
Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent,0
have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy,0
is so forward and afoot too! I hate it.,0
Stand.,0
O 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,0
Case ye case ye; on with your vizards: there 's,0
to the king's exchequer.,0
There's enough to make us all.,0
Sirs you four shall front them in the narrow lane;,0
from your encounter then they light on us.,0
Some eight or ten.,0
What a coward Sir John Paunch?,0
but yet no coward Hal.,0
Sirrah Jack thy horse stands behind the hedge:,0
Farewell and stand fast.,0
Ned where are our disguises?,0
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS,0
every man to his business.,0
Come neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down,0
Stand!,0
Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:,0
hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.,0
Hang ye gorbellied knaves are ye undone? No ye,0
bacons on! What ye knaves! young men must live.,0
Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt,0
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou,0
would be argument for a week laughter for a month,0
Stand close; I hear them coming.,0
Come my masters let us share and then to  horse,0
arrant cowards there's no equity stirring: there's,0
Your money!,0
As they are sharing the Prince and Poins set upon  them; they all run away; and Falstaff after a blow or two runs away too leaving the booty behind them,0
The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear,0
Each takes his fellow for an officer.,0
And lards the lean earth as he walks along:,0
How the rogue roar'd!,0
SCENE III. Warkworth castle,0
But for mine own part my lord I could be well,0
your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,0
he shows in this he loves his own barn better than,0
purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why that's,0
drink; but I tell you my lord fool out of this,0
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you,0
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so,0
unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and,0
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our,0
friends and full of expectation; an excellent plot,0
this! Why my lord of York commends the plot and the,0
this rascal I could brain him with his lady's fan.,0
Edmund Mortimer My lord of York and Owen Glendower?,0
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the,0
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an,0
of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay,0
and go to buffets for moving such a dish of,0
let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set,0
Enter LADY PERCY,0
O my good lord why are you thus alone?,0
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?,0
Thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep?,0
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?,0
And given my treasures and my rights of thee,0
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,0
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;,0
Of sallies and retires of trenches tents,0
Of basilisks of cannon culverin,0
And all the currents of a heady fight.,0
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,0
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;,0
Such as we see when men restrain their breath,0
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,0
What ho!,0
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?,0
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?,0
What horse? a roan a crop-ear is it not?,0
That roan shall by my throne.,0
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.,0
But hear you my lord.,0
What is it carries you away?,0
Out you mad-headed ape!,0
As you are toss'd with. In faith,0
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir,0
To line his enterprise: but if you go--,0
Come come you paraquito answer me,0
In faith I'll break thy little finger Harry,0
Away,0
I care not for thee Kate: this is no world,0
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,0
What say'st thou Kate? what would'st thou,0
Do you not love me? do you not indeed?,0
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?,0
Come wilt thou see me ride?,0
I love thee infinitely. But hark you Kate;,0
Whither I go nor reason whereabout:,0
This evening must I leave you gentle Kate.,0
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,0
No lady closer; for I well believe,0
And so far will I trust thee gentle Kate.,0
Not an inch further. But hark you Kate:,0
To-day will I set forth to-morrow you.,0
It must of force.,0
SCENE IV. The Boar's-Head Tavern Eastcheap.,0
Ned prithee come out of that fat room and lend me,0
Where hast been Hal?,0
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very,0
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by,0
They take it already upon their salvation that,0
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,0
good boy by the Lord so they call me and when I,0
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep dyeing,0
cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude I,0
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language,0
much honour that thou wert not with me in this sweet,0
Ned I give thee this pennyworth of sugar clapped,0
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight,0

Enter FRANCIS,0
Come hither Francis.,0
How long hast thou to serve Francis?,0
[Within]  Francis!,0
Five year! by'r lady a long lease for the clinking,0

Away you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?,0
Enter Vintner,0

My lord old Sir John with half-a-dozen more are,0
Let them alone awhile and then open the door.,0
Poins!,0
Anon anon sir.,0

cunning match have you made with this jest of the,0
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves,0
pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.,0
What's o'clock Francis?,0
Exit,0
parrot and yet the son of a woman! His industry is,0
a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind the,0
seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast washes his,0
life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry' says she,0
horse a drench' says he; and answers 'Some,0
prithee call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy and,0
wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs call in tallow.,0
Welcome Jack: where hast thou been?,0
marry and amen! Give me a cup of sack boy. Ere I,0

He drinks,0
pitiful-hearted Titan that melted at the sweet tale,0
You rogue here's lime in this sack too: there is,0
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime,0
die when thou wilt if manhood good manhood be,0
shotten herring. There live not three good men,0
grows old: God help the while! a bad world I say.,0
thing. A plague of all cowards I say still.,0
A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy,0
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,0
Why you whoreson round man what's the matter?,0
Zounds ye fat paunch an ye call me coward by the,0
I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call,0
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight,0
back: call you that backing of your friends? A,0
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue if I,0
O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou,0
All's one for that.,0
A plague of all cowards still say I.,0
What's the matter! there be four of us here have,0
Where is it Jack? where is it?,0
poor four of us.,0
I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a,0
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the,0
through and through; my sword hacked like a,0
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all,0
less than truth they are villains and the sons of darkness.,0
We four set upon some dozen--,0
And bound them.,0
You rogue they were bound every man of them; or I,0
As we were sharing some six or seven fresh men set upon us--,0
What fought you with them all?,0
not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish: if,0
Jack then am I no two-legged creature.,0
Nay that's past praying for: I have peppered two,0
in buckram suits. I tell thee what Hal if I tell,0
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my,0
What four? thou saidst but two even now.,0
Ay ay he said four.,0
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven,0
Seven? why there were but four even now.,0
Ay four in buckram suits.,0
Prithee let him alone; we shall have more anon.,0
Ay and mark thee too Jack.,0
in buckram that I told thee of--,0
Their points being broken--,0
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,0
the eleven I paid.,0
But as the devil would have it three misbegotten,0
at me; for it was so dark Hal that thou couldst,0
These lies are like their father that begets them;,0
clay-brained guts thou knotty-pated fool thou,0
What art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth,0
Why how couldst thou know these men in Kendal,0
hand? come tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?,0
What upon compulsion? 'Zounds an I were at the,0
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on,0
blackberries I would give no man a reason upon,0
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine,0
this huge hill of flesh--,0
neat's tongue you bull's pizzle you stock-fish! O,0
tailor's-yard you sheath you bowcase; you vile,0
Well breathe awhile and then to it again: and,0
hear me speak but this.,0
We two saw you four set on four and bound them and,0
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you,0
prize and have it; yea and can show it you here in,0
away as nimbly with as quick dexterity and roared,0
bull-calf. What a slave art thou to hack thy sword,0
What trick what device what starting-hole canst,0
apparent shame?,0
By the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye.,0
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?,0
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true,0
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of,0
lion and thou for a true prince. But by the Lord,0
to the doors: watch to-night pray to-morrow.,0
of good fellowship come to you! What shall we be,0
Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.,0
Enter Hostess,0
How now my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to,0
Marry my lord there is a nobleman of the court at,0
your father.,0
send him back again to my mother.,0
An old man.,0
I give him his answer?,0
Faith and I'll send him packing.,0
Now sirs: by'r lady you fought fair; so did you,0
ran away upon instinct you will not touch the true,0
Faith I ran when I saw others run.,0
sword so hacked?,0
swear truth out of England but he would make you,0
Yea and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to,0
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I,0
to hear his monstrous devices.,0
ago and wert taken with the manner and ever since,0
sword on thy side and yet thou rannest away: what,0
My lord do you see these meteors? do you behold,0
I do.,0
Hot livers and cold purses.,0
No if rightly taken halter.,0
Here comes lean Jack here comes bare-bone.,0
How long is't ago Jack since thou sawest thine own knee?,0
not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have,0
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a,0
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the,0
north Percy and he of Wales that gave Amamon the,0
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh,0
O Glendower.,0
and old Northumberland and that sprightly Scot of,0
perpendicular--,0
kills a sparrow flying.,0
So did he never the sparrow.,0
Why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so,0
O' horseback ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.,0
I grant ye upon instinct. Well he is there too,0
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's,0
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.,0
this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads,0
By the mass lad thou sayest true; it is like we,0
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being,0
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas that,0
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at,0
Not a whit i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.,0
comest to thy father: if thou love me practise an answer.,0
particulars of my life.,0
this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown.,0
sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich,0
Well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,0
make my eyes look red that it may be thought I have,0
in King Cambyses' vein.,0
And here is my speech. Stand aside nobility.,0
Weep not sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.,0
For God's sake lords convey my tristful queen;,0
O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry,0
Peace good pint-pot; peace good tickle-brain.,0
time but also how thou art accompanied: for though,0
it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the,0
partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion,0
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant,0
why being son to me art thou so pointed at? Shall,0
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall,0
question to be asked. There is a thing Harry,0
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,0
the company thou keepest: for Harry now I do not,0
pleasure but in passion not in words only but in,0
have often noted in thy company but I know not his name.,0
A goodly portly man i' faith and a corpulent; of a,0
carriage; and as I think his age some fifty or,0
remember me his name is Falstaff: if that man,0
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be,0
peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that,0
me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast,0
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,0
Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely so,0
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.,0
And here I stand: judge my masters.,0
My noble lord from Eastcheap.,0
Sblood my lord they are false: nay I'll tickle,0
Swearest thou ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look,0
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an,0
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that,0
of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed,0
the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that,0
years? Wherein is he good but to taste sack and,0
capon and eat it? wherein cunning but in craft?,0
but in all things? wherein worthy but in nothing?,0
means your grace?,0
Falstaff that old white-bearded Satan.,0
I know thou dost.,0
were to say more than I know. That he is old the,0
that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster,0
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a,0
to be fat be to be hated then Pharaoh's lean kine,0
banish Bardolph banish Poins: but for sweet Jack,0
valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant,0
thy Harry's company banish not him thy Harry's,0
I do I will.,0
Exeunt Hostess FRANCIS and BARDOLPH,0
O my lord my lord! the sheriff with a most,0
Out ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to,0
Re-enter the Hostess,0
Heigh heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:,0
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they,0
Dost thou hear Hal? never call a true piece of,0
without seeming so.,0
I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,0
as well as another man a plague on my bringing up!,0
Go hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up,0
conscience.,0
therefore I'll hide me.,0
Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO,0
Now master sheriff what is your will with me?,0
Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.,0
One of them is well known my gracious lord,0
As fat as butter.,0
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.,0
That I will by to-morrow dinner-time,0
For any thing he shall be charged withal:,0
I will my lord. There are two gentlemen,0
It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,0
Good night my noble lord.,0
Indeed my lord I think it be two o'clock.,0
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,0
Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras and,0
Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.,0
What hast thou found?,0
Let's see what they be: read them.,0
Item Sauce. . . 4d.,0
Item Anchovies and sack after supper 2s. 6d.,0
O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to,0
keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there,0
morning. We must all to the wars and thy place,0
charge of foot; and I know his death will be a,0
back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in,0
Exeunt,0
ACT III,0
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER MORTIMER and GLENDOWER,0
And our induction full of prosperous hope.,0
Will you sit down?,0
I have forgot the map.,0
Sit cousin Percy; sit good cousin Hotspur,0
Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with,0
And you in hell as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.,0
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,0
The frame and huge foundation of the earth,0
Why so it would have done at the same season if,0
had never been born.,0
And I say the earth was not of my mind,0
The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble.,0
And not in fear of your nativity.,0
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth,0
By the imprisoning of unruly wind,0
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down,0
Our grandam earth having this distemperature,0
Cousin of many men,0
To tell you once again that at my birth,0
The goats ran from the mountains and the herds,0
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;,0
I am not in the roll of common men.,0
That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales,0
And bring him out that is but woman's son,0
And hold me pace in deep experiments.,0
I'll to dinner.,0
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.,0
But will they come when you do call for them?,0
The devil.,0
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.,0
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.,0
Come come no more of this unprofitable chat.,0
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye,0
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.,0
How 'scapes he agues in the devil's name?,0
According to our threefold order ta'en?,0
Into three limits very equally:,0
By south and east is to my part assign'd:,0
And all the fertile land within that bound,0
The remnant northward lying off from Trent.,0
Which being sealed interchangeably,0
To-morrow cousin Percy you and I,0
To meet your father and the Scottish power,0
My father Glendower is not ready yet,0
Within that space you may have drawn together,0
A shorter time shall send me to you lords:,0
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,0
Upon the parting of your wives and you.,0
In quantity equals not one of yours:,0
And cuts me from the best of all my land,0
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;,0
In a new channel fair and evenly;,0
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.,0
Yea but,0
With like advantage on the other side;,0
As on the other side it takes from you.,0
And on this north side win this cape of land;,0
I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.,0
Will not you?,0
Who shall say me nay?,0
Let me not understand you then; speak it in Welsh.,0
For I was train'd up in the English court;,0
Many an English ditty lovely well,0
A virtue that was never seen in you.,0
And I am glad of it with all my heart:,0
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;,0
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;,0
Nothing so much as mincing poetry:,0
Come you shall have Trent turn'd.,0
To any well-deserving friend;,0
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.,0
The moon shines fair; you may away by night:,0
Break with your wives of your departure hence:,0
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.,0
Fie cousin Percy! how you cross my father!,0
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,0
And of a dragon and a finless fish,0
A couching lion and a ramping cat,0
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;,0
In reckoning up the several devils' names,0
But mark'd him not a word. O he is as tedious,0
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live,0
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me,0
In faith he is a worthy gentleman,0
In strange concealments valiant as a lion,0
As mines of India. Shall I tell you cousin?,0
And curbs himself even of his natural scope,0
I warrant you that man is not alive,0
Without the taste of danger and reproof:,0
In faith my lord you are too wilful-blame;,0
To put him quite beside his patience.,0
Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood--,0
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,0
Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain:,0
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain,0
Beguiling them of commendation.,0
Here come our wives and let us take our leave.,0
This is the deadly spite that angers me;,0
My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;,0
Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy,0
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers him in the same,0
one that no persuasion can do good upon.,0
I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh,0
I am too perfect in; and but for shame,0
The lady speaks again in Welsh,0
And that's a feeling disputation:,0
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue,0
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,0
Nay if you melt then will she run mad.,0
O I am ignorance itself in this!,0
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,0
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.,0
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep,0
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team,0
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:,0
Do so;,0
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,0
Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down: come,0
Go ye giddy goose.,0
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;,0
By'r lady he is a good musician.,0
altogether governed by humours. Lie still ye thief,0
I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish.,0
No.,0
Neither;'tis a woman's fault.,0
To the Welsh lady's bed.,0
Peace! she sings.,0
Come Kate I'll have your song too.,0
Not yours in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a,0
as true as I live' and 'as God shall mend me' and,0
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,0
Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art,0
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,0
Come sing.,0
Tis the next way to turn tailor or be red-breast,0
within these two hours; and so come in when ye will.,0
Come come Lord Mortimer; you are as slow,0
By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,0
With all my heart.,0
SCENE II. London. The palace.,0
Lords give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I,0
For we shall presently have need of you.,0
I know not whether God will have it so,0
That in his secret doom out of my blood,0
But thou dost in thy passages of life,0
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven,0
Could such inordinate and low desires,0
Such barren pleasures rude society,0
Accompany the greatness of thy blood,0
So please your majesty I would I could,0
As well as I am doubtless I can purge,0
Yet such extenuation let me beg,0
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,0
I may for some things true wherein my youth,0
Find pardon on my true submission.,0
At thy affections which do hold a wing,0
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.,0
And art almost an alien to the hearts,0
The hope and expectation of thy time,0
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.,0
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,0
Opinion that did help me to the crown,0
And left me in reputeless banishment,0
By being seldom seen I could not stir,0
That men would tell their children 'This is he;',0
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,0
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,0
Even in the presence of the crowned king.,0
My presence like a robe pontifical,0
Seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast,0
The skipping king he ambled up and down,0
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,0
Had his great name profaned with their scorns,0
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push,0
Grew a companion to the common streets,0
That being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,0
To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little,0
So when he had occasion to be seen,0
Heard not regarded; seen but with such eyes,0
Afford no extraordinary gaze,0
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;,0
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect,0
Being with his presence glutted gorged and full.,0
For thou has lost thy princely privilege,0
But is a-weary of thy common sight,0
Which now doth that I would not have it do,0
I shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord,0
For all the world,0
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,0
Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot,0
Than thou the shadow of succession;,0
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,0
And being no more in debt to years than thou,0
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.,0
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,0
Holds from all soldiers chief majority,0
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:,0
This infant warrior in his enterprises,0
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,0
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.,0
The Archbishop's grace of York Douglas Mortimer,0
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?,0
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?,0
Base inclination and the start of spleen,0
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,0
Do not think so; you shall not find it so:,0
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!,0
And in the closing of some glorious day,0
When I will wear a garment all of blood,0
Which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it:,0
That this same child of honour and renown,0
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.,0
Would they were multitudes and on my head,0
That I shall make this northern youth exchange,0
Percy is but my factor good my lord,0
And I will call him to so strict account,0
Yea even the slightest worship of his time,0
This in the name of God I promise here:,0
I do beseech your majesty may salve,0
If not the end of life cancels all bands;,0
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.,0
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.,0
How now good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.,0
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word,0
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury,0
If promises be kept on every hand,0
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;,0
For this advertisement is five days old:,0
On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting,0
Through Gloucestershire; by which account,0
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.,0
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.,0
Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,0
Bardolph am I not fallen away vilely since this last,0
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose,0
I'll repent and that suddenly while I am in some,0
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not,0
am a peppercorn a brewer's horse: the inside of a,0
spoil of me.,0
Why there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make,0
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not,0
in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I,0
good compass: and now I live out of all order out,0
Why you are so fat Sir John that you must needs,0
compass Sir John.,0
thou art our admiral thou bearest the lantern in,0
Knight of the Burning Lamp.,0
No I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many,0
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and,0
robes burning burning. If thou wert any way,0
should be 'By this fire that's God's angel:' but,0
for the light in thy face the son of utter,0
night to catch my horse if I did not think thou,0
there's no purchase in money. O thou art a,0
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and,0
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast,0
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have,0
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for,0
Sblood I would my face were in your belly!,0
Enter Hostess,0
yet who picked my pocket?,0
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,0
by boy servant by servant: the tithe of a hair,0
Ye lie hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many,0
to you are a woman go.,0
called so in mine own house before.,0
No Sir John; You do not know me Sir John. I know,0
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought,0
Dowlas filthy dowlas: I have given them away to,0
Now as I am a true woman holland of eight,0
John for your diet and by-drinkings and money lent,0
He had his part of it; let him pay.,0
How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?,0
Ill not pay a denier. What will you make a younker,0
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a,0
O Jesu I have heard the prince tell him I know not,0
How! the prince is a Jack a sneak-cup: 'sblood an,0
would say so.,0
How now lad! is the wind in that door i' faith?,0
Yea two and two Newgate fashion.,0
What sayest thou Mistress Quickly? How doth thy,0
Good my lord hear me.,0
What sayest thou Jack?,0
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned,0
What didst thou lose Jack?,0
forty pound apiece and a seal-ring of my,0
A trifle some eight-penny matter.,0
grace say so: and my lord he speaks most vilely,0
he would cudgel you.,0
There's neither faith truth nor womanhood in me else.,0
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn,0
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go you thing,0
Say what thing? what thing?,0
I am no thing to thank God on I would thou,0
setting thy knighthood aside thou art a knave to,0
Setting thy womanhood aside thou art a beast to say,0
Say what beast thou knave thou?,0
An otter Sir John! Why an otter?,0
where to have her.,0
man knows where to have me thou knave thou!,0
So he doth you my lord; and said this other day you,0
Sirrah do I owe you a thousand pound?,0
a million: thou owest me thy love.,0
cudgel you.,0
Indeed Sir John you said so.,0
I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?,0
but as thou art prince I fear thee as I fear the,0
And why not as the lion?,0
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay an,0
O if it should how would thy guts fall about thy,0
truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all,0
woman with picking thy pocket! why thou whoreson,0
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings memorandums of,0
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded if thy pocket,0
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will,0
Dost thou hear Hal? thou knowest in the state of,0
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I,0
frailty. You confess then you picked my pocket?,0
Hostess I forgive thee: go make ready breakfast;,0
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest,0
prithee be gone.,0
Now Hal to the news at court: for the robbery,0
O my sweet beef I must still be good angel to,0
O I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.,0
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest and,0
Do my lord.,0
I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find,0
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am,0
these rebels they offend none but the virtuous: I,0
Bardolph!,0
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster to my,0
Exit Bardolph,0
thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.,0
Jack meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two,0
There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive,0
The land is burning; Percy stands on high;,0
Exit PRINCE HENRY,0
O I could wish this tavern were my drum!,0
ACT IV,0
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER and DOUGLAS,0
In this fine age were not thought flattery,0
As not a soldier of this season's stamp,0
By God I cannot flatter; I do defy,0
In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:,0
Thou art the king of honour:,0
But I will beard him.,0
Enter a Messenger with letters,0
These letters come from your father.,0
He cannot come my lord; he is grievous sick.,0
In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?,0
His letters bear his mind not I my lord.,0
He did my lord four days ere I set forth;,0
He was much fear'd by his physicians.,0
Ere he by sickness had been visited:,0
Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect,0
Tis catching hither even to our camp.,0
And that his friends by deputation could not,0
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust,0
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,0
To see how fortune is disposed to us;,0
Because the king is certainly possess'd,0
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.,0
And yet in faith it is not; his present want,0
To set the exact wealth of all our states,0
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?,0
The very bottom and the soul of hope,0
Of all our fortunes.,0
Where now remains a sweet reversion:,0
Is to come in:,0
A rendezvous a home to fly unto.,0
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.,0
The quality and hair of our attempt,0
By some that know not why he is away,0
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:,0
May turn the tide of fearful faction,0
For well you know we of the offering side,0
And stop all sight-holes every loop from whence,0
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,0
Before not dreamt of.,0
I rather of his absence make this use:,0
A larger dare to our great enterprise,0
If we without his help can make a head,0
We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.,0
As heart can think: there is not such a word,0
Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON,0
Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord.,0
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.,0
And further I have learn'd,0
Or hitherwards intended speedily,0
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,0
And his comrades that daff'd the world aside,0
All furnish'd all in arms;,0
Baited like eagles having lately bathed;,0
As full of spirit as the month of May,0
Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls.,0
His cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd,0
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,0
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,0
No more no more: worse than the sun in March,0
They come like sacrifices in their trim,0
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:,0
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire,0
And yet not ours. Come let me taste my horse,0
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:,0
Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.,0
There is more news:,0
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.,0
Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound.,0
To thirty thousand.,0
My father and Glendower being both away,0
Come let us take a muster speedily:,0
Talk not of dying: I am out of fear,0
Exeunt,0
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH,0
bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;,0
Will you give me money captain?,0
This bottle makes an angel.,0
twenty take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid,0
I will captain: farewell.,0
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused,0
I have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty,0
none but good house-holders yeoman's sons; inquire,0
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,0
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck,0
toasts-and-butter with hearts in their bellies no,0
their services; and now my whole charge consists of,0
companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the,0
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers but,0
younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers,0
long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than,0
the rooms of them that have bought out their,0
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from,0
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded,0
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through,0
villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had,0
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my,0
together and thrown over the shoulders like an,0
the truth stolen from my host at Saint Alban's or,0
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.,0
How now blown Jack! how now quilt!,0
in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland I,0
at Shrewsbury.,0
there and you too; but my powers are there already.,0
away all night.,0
steal cream.,0
already made thee butter. But tell me Jack whose,0
Mine Hal mine.,0
Tut tut; good enough to toss; food for powder food,0
tush man mortal men mortal men.,0
and bare too beggarly.,0
that; and for their bareness I am sure they never,0
No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on,0
already in the field.,0
He is Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.,0
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast,0
Exeunt,0
Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER DOUGLAS and VERNON,0
It may not be.,0
Not a whit.,0
So do we.,0
Good cousin be advised; stir not tonight.,0
You do not counsel well:,0
Do me no slander Douglas: by my life,0
If well-respected honour bid me on,0
As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives:,0
Which of us fears.,0
Content.,0
Come come it nay not be. I wonder much,0
That you foresee not what impediments,0
Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:,0
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,0
That not a horse is half the half of himself.,0
In general journey-bated and brought low:,0
The number of the king exceedeth ours:,0
The trumpet sounds a parley,0
I come with gracious offers from the king,0
Welcome Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God,0
Some of us love you well; and even those some,0
Because you are not of our quality,0
And God defend but still I should stand so,0
You stand against anointed majesty.,0
The nature of your griefs and whereupon,0
Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land,0
Have any way your good deserts forgot,0
He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed,0
And pardon absolute for yourself and these,0
The king is kind; and well we know the king,0
My father and my uncle and myself,0
And when he was not six and twenty strong,0
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,0
And when he heard him swear and vow to God,0
To sue his livery and beg his peace,0
My father in kind heart and pity moved,0
Now when the lords and barons of the realm,0
The more and less came in with cap and knee;,0
Attended him on bridges stood in lanes,0
Gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him,0
He presently as greatness knows itself,0
Made to my father while his blood was poor,0
And now forsooth takes on him to reform,0
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,0
Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,0
The hearts of all that he did angle for;,0
Of all the favourites that the absent king,0
When he was personal in the Irish war.,0
Then to the point.,0
Soon after that deprived him of his life;,0
To make that worse suffer'd his kinsman March,0
Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales,0
Disgraced me in my happy victories,0
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;,0
Broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong,0
This head of safety; and withal to pry,0
Too indirect for long continuance.,0
Not so Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.,0
Some surety for a safe return again,0
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.,0
And may be so we shall.,0
Exeunt,0
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL,0
With winged haste to the lord marshal;,0
To whom they are directed. If you knew,0
My good lord,0
Like enough you do.,0
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men,0
As I am truly given to understand,0
Meets with Lord Harry: and I fear Sir Michael,0
Whose power was in the first proportion,0
Who with them was a rated sinew too,0
I fear the power of Percy is too weak,0
Why my good lord you need not fear;,0
No Mortimer is not there.,0
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head,0
And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn,0
The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster,0
And moe corrivals and dear men,0
Doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed.,0
And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed:,0
Dismiss his power he means to visit us,0
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:,0
To other friends; and so farewell Sir Michael.,0
ACT V,0
Enter KING HENRY PRINCE HENRY Lord John of  LANCASTER EARL OF WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and FALSTAFF,0
Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale,0
The southern wind,0
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves,0
Then with the losers let it sympathize,0
The trumpet sounds,0
How now my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well,0
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,0
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:,0
What say you to it? will you again unknit,0
And move in that obedient orb again,0
And be no more an exhaled meteor,0
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?,0
For mine own part I could be well content,0
With quiet hours; for I do protest,0
You have not sought it! how comes it then?,0
Peace chewet peace!,0
Of favour from myself and all our house;,0
We were the first and dearest of your friends.,0
In Richard's time; and posted day and night,0
When yet you were in place and in account,0
It was myself my brother and his son,0
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,0
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;,0
The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster:,0
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;,0
What with our help what with the absent king,0
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,0
So long in his unlucky Irish wars,0
And from this swarm of fair advantages,0
To gripe the general sway into your hand;,0
And being fed by us you used us so,0
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;,0
That even our love durst not come near your sight,0
We were enforced for safety sake to fly,0
Whereby we stand opposed by such means,0
By unkind usage dangerous countenance,0
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.,0
Proclaim'd at market-crosses read in churches,0
With some fine colour that may please the eye,0
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news,0
And never yet did insurrection want,0
Nor moody beggars starving for a time,0
In both your armies there is many a soul,0
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,0
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,0
I do not think a braver gentleman,0
More daring or more bold is now alive,0
For my part I may speak it to my shame,0
And so I hear he doth account me too;,0
I am content that he shall take the odds,0
And will to save the blood on either side,0
And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee,0
Do make against it. No good Worcester no,0
That are misled upon your cousin's part;,0
Both he and they and you every man,0
So tell your cousin and bring me word,0
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,0
We will not now be troubled with reply:,0
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON,0
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together,0
Hence therefore every leader to his charge;,0
And God befriend us as our cause is just!,0
Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride,0
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.,0
I  would 'twere bed-time Hal and all well.,0
Exit PRINCE HENRY,0
his day. What need I be so forward with him that,0
me on. Yea but how if honour prick me off when I,0
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.,0
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what,0
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.,0
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?,0
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so,0
Exit,0
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON,0
The liberal and kind offer of the king.,0
Then are we all undone.,0
The king should keep his word in loving us;,0
To punish this offence in other faults:,0
For treason is but trusted like the fox,0
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.,0
Interpretation will misquote our looks,0
The better cherish'd still the nearer death.,0
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,0
A hair-brain'd Hotspur govern'd by a spleen:,0
And on his father's; we did train him on,0
We as the spring of all shall pay for all.,0
In any case the offer of the king.,0
Here comes your cousin.,0
My uncle is return'd:,0
Uncle what news?,0
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.,0
Marry and shall and very willingly.,0
There is no seeming mercy in the king.,0
I told him gently of our grievances,0
By now forswearing that he is forsworn:,0
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.,0
Arm gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown,0
And Westmoreland that was engaged did bear it;,0
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,0
O would the quarrel lay upon our heads,0
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me tell me,0
No by my soul; I never in my life,0
Unless a brother should a brother dare,0
He gave you all the duties of a man;,0
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,0
By still dispraising praise valued in you;,0
He made a blushing cital of himself;,0
As if he master'd there a double spirit.,0
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,0
England did never owe so sweet a hope,0
Cousin I think thou art enamoured,0
Of any prince so wild a libertine.,0
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,0
Arm arm with speed: and fellows soldiers friends,0
Than I that have not well the gift of tongue,0
Enter a Messenger,0
I cannot read them now.,0
To spend that shortness basely were too long,0
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.,0
If die brave death when princes die with us!,0
When the intent of bearing them is just.,0
My lord prepare; the king comes on apace.,0
For I profess not talking; only this--,0
A sword whose temper I intend to stain,0
In the adventure of this perilous day.,0
Sound all the lofty instruments of war,0
For heaven to earth some of us never shall,0
The trumpets sound. They embrace and exeunt,0
KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT,0
Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek,0
Know then my name is Douglas;,0
Because some tell me that thou art a king.,0
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought,0
This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,0
I was not born a yielder thou proud Scot;,0
Lord Stafford's death.,0
O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,0
All's done all's won; here breathless lies the king.,0
Here.,0
A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt;,0
A fool go with thy soul whither it goes!,0
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?,0
Now by my sword I will kill all his coats;,0
Until I meet the king.,0
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.,0
Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF solus,0
the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.,0
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten,0
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have,0
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and,0
But who comes here?,0
What stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:,0
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,0
lend me thy sword.,0
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have,0
He is indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,0
Nay before God Hal if Percy be alive thou get'st,0
Give it to me: what is it in the case?,0
PRINCE HENRY draws it out and finds it to be a bottle of sack,0
He throws the bottle at him. Exit,0
come in my way so: if he do not if I come in his,0
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me,0
unlooked for and there's an end.,0
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,0
I prithee,0
Lord John of Lancaster go you with him.,0
I beseech your majesty make up,0
I will do so.,0
Come my lord I'll lead you to your tent.,0
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive,0
Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,0
We breathe too long: come cousin Westmoreland,0
Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND,0
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:,0
But now I do respect thee as my soul.,0
With lustier maintenance than I did look for,0
O this boy,0
Exit,0
Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:,0
That wear those colours on them: what art thou,0
The king himself; who Douglas grieves at heart,0
And not the very king. I have two boys,0
But seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,0
I fear thou art another counterfeit;,0
But mine I am sure thou art whoe'er thou be,0
They fight. KING HENRY being in danger PRINCE HENRY enters,0
Never to hold it up again! the spirits,0
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;,0
They fight: DOUGLAS flies,0
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,0
Stay and breathe awhile:,0
And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,0
O God! they did me too much injury,0
If it were so I might have let alone,0
Which would have been as speedy in your end,0
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.,0
Exit,0
If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth.,0
My name is Harry Percy.,0
A very valiant rebel of the name.,0
To share with me in glory any more:,0
Nor can one England brook a double reign,0
Nor shall it Harry; for the hour is come,0
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!,0
And all the budding honours on thy crest,0
I can no longer brook thy vanities.,0
Enter FALSTAFF,0
boy's play here I can tell you.,0
O Harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth!,0
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;,0
But thought's the slave of life and life time's fool;,0
Must have a stop. O I could prophesy,0
Lies on my tongue: no Percy thou art dust,0
Dies,0
Ill-weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk!,0
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;,0
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead,0
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,0
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;,0
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.,0
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,0
He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground,0
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack farewell!,0
O I should have a heavy miss of thee,0
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,0
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:,0
Exit PRINCE HENRY,0
I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too,0
that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.,0
is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the,0
but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby,0
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of,0
have saved my life.'Zounds I am afraid of this,0
should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith I am,0
Therefore I'll make him sure; yea and I'll swear I,0
Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me.,0
Stabbing him,0
Takes up HOTSPUR on his back,0
Come brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd,0
But soft! whom have we here?,0
I did; I saw him dead,0
thou alive?,0
I prithee speak; we will not trust our eyes,0
No that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I,0
Throwing the body down,0
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either,0
Why Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.,0
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;,0
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be,0
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take,0
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,0
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.,0
Come bring your luggage nobly on your back:,0
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.,0
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.,0
To see what friends are living who are dead.,0
I'll follow as they say for reward. He that,0
I'll grow less; for I'll purge and leave sack and,0
Exit,0
The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV PRINCE  HENRY LORD JOHN LANCASTER EARL OF WESTMORELAND with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners,0
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,0
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?,0
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,0
Had been alive this hour,0
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.,0
And I embrace this fortune patiently,0
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:,0
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON guarded,0
The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw,0
The noble Percy slain and all his men,0
And falling from a hill he was so bruised,0
The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace,0
With all my heart.,0
This honourable bounty shall belong:,0
Up to his pleasure ransomless and free:,0
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,0
I thank your grace for this high courtesy,0
Then this remains that we divide our power.,0
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,0
Who as we hear are busily in arms:,0
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.,0
Meeting the cheque of such another day:,0
Let us not leave till all our own be won.,0
ACT I,1
Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD Regent of  France; GLOUCESTER Protector; and EXETER Earl of WARWICK the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER Heralds  and c,1
Comets importing change of times and states,1
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars,1
King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long!,1
England ne'er had a king until his time.,1
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:,1
His sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire,1
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.,1
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.,1
Henry is dead and never shall revive:,1
And death's dishonourable victory,1
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.,1
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?,1
Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him,1
BISHOP,1
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day,1
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:,1
The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,1
None do you like but an effeminate prince,1
BISHOP,1
And lookest to command the prince and realm.,1
More than God or religious churchmen may.,1
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,1
Cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:,1
Instead of gold we'll offer up our arms:,1
Posterity await for wretched years,1
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,1
Henry the Fifth thy ghost I invocate:,1
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!,1
Than Julius Caesar or bright--,1
My honourable lords health to you all!,1
Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture:,1
Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost.,1
Speak softly or the loss of those great towns,1
Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?,1
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.,1
No treachery; but want of men and money.,1
That here you maintain several factions,1
You are disputing of your generals:,1
Another would fly swift but wanteth wings;,1
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.,1
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:,1
Of England's coat one half is cut away.,1
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.,1
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.,1
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,1
Enter to them another Messenger,1
France is revolted from the English quite,1
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;,1
Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part;,1
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!,1
We will not fly but to our enemies' throats.,1
Gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?,1
Wherewith already France is overrun.,1
My gracious lords to add to your laments,1
I must inform you of a dismal fight,1
BISHOP,1
O no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:,1
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,1
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.,1
Was round encompassed and set upon.,1
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;,1
They pitched in the ground confusedly,1
More than three hours the fight continued;,1
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:,1
Here there and every where enraged he flew:,1
All the whole army stood agazed on him:,1
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain,1
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,1
He being in the vaward placed behind,1
Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke.,1
Enclosed were they with their enemies:,1
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,1
Durst not presume to look once in the face.,1
For living idly here in pomp and ease,1
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.,1
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:,1
His ransom there is none but I shall pay:,1
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;,1
Farewell my masters; to my task will I;,1
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:,1
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.,1
The English army is grown weak and faint:,1
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,1
Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn,1
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.,1
To go about my preparation.,1
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,1
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.,1
To Eltham will I where the young king is,1
And for his safety there I'll best devise.,1
BISHOP,1
I am left out; for me nothing remains.,1
The king from Eltham I intend to steal,1
Exeunt,1
Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES ALENCON and REIGNIER marching with drum and Soldiers,1
So in the earth to this day is not known:,1
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.,1
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;,1
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.,1
Either they must be dieted like mules,1
Or piteous they will look like drowned mice.,1
Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear:,1
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,1
Sound sound alarum! we will rush on them.,1
Him I forgive my death that killeth me,1
Exeunt,1
Who ever saw the like? what men have I!,1
But that they left me 'midst my enemies.,1
He fighteth as one weary of his life.,1
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.,1
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,1
More truly now may this be verified;,1
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!,1
They had such courage and audacity?,1
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:,1
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.,1
Their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on;,1
By my consent we'll even let them alone.,1
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS,1
Bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us.,1
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?,1
A holy maid hither with me I bring,1
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege,1
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,1
What's past and what's to come she can descry.,1
For they are certain and unfallible.,1
Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS,1
Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place:,1
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.,1
Fair maid is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?,1
Where is the Dauphin? Come come from behind;,1
Be not amazed there's nothing hid from me:,1
Stand back you lords and give us leave awhile.,1
Dauphin I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,1
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased,1
Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs,1
God's mother deigned to appear to me,1
Will'd me to leave my base vocation,1
Her aid she promised and assured success:,1
And whereas I was black and swart before,1
That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.,1
And I will answer unpremeditated:,1
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.,1
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.,1
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,1
And if thou vanquishest thy words are true;,1
I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,1
The which at Touraine in Saint Katharine's,1
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.,1
And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man.,1
Stay stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon,1
Christ's mother helps me else I were too weak.,1
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;,1
Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so,1
Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.,1
For my profession's sacred from above:,1
Then will I think upon a recompense.,1
My lord methinks is very long in talk.,1
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.,1
He may mean more than we poor men do know:,1
My lord where are you? what devise you on?,1
Why no I say distrustful recreants!,1
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.,1
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:,1
Since I have entered into these wars.,1
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,1
With Henry's death the English circle ends;,1
Now am I like that proud insulting ship,1
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?,1
Helen the mother of great Constantine,1
Bright star of Venus fall'n down on the earth,1
Leave off delays and let us raise the siege.,1
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.,1
No prophet will I trust if she prove false.,1
SCENE III. London. Before the Tower.,1
I am come to survey the Tower this day:,1
Where be these warders that they wait not here?,1
[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?,1
[Within]  Whoe'er he be you may not be let in.,1
[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:,1
Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?,1
Break up the gates I'll be your warrantize.,1
Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within,1
Lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear?,1
Have patience noble duke; I may not open;,1
From him I have express commandment,1
Faint-hearted Woodvile prizest him 'fore me?,1
Whom Henry our late sovereign ne'er could brook?,1
Open the gates or I'll shut thee out shortly.,1
Or we'll burst them open if that you come not quickly.,1
BISHOP,1
Peel'd priest dost thou command me to be shut out?,1
I do thou most usurping proditor,1
Stand back thou manifest conspirator,1
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:,1
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.,1
Nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot:,1
To slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt.,1
Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth,1
BISHOP,1
What! am I dared and bearded to my face?,1
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest beware your beard,1
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:,1
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.,1
Gloucester thou wilt answer this before the pope.,1
Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?,1
Out tawny coats! out scarlet hypocrite!,1
Fie lords! that you being supreme magistrates,1
Peace mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:,1
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.,1
Here's Gloucester a foe to citizens,1
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,1
Because he is protector of the realm,1
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.,1
Here they skirmish again,1
But to make open proclamation:,1
Cry.,1
against God's peace and the king's we charge and,1
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,1
henceforward upon pain of death.,1
But we shall meet and break our minds at large.,1
Gloucester we will meet; to thy cost be sure:,1
I'll call for clubs if you will not away.,1
Mayor farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.,1
Abominable Gloucester guard thy head;,1
Exeunt severally GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men,1
Good God these nobles should such stomachs bear!,1
Exeunt,1
Enter on the walls a Master Gunner and his Boy,1
And how the English have the suburbs won.,1
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.,1
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;,1
The prince's espials have informed me,1
Wont through a secret grate of iron bars,1
And thence discover how with most advantage,1
To intercept this inconvenience,1
And even these three days have I watch'd,1
Now do thou watch for I can stay no longer.,1
And thou shalt find me at the governor's.,1
Father I warrant you; take you no care;,1
Exit,1
Talbot my life my joy again return'd!,1
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?,1
The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner,1
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.,1
Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:,1
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.,1
But O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,1
If I now had him brought into my power.,1
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.,1
To be a public spectacle to all:,1
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.,1
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,1
My grisly countenance made others fly;,1
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;,1
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,1
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,1
And if I did but stir out of my bed,1
Enter the Boy with a linstock,1
But we will be revenged sufficiently,1
Here through this grate I count each one,1
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.,1
Let me have your express opinions,1
I think at the north gate; for there stand lords.,1
For aught I see this city must be famish'd,1
Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall,1
O Lord have mercy on me woful man!,1
Speak Salisbury; at least if thou canst speak:,1
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!,1
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!,1
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;,1
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.,1
One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace:,1
Heaven be thou gracious to none alive,1
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.,1
Speak unto Talbot; nay look up to him.,1
Thou shalt not die whiles--,1
As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,1
Plantagenet I will; and like thee Nero,1
Wretched shall France be only in my name.,1
What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?,1
Enter a Messenger,1
The Dauphin with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,1
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.,1
Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!,1
Frenchmen I'll be a Salisbury to you:,1
Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,1
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,1
Alarum. Exeunt,1
Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE driving Englishmen before her and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT,1
Our English troops retire I cannot stay them:,1
Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE,1
Devil or devil's dam I'll conjure thee:,1
And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.,1
Here they fight,1
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage,1
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.,1
Talbot farewell; thy hour is not yet come:,1
A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers,1
Go go cheer up thy hungry-starved men;,1
This day is ours as many more shall be.,1
My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;,1
A witch by fear not force like Hannibal,1
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench,1
They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;,1
A short alarum,1
Or tear the lions out of England's coat;,1
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,1
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.,1
It will not be: retire into your trenches:,1
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.,1
In spite of us or aught that we could do.,1
The shame hereof will make me hide my head.,1
SCENE VI. The same.,1
Advance our waving colours on the walls;,1
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.,1
How shall I honour thee for this success?,1
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.,1
Recover'd is the town of Orleans:,1
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?,1
And feast and banquet in the open streets,1
All France will be replete with mirth and joy,1
Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won;,1
And all the priests and friars in my realm,1
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear,1
In memory of her when she is dead,1
Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,1
Before the kings and queens of France.,1
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.,1
After this golden day of victory.,1
ACT II,1
Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels,1
If any noise or soldier you perceive,1
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.,1
Exit Sergeant,1
When others sleep upon their quiet beds,1
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY and Forces with scaling-ladders their drums beating a dead march,1
By whose approach the regions of Artois,1
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,1
Embrace we then this opportunity,1
Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.,1
Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,1
Traitors have never other company.,1
A maid they say.,1
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,1
She carry armour as she hath begun.,1
God is our fortress in whose conquering name,1
Ascend brave Talbot; we will follow thee.,1
That we do make our entrance several ways;,1
The other yet may rise against their force.,1
And I to this.,1
Now Salisbury for thee and for the right,1
How much in duty I am bound to both.,1
Cry: 'St. George' 'A Talbot.',1
How now my lords! what all unready so?,1
Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds,1
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,1
More venturous or desperate than this.,1
If not of hell the heavens sure favour him.,1
Tut holy Joan was his defensive guard.,1
Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame?,1
Make us partakers of a little gain,1
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!,1
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,1
Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,1
Duke of Alencon this was your default,1
Did look no better to that weighty charge.,1
As that whereof I had the government,1
Mine was secure.,1
And for myself most part of all this night,1
I was employ'd in passing to and fro,1
Then how or which way should they first break in?,1
How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place,1
And now there rests no other shift but this;,1
And lay new platforms to endamage them.,1
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.,1
For I have loaden me with many spoils,1
Exit,1
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY a Captain and others,1
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.,1
Retreat sounded,1
And here advance it in the market-place,1
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;,1
There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.,1
What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,1
A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:,1
Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,1
And what a terror he had been to France.,1
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,1
Nor any of his false confederates.,1
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,1
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.,1
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,1
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,1
That could not live asunder day or night.,1
We'll follow them with all the power we have.,1
All hail my lords! which of this princely train,1
So much applauded through the realm of France?,1
The virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne,1
By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe,1
That she may boast she hath beheld the man,1
Is it even so? Nay then I see our wars,1
When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.,1
Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men,1
Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:,1
And in submission will attend on her.,1
No truly; it is more than manners will:,1
Are often welcomest when they are gone.,1
I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.,1
Whispers,1
I do my lord and mean accordingly.,1
SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.,1
COUNTESS,1
And when you have done so bring the keys to me.,1
Exit,1
The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,1
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.,1
And his achievements of no less account:,1
To give their censure of these rare reports.,1
Madam,1
By message craved so is Lord Talbot come.,1
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?,1
COUNTESS,1
Is this the Talbot so much fear'd abroad,1
I see report is fabulous and false:,1
A second Hector for his grim aspect,1
Alas this is a child a silly dwarf!,1
Should strike such terror to his enemies.,1
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,1
COUNTESS,1
Stay my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves,1
Marry for that she's in a wrong belief,1
Re-enter Porter with keys,1
If thou be he then art thou prisoner.,1
COUNTESS,1
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.,1
For in my gallery thy picture hangs:,1
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,1
Wasted our country slain our citizens,1
Ha ha ha!,1
Laughest thou wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.,1
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow,1
COUNTESS,1
I am indeed.,1
Then have I substance too.,1
You are deceived my substance is not here;,1
And least proportion of humanity:,1
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,1
COUNTESS,1
He will be here and yet he is not here:,1
That will I show you presently.,1
How say you madam? are you now persuaded,1
These are his substance sinews arms and strength,1
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns,1
COUNTESS,1
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,1
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;,1
I did not entertain thee as thou art.,1
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake,1
What you have done hath not offended me;,1
But only with your patience that we may,1
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.,1
With all my heart and think me honoured,1
Exeunt,1
Enter the Earls of SOMERSET SUFFOLK and WARWICK; RICHARD PLANTAGENET VERNON and another Lawyer,1
Great lords and gentlemen what means this silence?,1
Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;,1
RICHARD,1
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?,1
And never yet could frame my will to it;,1
Judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us.,1
Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth;,1
Between two horses which doth bear him best;,1
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;,1
Good faith I am no wiser than a daw.,1
Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance:,1
That any purblind eye may find it out.,1
So clear so shining and so evident,1
RICHARD,1
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:,1
And stands upon the honour of his birth,1
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.,1
But dare maintain the party of the truth,1
I love no colours and without all colour,1
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.,1
And say withal I think he held the right.,1
Till you conclude that he upon whose side,1
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.,1
If I have fewest I subscribe in silence.,1
And I.,1
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,1
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,1
And fall on my side so against your will.,1
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt,1
Well well come on: who else?,1
The argument you held was wrong in you:,1
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.,1
Now Somerset where is your argument?,1
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.,1
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;,1
The truth on our side.,1
Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks,1
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.,1
Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset?,1
RICHARD,1
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.,1
That shall maintain what I have said is true,1
RICHARD,1
I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy.,1
RICHARD,1
I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.,1
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.,1
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,1
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?,1
He bears him on the place's privilege,1
By him that made me I'll maintain my words,1
Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge,1
And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,1
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;,1
RICHARD,1
Condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor;,1
Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.,1
I'll note you in my book of memory,1
Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.,1
And know us by these colours for thy foes,1
RICHARD,1
As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,1
Until it wither with me to my grave,1
Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!,1
Exit,1
Exit,1
How I am braved and must perforce endure it!,1
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament,1
And if thou be not then created York,1
Meantime in signal of my love to thee,1
Will I upon thy party wear this rose:,1
Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,1
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.,1
Good Master Vernon I am bound to you,1
In your behalf still will I wear the same.,1
RICHARD,1
Come let us four to dinner: I dare say,1
Exeunt,1
Enter MORTIMER brought in a chair and Gaolers,1
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.,1
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.,1
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,1
These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,1
Weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief,1
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;,1
Unable to support this lump of clay,1
As witting I no other comfort have.,1
Richard Plantagenet my lord will come:,1
And answer was return'd that he will come.,1
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.,1
Before whose glory I was great in arms,1
And even since then hath Richard been obscured,1
But now the arbitrator of despairs,1
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:,1
That so he might recover what was lost.,1
My lord your loving nephew now is come.,1
RICHARD,1
Your nephew late despised Richard comes.,1
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:,1
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.,1
Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised?,1
First lean thine aged back against mine arm;,1
This day in argument upon a case,1
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue,1
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,1
Therefore good uncle for my father's sake,1
And for alliance sake declare the cause,1
That cause fair nephew that imprison'd me,1
Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine,1
RICHARD,1
For I am ignorant and cannot guess.,1
And death approach not ere my tale be done.,1
Deposed his nephew Richard Edward's son,1
Of Edward king the third of that descent:,1
Finding his usurpation most unjust,1
The reason moved these warlike lords to this,1
Leaving no heir begotten of his body--,1
For by my mother I derived am,1
To King Edward the Third; whereas he,1
Being but fourth of that heroic line.,1
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,1
Long after this when Henry the Fifth,1
Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived,1
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,1
Levied an army weening to redeem,1
But as the rest so fell that noble earl,1
In whom the tide rested were suppress'd.,1
Of which my lord your honour is the last.,1
And that my fainting words do warrant death;,1
But yet be wary in thy studious care.,1
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:,1
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.,1
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,1
But now thy uncle is removing hence:,1
With long continuance in a settled place.,1
O uncle would some part of my young years,1
Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth,1
Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good;,1
And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes,1
Dies,1
And peace no war befall thy parting soul!,1
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.,1
And what I do imagine let that rest.,1
Will see his burial better than his life.,1
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,1
And for those wrongs those bitter injuries,1
I doubt not but with honour to redress;,1
Either to be restored to my blood,1
Exit,1
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.,1
BISHOP,1
With written pamphlets studiously devised,1
Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,1
As I with sudden and extemporal speech,1
Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,1
Think not although in writing I preferr'd,1
That therefore I have forged or am not able,1
No prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,1
As very infants prattle of thy pride.,1
Forward by nature enemy to peace;,1
A man of thy profession and degree;,1
In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,1
Beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted,1
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.,1
Gloucester I do defy thee. Lords vouchsafe,1
If I were covetous ambitious or perverse,1
Or how haps it I seek not to advance,1
And for dissension who preferreth peace,1
No my good lords it is not that offends;,1
It is because no one should sway but he;,1
And that engenders thunder in his breast,1
But he shall know I am as good--,1
Thou bastard of my grandfather!,1
Ay lordly sir; for what are you I pray,1
Am I not protector saucy priest?,1
And am not I a prelate of the church?,1
And useth it to patronage his theft.,1
Unreverent Gloster!,1
Touching thy spiritual function not thy life.,1
Rome shall remedy this.,1
My lord it were your duty to forbear.,1
Methinks my lord should be religious,1
Methinks his lordship should be humbler;,1
Yes when his holy state is touch'd so near.,1
Is not his grace protector to the king?,1
[Aside]  Plantagenet I see must hold his tongue,1
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?',1
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,1
I would prevail if prayers might prevail,1
O what a scandal is it to our crown,1
Believe me lords my tender years can tell,1
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.,1
What tumult's this?,1
Begun through malice of the bishop's men.,1
O my good lords and virtuous Henry,1
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,1
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones,1
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate,1
Our windows are broke down in every street,1
Enter Serving-men in skirmish with bloody pates,1
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.,1
First Serving-man Nay if we be forbidden stones,1
Second Serving-man Do what ye dare we are as resolute.,1
You of my household leave this peevish broil,1
Third Serving-man My lord we know your grace to be a man,1
Inferior to none but to his majesty:,1
So kind a father of the commonweal,1
We and our wives and children all will fight,1
First Serving-man Ay and the very parings of our nails,1
Begin again,1
And if you love me as you say you do,1
O how this discord doth afflict my soul!,1
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?,1
Or who should study to prefer a peace.,1
Yield my lord protector; yield Winchester;,1
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.,1
Hath been enacted through your enmity;,1
BISHOP,1
Compassion on the king commands me stoop;,1
Should ever get that privilege of me.,1
Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,1
Why look you still so stern and tragical?,1
Fie uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach,1
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,1
Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.,1
What shall a child instruct you what to do?,1
Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee;,1
[Aside]  Ay but I fear me with a hollow heart.--,1
This token serveth for a flag of truce,1
So help me God as I dissemble not!,1
[Aside]  So help me God as I intend it not!,1
How joyful am I made by this contract!,1
But join in friendship as your lords have done.,1
Second Serving-man And so will I.,1
Exeunt Serving-men Mayor  and c,1
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet,1
Well urged my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,1
You have great reason to do Richard right;,1
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.,1
Therefore my loving lords our pleasure is,1
Let Richard be restored to his blood;,1
BISHOP,1
If Richard will be true not that alone,1
That doth belong unto the house of York,1
RICHARD,1
And humble service till the point of death.,1
And in reguerdon of that duty done,1
Rise Richard like a true Plantagenet,1
RICHARD,1
And as my duty springs so perish they,1
Welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York!,1
Now will it best avail your majesty,1
The presence of a king engenders love,1
As it disanimates his enemies.,1
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.,1
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER,1
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.,1
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love,1
As fester'd members rot but by degree,1
So will this base and envious discord breed.,1
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth,1
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,1
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish,1
Exit,1
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs,1
Through which our policy must make a breach:,1
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men,1
If we have entrance as I hope we shall,1
I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,1
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,1
Therefore we'll knock.,1
[Within]  Qui est la?,1
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.,1
Now Rouen I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.,1
Enter CHARLES the BASTARD OF ORLEANS ALENCON REIGNIER and forces,1
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.,1
Now she is there how will she specify,1
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;,1
No way to that for weakness which she enter'd.,1
Behold this is the happy wedding torch,1
But burning fatal to the Talbotites!,1
See noble Charles the beacon of our friend;,1
Now shine it like a comet of revenge,1
Defer no time delays have dangerous ends;,1
And then do execution on the watch.,1
An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion,1
If Talbot but survive thy treachery.,1
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,1
Exit,1
Good morrow gallants! want ye corn for bread?,1
Before he'll buy again at such a rate:,1
Scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan!,1
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.,1
O let no words but deeds revenge this treason!,1
And run a tilt at death within a chair?,1
Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!,1
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?,1
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.,1
If Talbot do but thunder rain will follow.,1
God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?,1
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,1
I speak not to that railing Hecate,1
Will ye like soldiers come and fight it out?,1
Signior hang! base muleters of France!,1
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.,1
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.,1
That we are here.,1
And there will we be too ere it be long,1
Vow Burgundy by honour of thy house,1
Either to get the town again or die:,1
And as his father here was conqueror,1
Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,1
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.,1
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come my lord,1
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.,1
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen,1
Courageous Bedford let us now persuade you.,1
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick,1
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,1
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!,1
And now no more ado brave Burgundy,1
And set upon our boasting enemy.,1
An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain,1
Whither away! to save myself by flight:,1
What! will you fly and leave Lord Talbot?,1
All the Talbots in the world to save my life!,1
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!,1
Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE ALENCON and CHARLES fly,1
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.,1
They that of late were daring with their scoffs,1
BEDFORD dies and is carried in by two in his chair,1
Lost and recover'd in a day again!,1
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!,1
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects,1
Thanks gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?,1
Now where's the Bastard's braves and Charles his gleeks?,1
That such a valiant company are fled.,1
Placing therein some expert officers,1
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.,1
But yet before we go let's not forget,1
But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:,1
A gentler heart did never sway in court;,1
For that's the end of human misery.,1
SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.,1
Dismay not princes at this accident,1
Care is no cure but rather corrosive,1
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,1
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,1
We have been guided by thee hitherto,1
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.,1
And we will make thee famous through the world.,1
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:,1
Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:,1
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy,1
Ay marry sweeting if we could do that,1
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,1
For ever should they be expulsed from France,1
Your honours shall perceive how I will work,1
Drum sounds afar off,1
Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.,1
There goes the Talbot with his colours spread,1
French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces,1
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.,1
Trumpets sound a parley,1
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?,1
What say'st thou Charles? for I am marching hence.,1
Brave Burgundy undoubted hope of France!,1
Speak on; but be not over-tedious.,1
And see the cities and the towns defaced,1
As looks the mother on her lowly babe,1
See see the pining malady of France;,1
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.,1
Strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help.,1
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:,1
And wash away thy country's stained spots.,1
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.,1
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.,1
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?,1
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,1
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?,1
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?,1
But when they heard he was thine enemy,1
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.,1
And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.,1
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.,1
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,1
Forgive me country and sweet countrymen,1
My forces and my power of men are yours:,1
[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn and turn again!,1
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.,1
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.,1
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.,1
SCENE IV. Paris. The palace.,1
My gracious prince and honourable peers,1
I have awhile given truce unto my wars,1
In sign whereof this arm that hath reclaim'd,1
Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,1
Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,1
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got,1
Kneels,1
That hath so long been resident in France?,1
Welcome brave captain and victorious lord!,1
I do remember how my father said,1
Long since we were resolved of your truth,1
Yet never have you tasted our reward,1
Because till now we never saw your face:,1
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;,1
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET,1
Disgracing of these colours that I wear,1
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?,1
The envious barking of your saucy tongue,1
Sirrah thy lord I honour as he is.,1
Hark ye; not so: in witness take ye that.,1
Villain thou know'st the law of arms is such,1
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.,1
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;,1
Well miscreant I'll be there as soon as you;,1
Exeunt,1
SCENE I. Paris. A hall of state.,1
Lord bishop set the crown upon his head.,1
God save King Henry of that name the sixth!,1
That you elect no other king but him;,1
And none your foes but such as shall pretend,1
This shall ye do so help you righteous God!,1
My gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais,1
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,1
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!,1
To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,1
Which I have done because unworthily,1
Pardon me princely Henry and the rest,1
When but in all I was six thousand strong,1
Before we met or that a stroke was given,1
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;,1
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.,1
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear,1
To say the truth this fact was infamous,1
Much more a knight a captain and a leader.,1
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,1
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;,1
But always resolute in most extremes.,1
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,1
And should if I were worthy to be judge,1
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.,1
Be packing therefore thou that wast a knight:,1
Exit FASTOLFE,1
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.,1
No more but plain and bluntly 'To the king!',1
Or doth this churlish superscription,1
What's here?,1
I have upon especial cause,1
Together with the pitiful complaints,1
Forsaken your pernicious faction,1
O monstrous treachery! can this be so,1
There should be found such false dissembling guile?,1
He doth my lord and is become your foe.,1
It is the worst and all my lord he writes.,1
And give him chastisement for this abuse.,1
Content my liege! yes but that I am prevented,1
Then gather strength and march unto him straight:,1
And what offence it is to flout his friends.,1
You may behold confusion of your foes.,1
Enter VERNON and BASSET,1
And me my lord grant me the combat too.,1
And this is mine: sweet Henry favour him.,1
Say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim?,1
With him my lord; for he hath done me wrong.,1
What is that wrong whereof you both complain?,1
Crossing the sea from England into France,1
Upbraided me about the rose I wear;,1
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,1
About a certain question in the law,1
With other vile and ignominious terms:,1
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,1
And that is my petition noble lord:,1
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,1
And he first took exceptions at this badge,1
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.,1
Your private grudge my Lord of York will out,1
Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick men,1
Such factious emulations shall arise!,1
Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace.,1
And then your highness shall command a peace.,1
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.,1
Nay let it rest where it began at first.,1
Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!,1
Presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed,1
To trouble and disturb the king and us?,1
To bear with their perverse objections;,1
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:,1
It grieves his highness: good my lords be friends.,1
Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour,1
And you my lords remember where we are,1
If they perceive dissension in our looks,1
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked,1
Beside what infamy will there arise,1
That for a toy a thing of no regard,1
Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!,1
My tender years and let us not forego,1
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.,1
Putting on a red rose,1
I more incline to Somerset than York:,1
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,1
But your discretions better can persuade,1
And therefore as we hither came in peace,1
Cousin of York we institute your grace,1
And good my Lord of Somerset unite,1
And like true subjects sons of your progenitors,1
Your angry choler on your enemies.,1
After some respite will return to Calais;,1
To be presented by your victories,1
Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK WARWICK EXETER and VERNON,1
Prettily methought did play the orator.,1
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.,1
I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm.,1
Other affairs must now be managed.,1
Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice;,1
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there,1
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.,1
This jarring discord of nobility,1
This factious bandying of their favourites,1
Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;,1
There comes the rain there begins confusion.,1
SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux.,1
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux trumpeter:,1
Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others aloft,1
Servant in arms to Harry King of England;,1
Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,1
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:,1
You tempt the fury of my three attendants,1
Who in a moment even with the earth,1
If you forsake the offer of their love.,1
Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!,1
On us thou canst not enter but by death;,1
And strong enough to issue out and fight:,1
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:,1
To wall thee from the liberty of flight;,1
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil,1
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament,1
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.,1
Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!,1
That I thy enemy due thee withal;,1
Finish the process of his sandy hour,1
Shall see thee wither'd bloody pale and dead.,1
Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum a warning bell,1
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.,1
He fables not; I hear the enemy:,1
O negligent and heedless discipline!,1
A little herd of England's timorous deer,1
If we be English deer be then in blood;,1
But rather moody-mad and desperate stags,1
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:,1
And they shall find dear deer of us my friends.,1
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!,1
SCENE III. Plains in Gascony.,1
Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,1
They are return'd my lord and give it out,1
To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,1
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,1
A plague upon that villain Somerset,1
Of horsemen that were levied for this siege!,1
And I am lowted by a traitor villain,1
God comfort him in this necessity!,1
Enter Sir William LUCY,1
Never so needful on the earth of France,1
Who now is girdled with a waist of iron,1
To Bourdeaux warlike duke! to Bourdeaux York!,1
O God that Somerset who in proud heart,1
So should we save a valiant gentleman,1
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,1
O send some succor to the distress'd lord!,1
We mourn France smiles; we lose they daily get;,1
Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;,1
I met in travel toward his warlike father!,1
And now they meet where both their lives are done.,1
To bid his young son welcome to his grave?,1
That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.,1
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.,1
Long all of Somerset and his delay.,1
Thus while the vulture of sedition,1
Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss,1
That ever living man of memory,1
Lives honours lands and all hurry to loss.,1
SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony.,1
It is too late; I cannot send them now:,1
Too rashly plotted: all our general force,1
Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot,1
By this unheedful desperate wild adventure:,1
That Talbot dead great York might bear the name.,1
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.,1
How now Sir William! whither were you sent?,1
Who ring'd about with bold adversity,1
To beat assailing death from his weak legions:,1
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,1
You his false hopes the trust of England's honour,1
Let not your private discord keep away,1
While he renowned noble gentleman,1
Orleans the Bastard Charles Burgundy,1
And Talbot perisheth by your default.,1
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;,1
Collected for this expedition.,1
I owe him little duty and less love;,1
The fraud of England not the force of France,1
Never to England shall he bear his life;,1
Come go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:,1
Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;,1
And fly would Talbot never though he might.,1
His fame lives in the world his shame in you.,1
SCENE V. The English camp near Bourdeaux.,1
O young John Talbot! I did send for thee,1
That Talbot's name might be in thee revived,1
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.,1
Now thou art come unto a feast of death,1
Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse;,1
By sudden flight: come dally not be gone.,1
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,1
To make a bastard and a slave of me!,1
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.,1
He that flies so will ne'er return again.,1
Then let me stay; and father do you fly:,1
My worth unknown no loss is known in me.,1
In yours they will in you all hopes are lost.,1
But mine it will that no exploit have done:,1
But if I bow they'll say it was for fear.,1
If the first hour I shrink and run away.,1
Rather than life preserved with infamy.,1
Ay rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.,1
To fight I will but not to fly the foe.,1
No part of him but will be shame in me.,1
Yes your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?,1
You cannot witness for me being slain.,1
And leave my followers here to fight and die?,1
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?,1
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:,1
For live I will not if my father die.,1
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.,1
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.,1
SCENE VI. A field of battle.,1
Saint George and victory! fight soldiers fight.,1
And left us to the rage of France his sword.,1
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.,1
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,1
To my determined time thou gavest new date.,1
It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire,1
Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,1
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.,1
From thee my boy and had the maidenhood,1
And interchanging blows I quickly shed,1
Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated base,1
Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine,1
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy,1
Art thou not weary John? how dost thou fare?,1
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?,1
The help of one stands me in little stead.,1
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!,1
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:,1
Tis but the shortening of my life one day:,1
My death's revenge thy youth and England's fame:,1
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.,1
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:,1
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,1
The coward horse that bears me fail and die!,1
To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!,1
An if I fly I am not Talbot's son:,1
If son to Talbot die at Talbot's foot.,1
Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:,1
And commendable proved let's die in pride.,1
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.,1
Where is my other life? mine own is gone;,1
Triumphant death smear'd with captivity,1
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,1
And like a hungry lion did commence,1
But when my angry guardant stood alone,1
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart,1
Into the clustering battle of the French;,1
His over-mounting spirit and there died,1
O my dear lord lo where your son is borne!,1
Thou antic death which laugh'st us here to scorn,1
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,1
In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.,1
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!,1
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.,1
Had death been French then death had died to-day.,1
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.,1
Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.,1
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BURGUNDY BASTARD OF ORLEANS JOAN LA PUCELLE and forces,1
We should have found a bloody day of this.,1
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!,1
Thou maiden youth be vanquish'd by a maid:',1
He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born,1
So rushing in the bowels of the French,1
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;,1
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!,1
Whose life was England's glory Gallia's wonder.,1
During the life let us not wrong it dead.,1
Herald conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,1
On what submissive message art thou sent?,1
We English warriors wot not what it means.,1
And to survey the bodies of the dead.,1
But tell me whom thou seek'st.,1
Valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury,1
Great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence;,1
Lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Verdun of Alton,1
The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;,1
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;,1
Of all his wars within the realm of France?,1
The Turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath,1
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles,1
Is Talbot slain the Frenchmen's only scourge,1
O were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,1
O that I could but call these dead to life!,1
Were but his picture left amongst you here,1
Give me their bodies that I may bear them hence,1
I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,1
For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,1
Go take their bodies hence.,1
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.,1
And now to Paris in this conquering vein:,1
Exeunt,1
SCENE I. London. The palace.,1
Have you perused the letters from the pope,1
I have my lord: and their intent is this:,1
To have a godly peace concluded of,1
How doth your grace affect their motion?,1
To stop effusion of our Christian blood,1
Ay marry uncle; for I always thought,1
That such immanity and bloody strife,1
Beside my lord the sooner to effect,1
The Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles,1
Proffers his only daughter to your grace,1
Marriage uncle! alas my years are young!,1
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.,1
So let them have their answers every one:,1
Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.,1
What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,1
Then I perceive that will be verified,1
If once he come to be a cardinal,1
My lords ambassadors your several suits,1
And therefore are we certainly resolved,1
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean,1
And for the proffer of my lord your master,1
As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,1
He doth intend she shall be England's queen.,1
Bear her this jewel pledge of my affection.,1
And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd,1
Exeunt all but CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER and Legate,1
Stay my lord legate: you shall first receive,1
Should be deliver'd to his holiness,1
I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.,1
[Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit I trow,1
Humphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive,1
The bishop will be overborne by thee:,1
Or sack this country with a mutiny.,1
SCENE II. France. Plains in Anjou.,1
These news my lord may cheer our drooping spirits:,1
And turn again unto the warlike French.,1
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.,1
Else ruin combat with their palaces!,1
Success unto our valiant general,1
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.,1
Into two parties is now conjoined in one,1
Somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is;,1
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:,1
Of all base passions fear is most accursed.,1
Let Henry fret and all the world repine.,1
Exeunt,1
Alarum. Excursions. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE,1
Now help ye charming spells and periapts;,1
And give me signs of future accidents.,1
You speedy helpers that are substitutes,1
Appear and aid me in this enterprise.,1
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof,1
Now ye familiar spirits that are cull'd,1
Help me this once that France may get the field.,1
O hold me not with silence over-long!,1
I'll lop a member off and give it you,1
So you do condescend to help me now.,1
No hope to have redress? My body shall,1
They shake their heads,1
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?,1
Before that England give the French the foil.,1
See they forsake me! Now the time is come,1
And let her head fall into England's lap.,1
And hell too strong for me to buckle with:,1
Exit,1
Damsel of France I think I have you fast:,1
And try if they can gain your liberty.,1
See how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,1
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.,1
No shape but his can please your dainty eye.,1
And may ye both be suddenly surprised,1
Fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue!,1
Curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake.,1
Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand,1
Gazes on her,1
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;,1
And lay them gently on thy tender side.,1
Margaret my name and daughter to a king,1
An earl I am and Suffolk am I call'd.,1
Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:,1
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.,1
Go and be free again as Suffolk's friend.,1
O stay! I have no power to let her pass;,1
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,1
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.,1
I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind.,1
Hast not a tongue? is she not here?,1
Ay beauty's princely majesty is such,1
Say Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--,1
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.,1
Before thou make a trial of her love?,1
She's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd;,1
Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea or no.,1
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?,1
There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.,1
And yet a dispensation may be had.,1
I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?,1
He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.,1
And peace established between these realms,1
For though her father be the King of Naples,1
And our nobility will scorn the match.,1
It shall be so disdain they ne'er so much.,1
Madam I have a secret to reveal.,1
And will not any way dishonour me.,1
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;,1
Sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause--,1
Lady wherefore talk you so?,1
Say gentle princess would you not suppose,1
To be a queen in bondage is more vile,1
For princes should be free.,1
If happy England's royal king be free.,1
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,1
And set a precious crown upon thy head,1
What?,1
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.,1
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,1
How say you madam are ye so content?,1
Then call our captains and our colours forth.,1
We'll crave a parley to confer with him.,1
See Reignier see thy daughter prisoner!,1
To me.,1
I am a soldier and unapt to weep,1
Yes there is remedy enough my lord:,1
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;,1
And this her easy-held imprisonment,1
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?,1
That Suffolk doth not flatter face or feign.,1
To give thee answer of thy just demand.,1
And here I will expect thy coming.,1
Welcome brave earl into our territories:,1
Thanks Reignier happy for so sweet a child,1
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?,1
To be the princely bride of such a lord;,1
Enjoy mine own the country Maine and Anjou,1
My daughter shall be Henry's if he please.,1
And those two counties I will undertake,1
And I again in Henry's royal name,1
Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.,1
Because this is in traffic of a king.,1
And yet methinks I could be well content,1
I'll over then to England with this news,1
So farewell Reignier: set this diamond safe,1
I do embrace thee as I would embrace,1
Farewell my lord: good wishes praise and prayers,1
Going,1
No princely commendations to my king?,1
A virgin and his servant say to him.,1
But madam I must trouble you again;,1
Yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart,1
And this withal.,1
That for thyself: I will not so presume,1
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET,1
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;,1
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:,1
And natural graces that extinguish art;,1
That when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,1
Exit,1
Enter YORK WARWICK and others,1
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE guarded and a Shepherd,1
Have I sought every country far and near,1
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?,1
Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!,1
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.,1
I did beget her all the parish knows:,1
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.,1
This argues what her kind of life hath been,1
Fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle!,1
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:,1
Peasant avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,1
Tis true I gave a noble to the priest,1
Kneel down and take my blessing good my girl.,1
Of thy nativity! I would the milk,1
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!,1
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!,1
O burn her burn her! hanging is too good.,1
Take her away; for she hath lived too long,1
First let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:,1
But issued from the progeny of kings;,1
By inspiration of celestial grace,1
I never had to do with wicked spirits:,1
Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,1
Because you want the grace that others have,1
To compass wonders but by help of devils.,1
A virgin from her tender infancy,1
Whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused,1
Ay ay: away with her to execution!,1
Spare for no faggots let there be enow:,1
That so her torture may be shortened.,1
Then Joan discover thine infirmity,1
I am with child ye bloody homicides:,1
Although ye hale me to a violent death.,1
The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:,1
She and the Dauphin have been juggling:,1
Well go to; we'll have no bastards live;,1
You are deceived; my child is none of his:,1
Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!,1
O give me leave I have deluded you:,1
But Reignier king of Naples that prevail'd.,1
Why here's a girl! I think she knows not well,1
It's sign she hath been liberal and free.,1
Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee:,1
Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:,1
Upon the country where you make abode;,1
Environ you till mischief and despair,1
Exit guarded,1
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!,1
CARDINAL,1
With letters of commission from the king.,1
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,1
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;,1
Approacheth to confer about some matter.,1
After the slaughter of so many peers,1
That in this quarrel have been overthrown,1
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?,1
By treason falsehood and by treachery,1
O Warwick Warwick! I foresee with grief,1
Be patient York: if we conclude a peace,1
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.,1
Since lords of England it is thus agreed,1
We come to be informed by yourselves,1
Speak Winchester; for boiling choler chokes,1
By sight of these our baleful enemies.,1
Charles and the rest it is enacted thus:,1
Of mere compassion and of lenity,1
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,1
And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear,1
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,1
Must he be then as shadow of himself?,1
And yet in substance and authority,1
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.,1
With more than half the Gallian territories,1
Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,1
As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?,1
That which I have than coveting for more,1
Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means,1
And now the matter grows to compromise,1
Either accept the title thou usurp'st,1
And not of any challenge of desert,1
My lord you do not well in obstinacy,1
If once it be neglected ten to one,1
To say the truth it is your policy,1
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen,1
And therefore take this compact of a truce,1
How say'st thou Charles? shall our condition stand?,1
Only reserved you claim no interest,1
Then swear allegiance to his majesty,1
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,1
So now dismiss your army when ye please:,1
For here we entertain a solemn peace.,1
SCENE V. London. The palace.,1
Your wondrous rare description noble earl,1
Her virtues graced with external gifts,1
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts,1
So am I driven by breath of her renown,1
Where I may have fruition of her love.,1
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;,1
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,1
Able to ravish any dull conceit:,1
So full-replete with choice of all delights,1
She is content to be at your command;,1
To love and honour Henry as her lord.,1
Therefore my lord protector give consent,1
So should I give consent to flatter sin.,1
Unto another lady of esteem:,1
And not deface your honour with reproach?,1
Or one that at a triumph having vow'd,1
By reason of his adversary's odds:,1
And therefore may be broke without offence.,1
Her father is no better than an earl,1
Yes lord her father is a king,1
And of such great authority in France,1
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.,1
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.,1
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.,1
That he should be so abject base and poor,1
Henry is able to enrich his queen,1
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,1
Marriage is a matter of more worth,1
Not whom we will but whom his grace affects,1
And therefore lords since he affects her most,1
In our opinions she should be preferr'd.,1
An age of discord and continual strife?,1
And is a pattern of celestial peace.,1
But Margaret that is daughter to a king?,1
Approves her fit for none but for a king:,1
More than in women commonly is seen,1
For Henry son unto a conqueror,1
If with a lady of so high resolve,1
Then yield my lords; and here conclude with me,1
Whether it be through force of your report,1
My tender youth was never yet attaint,1
I cannot tell; but this I am assured,1
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,1
Take therefore shipping; post my lord to France;,1
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come,1
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:,1
Among the people gather up a tenth.,1
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.,1
If you do censure me by what you were,1
This sudden execution of my will.,1
I may revolve and ruminate my grief.,1
Ay grief I fear me both at first and last.,1
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,1
With hope to find the like event in love,1
Margaret shall now be queen and rule the king;,1
Exit,1
SCENE I. London. The palace.,2
As by your high imperial majesty,2
As procurator to your excellence,2
So in the famous ancient city Tours,2
The Dukes of Orleans Calaber Bretagne and Alencon,2
I have perform'd my task and was espoused:,2
In sight of England and her lordly peers,2
To your most gracious hands that are the substance,2
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,2
Suffolk arise. Welcome Queen Margaret:,2
Than this kind kiss. O Lord that lends me life,2
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face,2
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.,2
The mutual conference that my mind hath had,2
In courtly company or at my beads,2
Makes me the bolder to salute my king,2
And over-joy of heart doth minister.,2
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,2
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.,2
[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret England's,2
We thank you all.,2
My lord protector so it please your grace,2
Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,2
[Reads]  'Imprimis it is agreed between the French,2
Suffolk ambassador for Henry King of England that,2
daughter unto Reignier King of Naples Sicilia and,2
thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item that the duchy,2
and delivered to the king her father'--,2
Uncle how now!,2
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart,2
Uncle of Winchester I pray read on.,2
that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be,2
and she sent over of the King of England's own,2
They please us well. Lord marquess kneel down:,2
And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,2
I' the parts of France till term of eighteen months,2
Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset,2
We thank you all for the great favour done,2
Come let us in and with all speed provide,2
Exeunt KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK,2
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,2
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,2
Did he so often lodge in open field,2
To conquer France his true inheritance?,2
To keep by policy what Henry got?,2
Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick,2
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,2
Studied so long sat in the council-house,2
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,2
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?,2
Shall Henry's conquest Bedford's vigilance,2
O peers of England shameful is this league!,2
Blotting your names from books of memory,2
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,2
Nephew what means this passionate discourse,2
For France 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.,2
But now it is impossible we should:,2
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine,2
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.,2
These counties were the keys of Normandy.,2
For grief that they are past recovery:,2
My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears.,2
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:,2
Delivered up again with peaceful words?,2
For Suffolk's duke may he be suffocate,2
France should have torn and rent my very heart,2
I never read but England's kings have had,2
And our King Henry gives away his own,2
A proper jest and never heard before,2
For costs and charges in transporting her!,2
in France Before--,2
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.,2
Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,2
Rancour will out: proud prelate in thy face,2
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.,2
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.,2
So there goes our protector in a rage.,2
Nay more an enemy unto you all,2
Consider lords he is the next of blood,2
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,2
There's reason he should be displeased at it.,2
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.,2
Calling him 'Humphrey the good Duke of,2
Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice,2
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!',2
He will be found a dangerous protector.,2
He being of age to govern of himself?,2
And all together with the Duke of Suffolk,2
This weighty business will not brook delay:,2
Exit,2
And greatness of his place be grief to us,2
His insolence is more intolerable,2
If Gloucester be displaced he'll be protector.,2
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.,2
Pride went before ambition follows him.,2
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.,2
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.,2
More like a soldier than a man o' the church,2
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself,2
Warwick my son the comfort of my age,2
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,2
And brother York thy acts in Ireland,2
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,2
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:,2
In what we can to bridle and suppress,2
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;,2
While they do tend the profit of the land.,2
And common profit of his country!,2
Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.,2
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,2
Main chance father you meant; but I meant Maine,2
Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY,2
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy,2
Suffolk concluded on the articles,2
To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.,2
Tis thine they give away and not their own.,2
And purchase friends and give to courtezans,2
While as the silly owner of the goods,2
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,2
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:,2
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.,2
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood,2
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.,2
Cold news for me for I had hope of France,2
A day will come when York shall claim his own;,2
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,2
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:,2
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,2
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.,2
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,2
Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love,2
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:,2
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;,2
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;,2
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.,2
SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.,2
Why droops my lord like over-ripen'd corn,2
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,2
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,2
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,2
If so gaze on and grovel on thy face,2
Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold.,2
And having both together heaved it up,2
And never more abase our sight so low,2
O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord,2
And may that thought when I imagine ill,2
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!,2
What dream'd my lord? tell me and I'll requite it,2
Methought this staff mine office-badge in court,2
But as I think it was by the cardinal;,2
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,2
This was my dream: what it doth bode God knows.,2
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove,2
But list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke:,2
In the cathedral church of Westminster,2
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me,2
Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright:,2
Art thou not second woman in the realm,2
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,2
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,2
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?,2
What what my lord! are you so choleric,2
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,2
Nay be not angry; I am pleased again.,2
My lord protector 'tis his highness' pleasure,2
Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.,2
Yes my good lord I'll follow presently.,2
Follow I must; I cannot go before,2
Were I a man a duke and next of blood,2
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;,2
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.,2
We are alone; here's none but thee and I.,2
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!,2
But by the grace of God and Hume's advice,2
What say'st thou man? hast thou as yet conferr'd,2
With Roger Bolingbroke the conjurer?,2
This they have promised to show your highness,2
That shall make answer to such questions,2
It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:,2
We'll see these things effected to the full.,2
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.,2
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;,2
Seal up your lips and give no words but mum:,2
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:,2
Yet have I gold flies from another coast;,2
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,2
They knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,2
And buz these conjurations in her brain.,2
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.,2
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.,2
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,2
Sort how it will I shall have gold for all.,2
SCENE III. The palace.,2
My masters let's stand close: my lord protector,2
our supplications in the quill.,2
Jesu bless him!,2
Here a' comes methinks and the queen with him.,2
Come back fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk and,2
How now fellow! would'st anything with me?,2
protector.,2
supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:,2
Mine is an't please your grace against John,2
house and lands and wife and all from me.,2
yours? What's here!,2
Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing the,2
Alas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.,2
Horner for saying that the Duke of York was rightful,2
What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was,2
That my master was? no forsooth: my master said,2
Who is there?,2
Take this fellow in and send for,2
more of your matter before the King.,2
And as for you that love to be protected,2
Begin your suits anew and sue to him.,2
Away base cullions! Suffolk let them go.,2
Exeunt,2
Is this the fashion in the court of England?,2
And this the royalty of Albion's king?,2
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?,2
And must be made a subject to a duke?,2
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love,2
I thought King Henry had resembled thee,2
But all his mind is bent to holiness,2
His champions are the prophets and apostles,2
His study is his tilt-yard and his loves,2
I would the college of the cardinals,2
And set the triple crown upon his head:,2
Madam be patient: as I was cause,2
In England work your grace's full content.,2
The imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham,2
But can do more in England than the king.,2
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:,2
Not all these lords do vex me half so much,2
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,2
Strangers in court do take her for the queen:,2
And in her heart she scorns our poverty:,2
Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,2
The very train of her worst wearing gown,2
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.,2
And placed a quire of such enticing birds,2
And never mount to trouble you again.,2
For I am bold to counsel you in this.,2
Yet must we join with him and with the lords,2
As for the Duke of York this late complaint,2
So one by one we'll weed them all at last,2
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER  CARDINAL BUCKINGHAM YORK SOMERSET SALISBURY WARWICK and the DUCHESS,2
Or Somerset or York all's one to me.,2
Then let him be denay'd the regentship.,2
Let York be regent; I will yield to him.,2
Dispute not that: York is the worthier.,2
The cardinal's not my better in the field.,2
Warwick may live to be the best of all.,2
Why Somerset should be preferred in this.,2
Madam the king is old enough himself,2
If he be old enough what needs your grace,2
Madam I am protector of the realm;,2
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.,2
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;,2
And all the peers and nobles of the realm,2
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags,2
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire,2
Thy cruelty in execution,2
And left thee to the mercy of the law.,2
If they were known as the suspect is great,2
Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan,2
She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear,2
Was't I! yea I it was proud Frenchwoman:,2
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.,2
Against her will! good king look to't in time;,2
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,2
Exit,2
And listen after Humphrey how he proceeds:,2
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.,2
Re-enter GLOUCESTER,2
With walking once about the quadrangle,2
As for your spiteful false objections,2
But God in mercy so deal with my soul,2
But to the matter that we have in hand:,2
To be your regent in the realm of France.,2
To show some reason of no little force,2
I'll tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet:,2
Next if I be appointed for the place,2
Without discharge money or furniture,2
Last time I danced attendance on his will,2
That can I witness; and a fouler fact,2
Peace headstrong Warwick!,2
Enter HORNER the Armourer and his man PETER guarded,2
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!,2
What mean'st thou Suffolk; tell me what are these?,2
That doth accuse his master of high treason:,2
Was rightful heir unto the English crown,2
Say man were these thy words?,2
thought any such matter: God is my witness I am,2
By these ten bones my lords he did speak them to,2
Lord of York's armour.,2
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.,2
Let him have all the rigor of the law.,2
My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct,2
knees he would be even with me: I have good,2
do not cast away an honest man for a villain's,2
Uncle what shall we say to this in law?,2
Let Somerset be regent over the French,2
And let these have a day appointed them,2
For he hath witness of his servant's malice:,2
I humbly thank your royal majesty.,2
Alas my lord I cannot fight; for God's sake pity,2
Lord have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to,2
Sirrah or you must fight or else be hang'd.,2
shall be the last of the next month. Come,2
Flourish. Exeunt,2
Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN HUME SOUTHWELL and BOLINGBROKE,2
performance of your promises.,2
ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?,2
I have heard her reported to be a woman of an,2
Master Hume that you be by her aloft while we be,2
and leave us.,2
Mother Jourdain be you,2
read you; and let us to our work.,2
Well said my masters; and welcome all. To this,2
Patience good lady; wizards know their times:,2
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;,2
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,2
Madam sit you and fear not: whom we raise,2
Here they do the ceremonies belonging and make the  circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads Conjuro te and c. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth,2
Asmath,2
Thou tremblest at answer that I shall ask;,2
Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!,2
Reading out of a paper,2
But him outlive and die a violent death.,2
What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?',2
What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?',2
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains,2
Have done for more I hardly can endure.,2
False fiend avoid!,2
Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard and break in,2
Beldam I think we watch'd you at an inch.,2
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:,2
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.,2
Injurious duke that threatest where's no cause.,2
Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.,2
Stafford take her to thee.,2
We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.,2
Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN SOUTHWELL  and c,2
A pretty plot well chosen to build upon!,2
What have we here?,2
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;,2
Why this is just,2
Well to the rest:,2
By water shall he die and take his end.,2
Let him shun castles;,2
Than where castles mounted stand.',2
These oracles are hardly attain'd,2
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,2
Thither go these news as fast as horse can,2
A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.,2
To be the post in hope of his reward.,2
there ho!,2
Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,2
Exeunt,2
SCENE I. Saint Alban's.,2
Believe me lords for flying at the brook,2
Yet by your leave the wind was very high;,2
But what a point my lord your falcon made,2
To see how God in all his creatures works!,2
No marvel an it like your majesty,2
They know their master loves to be aloft,2
My lord 'tis but a base ignoble mind,2
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.,2
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?,2
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts,2
Pernicious protector dangerous peer,2
What cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory?,2
Churchmen so hot? good uncle hide such malice;,2
No malice sir; no more than well becomes,2
As who my lord?,2
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.,2
And thy ambition Gloucester.,2
And whet not on these furious peers;,2
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,2
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith holy uncle would,2
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Marry when thou darest.,2
numbers for the matter;,2
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay where thou darest,2
This evening on the east side of the grove.,2
Believe me cousin Gloucester,2
We had had more sport.,2
Come with thy two-hand sword.,2
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the,2
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal I am with you.,2
Talking of hawking; nothing else my lord.,2
Now by God's mother priest I'll shave your crown for this,2
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice teipsum--,2
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs lords.,2
When such strings jar what hope of harmony?,2
Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's crying 'A miracle!',2
Fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim?,2
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.,2
Within this half-hour hath received his sight;,2
Now God be praised that to believing souls,2
Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren bearing SIMPCOX between two in a chair SIMPCOX's Wife following,2
To present your highness with the man.,2
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.,2
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.,2
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.,2
Born blind an't please your grace.,2
What woman is this?,2
Hadst thou been his mother thou couldst have,2
Where wert thou born?,2
Poor soul God's goodness hath been great to thee:,2
But still remember what the Lord hath done.,2
Or of devotion to this holy shrine?,2
A hundred times and oftener in my sleep,2
Come offer at my shrine and I will help thee.',2
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.,2
Ay God Almighty help me!,2
A fall off of a tree.,2
How long hast thou been blind?,2
What and wouldst climb a tree?,2
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.,2
venture so.,2
And made me climb with danger of my life.,2
Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:,2
Yes master clear as day I thank God and,2
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?,2
Why that's well said. What colour is my gown of?,2
Why then thou know'st what colour jet is of?,2
But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.,2
Tell me sirrah what's my name?,2
What's his name?,2
Nor his?,2
What's thine own name?,2
Then Saunder sit there the lyingest knave in,2
mightest as well have known all our names as thus to,2
distinguish of colours but suddenly to nominate them,2
hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his,2
to his legs again?,2
My masters of Saint Alban's have you not beadles in,2
Yes my lord if it please your grace.,2
Sirrah go fetch the beadle hither straight.,2
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now sirrah,2
over this stool and run away.,2
You go about to torture me in vain.,2
Well sir we must have you find your legs. Sirrah,2
I will my lord. Come on sirrah; off with your,2
Alas master what shall I do? I am not able to stand.,2
O God seest Thou this and bearest so long?,2
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.,2
Let them be whipped through every market-town till,2
Exeunt Wife Beadle Mayor  and c,2
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.,2
You made in a day my lord whole towns to fly.,2
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?,2
A sort of naughty persons lewdly bent,2
Of Lady Eleanor the protector's wife,2
Have practised dangerously against your state,2
Whom we have apprehended in the fact;,2
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,2
As more at large your grace shall understand.,2
by this means,2
This news I think hath turn'd your weapon's edge;,2
Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart:,2
And vanquish'd as I am I yield to thee,2
O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones,2
Gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest.,2
Madam for myself to heaven I do appeal,2
And for my wife I know not how it stands;,2
Noble she is but if she have forgot,2
As like to pitch defile nobility,2
And give her as a prey to law and shame,2
Well for this night we will repose us here:,2
To look into this business thoroughly,2
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,2
Flourish. Exeunt,2
Enter YORK SALISBURY and WARWICK,2
Our simple supper ended give me leave,2
In craving your opinion of my title,2
My lord I long to hear it at full.,2
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.,2
Edward the Third my lords had seven sons:,2
The second William of Hatfield and the third,2
Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster;,2
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester;,2
Edward the Black Prince died before his father,2
Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;,2
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,2
Seized on the realm deposed the rightful king,2
And him to Pomfret; where as all you know,2
Father the duke hath told the truth:,2
Which now they hold by force and not by right;,2
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.,2
The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line,2
Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March:,2
Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor.,2
As I have read laid claim unto the crown;,2
Who kept him in captivity till he died.,2
His eldest sister Anne,2
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son,2
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir,2
Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe,2
So if the issue of the elder son,2
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?,2
The fourth son; York claims it from the third.,2
It fails not yet but flourishes in thee,2
Then father Salisbury kneel we together;,2
That shall salute our rightful sovereign,2
Long live our sovereign Richard England's king!,2
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd,2
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,2
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:,2
At Beaufort's pride at Somerset's ambition,2
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,2
Tis that they seek and they in seeking that,2
My lord break we off; we know your mind at full.,2
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.,2
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick,2
Exeunt,2
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN  MARGARET GLOUCESTER YORK SUFFOLK and SALISBURY;  the DUCHESS MARGARET JOURDAIN SOUTHWELL HUME and BOLINGBROKE under guard,2
In sight of God and us your guilt is great:,2
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.,2
From thence unto the place of execution:,2
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.,2
Despoiled of your honour in your life,2
Live in your country here in banishment,2
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.,2
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.,2
Mine eyes are full of tears my heart of grief.,2
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!,2
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.,2
Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself,2
My stay my guide and lantern to my feet:,2
Than when thou wert protector to thy King.,2
Should be to be protected like a child.,2
Give up your staff sir and the king his realm.,2
As willingly do I the same resign,2
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it,2
Farewell good king: when I am dead and gone,2
Exit,2
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,2
His lady banish'd and a limb lopp'd off.,2
Where it best fits to be in Henry's hand.,2
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.,2
This is the day appointed for the combat;,2
The armourer and his man to enter the lists,2
Ay good my lord; for purposely therefore,2
O God's name see the lists and all things fit:,2
I never saw a fellow worse bested,2
The servant of this armourer my lords.,2
Here neighbour Horner I drink to you in a cup of,2
And here neighbour here's a cup of charneco.,2
drink and fear not your man.,2
a fig for Peter!,2
Second 'Prentice Be merry Peter and fear not thy master: fight,2
I thank you all: drink and pray for me I pray,2
this world. Here Robin an if I die I give thee,2
and here Tom take all the money that I have. O,2
deal with my master he hath learnt me so much fence already.,2
Sirrah what's thy name?,2
Peter! what more?,2
Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.,2
instigation to prove him a knave and myself an,2
take my death I never meant him any ill nor the,2
thee with a downright blow!,2
Sound trumpets alarum to the combatants!,2
Hold Peter hold! I confess I confess treason.,2
Take away his weapon. Fellow thank God and the,2
O God have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?,2
Go take hence that traitor from our sight;,2
And God in justice hath revealed to us,2
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.,2
Sound a flourish. Exeunt,2
Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen in mourning cloaks,2
And after summer evermore succeeds,2
So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet.,2
Ten my lord.,2
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:,2
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.,2
The abject people gazing on thy face,2
That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels,2
But soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare,2
Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet and a taper  burning in her hand; with STANLEY the Sheriff and Officers,2
No stir not for your lives; let her pass by.,2
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!,2
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee!,2
And in thy closet pent up rue my shame,2
Be patient gentle Nell; forget this grief.,2
For whilst I think I am thy married wife,2
Methinks I should not thus be led along,2
And followed with a rabble that rejoice,2
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,2
And bid me be advised how I tread.,2
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,2
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;,2
Sometime I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife,2
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was,2
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock,2
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,2
Hang over thee as sure it shortly will;,2
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,2
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,2
But fear not thou until thy foot be snared,2
Ah Nell forbear! thou aimest all awry;,2
And had I twenty times so many foes,2
All these could not procure me any scathe,2
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?,2
But I in danger for the breach of law.,2
I pray thee sort thy heart to patience;,2
Enter a Herald,2
Holden at Bury the first of this next month.,2
This is close dealing. Well I will be there.,2
My Nell I take my leave: and master sheriff,2
An't please your grace here my commission stays,2
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.,2
So am I given in charge may't please your grace.,2
You use her well: the world may laugh again;,2
You do it her: and so Sir John farewell!,2
Witness my tears I cannot stay to speak.,2
Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!,2
Death at whose name I oft have been afear'd,2
Stanley I prithee go and take me hence;,2
Only convey me where thou art commanded.,2
There to be used according to your state.,2
And shall I then be used reproachfully?,2
According to that state you shall be used.,2
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.,2
Ay ay farewell; thy office is discharged.,2
Madam your penance done throw off this sheet,2
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:,2
And show itself attire me how I can.,2
Exeunt,2
SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.,2
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:,2
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.,2
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?,2
How insolent of late he is become,2
We know the time since he was mild and affable,2
Immediately he was upon his knee,2
But meet him now and be it in the morn,2
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,2
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.,2
But great men tremble when the lion roars;,2
First note that he is near you in descent,2
Me seemeth then it is no policy,2
And his advantage following your decease,2
Or be admitted to your highness' council.,2
And when he please to make commotion,2
Now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallow-rooted;,2
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.,2
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.,2
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,2
My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York,2
Or else conclude my words effectual.,2
And had I first been put to speak my mind,2
The duchess by his subornation,2
Or if he were not privy to those faults,2
As next the king he was successive heir,2
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess,2
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;,2
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.,2
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.,2
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?,2
Levy great sums of money through the realm,2
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.,2
Which time will bring to light in smooth,2
My lords at once: the care you have of us,2
Is worthy praise: but shall I speak my conscience,2
From meaning treason to our royal person,2
The duke is virtuous mild and too well given,2
Ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!,2
For he's disposed as the hateful raven:,2
For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.,2
Take heed my lord; the welfare of us all,2
Enter SOMERSET,2
Welcome Lord Somerset. What news from France?,2
Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.,2
[Aside]  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France,2
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,2
But I will remedy this gear ere long,2
Enter GLOUCESTER,2
Pardon my liege that I have stay'd so long.,2
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:,2
Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush,2
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.,2
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:,2
Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France,2
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.,2
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,2
So help me God as I have watch'd the night,2
That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,2
Be brought against me at my trial-day!,2
Because I would not tax the needy commons,2
And never ask'd for restitution.,2
I say no more than truth so help me God!,2
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,2
Why 'tis well known that whiles I was,2
Pity was all the fault that was in me;,2
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.,2
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,2
Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured,2
My lord these faults are easy quickly answered:,2
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.,2
And here commit you to my lord cardinal,2
My lord of Gloucester 'tis my special hope,2
My conscience tells me you are innocent.,2
Virtue is choked with foul ambition,2
Foul subornation is predominant,2
I know their complot is to have my life,2
And prove the period of their tyranny,2
But mine is made the prologue to their play;,2
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.,2
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;,2
The envious load that lies upon his heart;,2
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,2
And you my sovereign lady with the rest,2
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up,2
Ay all you have laid your heads together--,2
And all to make away my guiltless life.,2
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;,2
A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.',2
If those that care to keep your royal person,2
Be thus upbraided chid and rated at,2
Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.,2
With ignominious words though clerkly couch'd,2
False allegations to o'erthrow his state?,2
Far truer spoke than meant: I lose indeed;,2
And well such losers may have leave to speak.,2
Lord cardinal he is your prisoner.,2
Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch,2
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,2
Ah that my fear were false! ah that it were!,2
Exit guarded,2
Do or undo as if ourself were here.,2
Ay Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,2
My body round engirt with misery,2
Ah uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see,2
And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come,2
What louring star now envies thy estate,2
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?,2
And as the butcher takes away the calf,2
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,2
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,2
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,2
With sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes,2
So mighty are his vowed enemies.,2
Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.',2
Free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.,2
Too full of foolish pity and Gloucester's show,2
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,2
With shining chequer'd slough doth sting a child,2
Believe me lords were none more wise than I--,2
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,2
That he should die is worthy policy;,2
Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.,2
The king will labour still to save his life,2
And yet we have but trivial argument,2
So that by this you would not have him die.,2
Tis York that hath more reason for his death.,2
Say as you think and speak it from your souls,2
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,2
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.,2
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?,2
His guilt should be but idly posted over,2
No; let him die in that he is a fox,2
Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,2
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:,2
Sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how,2
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.,2
Not resolute except so much were done;,2
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,2
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,2
But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk,2
Say you consent and censure well the deed,2
I tender so the safety of my liege.,2
And so say I.,2
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.,2
Great lords from Ireland am I come amain,2
And put the Englishmen unto the sword:,2
Before the wound do grow uncurable;,2
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!,2
That Somerset be sent as regent thither:,2
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.,2
Had been the regent there instead of me,2
No not to lose it all as thou hast done:,2
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home,2
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:,2
Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire,2
No more good York; sweet Somerset be still:,2
Might happily have proved far worse than his.,2
And in the number thee that wishest shame!,2
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms,2
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,2
And try your hap against the Irishmen?,2
Why our authority is his consent,2
Then noble York take thou this task in hand.,2
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.,2
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.,2
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.,2
Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event.,2
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;,2
I'll see it truly done my Lord of York.,2
Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts,2
Be that thou hopest to be or what thou art,2
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,2
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought,2
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.,2
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.,2
To send me packing with an host of men:,2
Who cherish'd in your breasts will sting,2
Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:,2
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.,2
I will stir up in England some black storm,2
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage,2
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,2
And for a minister of my intent,2
John Cade of Ashford,2
Under the title of John Mortimer.,2
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,2
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;,2
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,2
Full often like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,2
And undiscover'd come to me again,2
This devil here shall be my substitute;,2
In face in gait in speech he doth resemble:,2
How they affect the house and claim of York.,2
I know no pain they can inflict upon him,2
Say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will,2
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;,2
And Henry put apart the next for me.,2
SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.,2
Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know,2
O that it were to do! What have we done?,2
Enter SUFFOLK,2
Now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing?,2
Why that's well said. Go get you to my house;,2
The king and all the peers are here at hand.,2
According as I gave directions?,2
Away! be gone.,2
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SOMERSET with Attendants,2
Say we intend to try his grace to-day.,2
I'll call him presently my noble lord.,2
Lords take your places; and I pray you all,2
Than from true evidence of good esteem,2
God forbid any malice should prevail,2
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!,2
Re-enter SUFFOLK,2
Where is our uncle? what's the matter Suffolk?,2
Marry God forfend!,2
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.,2
How fares my lord? Help lords! the king is dead.,2
Run go help help! O Henry ope thine eyes!,2
O heavenly God!,2
Comfort my sovereign! gracious Henry comfort!,2
Came he right now to sing a raven's note,2
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,2
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?,2
Lay not thy hands on me; forbear I say;,2
Thou baleful messenger out of my sight!,2
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.,2
Yet do not go away: come basilisk,2
For in the shade of death I shall find joy;,2
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?,2
Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:,2
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans,2
I would be blind with weeping sick with groans,2
And all to have the noble duke alive.,2
For it is known we were but hollow friends:,2
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,2
This get I by his death: ay me unhappy!,2
Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man!,2
What dost thou turn away and hide thy face?,2
What! art thou like the adder waxen deaf?,2
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?,2
Erect his statue and worship it,2
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,2
Drove back again unto my native clime?,2
Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,2
What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts,2
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,2
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,2
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,2
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness:,2
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,2
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.,2
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,2
And when the dusky sky began to rob,2
I took a costly jewel from my neck,2
And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,2
And even with this I lost fair England's view,2
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,2
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,2
To sit and witch me as Ascanius did,2
His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!,2
Ay me I can no more! die Margaret!,2
Noise within. Enter WARWICK SALISBURY and many Commons,2
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd,2
The commons like an angry hive of bees,2
And care not who they sting in his revenge.,2
Until they hear the order of his death.,2
But how he died God knows not Henry:,2
And comment then upon his sudden death.,2
With the rude multitude till I return.,2
O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts,2
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!,2
For judgment only doth belong to thee.,2
With twenty thousand kisses and to drain,2
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,2
But all in vain are these mean obsequies;,2
What were it but to make my sorrow greater?,2
Come hither gracious sovereign view this body.,2
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,2
As surely as my soul intends to live,2
To free us from his father's wrathful curse,2
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.,2
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?,2
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,2
Being all descended to the labouring heart;,2
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;,2
To blush and beautify the cheek again.,2
His eye-balls further out than when he lived,2
His hair uprear'd his nostrils stretched with struggling;,2
And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:,2
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,2
It cannot be but he was murder'd here;,2
Why Warwick who should do the duke to death?,2
And we I hope sir are no murderers.,2
And you forsooth had the good duke to keep:,2
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.,2
As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.,2
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,2
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,2
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?,2
Are you the butcher Suffolk? Where's your knife?,2
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;,2
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart,2
Say if thou darest proud Lord of Warwick-shire,2
Exeunt CARDINAL SOMERSET and others,2
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,2
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.,2
For every word you speak in his behalf,2
Blunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanor!,2
Thy mother took into her blameful bed,2
Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,2
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,2
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,2
I would false murderous coward on thy knee,2
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st,2
And after all this fearful homage done,2
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!,2
If from this presence thou darest go with me.,2
Unworthy though thou art I'll cope with thee,2
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK,2
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,2
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.,2
What noise is this?,2
Why how now lords! your wrathful weapons drawn,2
Why what tumultuous clamour have we here?,2
Set all upon me mighty sovereign.,2
the king shall know your mind.,2
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,2
They will by violence tear him from your palace,2
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;,2
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,2
As being thought to contradict your liking,2
They say in care of your most royal person,2
And charge that no man should disturb your rest,2
Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict,2
That slily glided towards your majesty,2
Lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,2
And therefore do they cry though you forbid,2
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,2
Your loving uncle twenty times his worth,2
[Within]  An answer from the king my,2
Tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds,2
But you my lord were glad to be employ'd,2
But all the honour Salisbury hath won,2
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.,2
Go Salisbury and tell them all from me.,2
And had I not been cited so by them,2
For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy,2
And therefore by His majesty I swear,2
He shall not breathe infection in this air,2
Exit SALISBURY,2
Ungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk!,2
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.,2
But when I swear it is irrevocable.,2
On any ground that I am ruler of,2
Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me;,2
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK,2
Heart's discontent and sour affliction,2
There's two of you; the devil make a third!,2
Cease gentle queen these execrations,2
Fie coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!,2
A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?,2
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,2
Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,2
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:,2
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;,2
Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban:,2
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!,2
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!,2
Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!,2
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!,2
Enough sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;,2
Or like an overcharged gun recoil,2
You bade me ban and will you bid me leave?,2
Well could I curse away a winter's night,2
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,2
O let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,2
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,2
O could this kiss be printed in thy hand,2
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!,2
Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,2
I will repeal thee or be well assured,2
And banished I am if but from thee.,2
O go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd,2
Loather a hundred times to part than die.,2
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;,2
Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence;,2
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:,2
With every several pleasure in the world,2
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;,2
Enter VAUX,2
To signify unto his majesty,2
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,2
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.,2
Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,2
The secrets of his overcharged soul;,2
That even now he cries aloud for him.,2
Exit VAUX,2
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,2
Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee,2
Theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows?,2
If thou be found by me thou art but dead.,2
And in thy sight to die what were it else,2
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,2
Dying with mother's dug between its lips:,2
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,2
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,2
And then it lived in sweet Elysium.,2
From thee to die were torture more than death:,2
Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,2
To France sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;,2
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.,2
And take my heart with thee.,2
That ever did contain a thing of worth.,2
This way fall I to death.,2
Exeunt severally,2
Enter the KING SALISBURY WARWICK to the CARDINAL in bed,2
thy sovereign.,2
Enough to purchase such another island,2
Ah what a sign it is of evil life,2
Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.,2
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?,2
O torture me no more! I will confess.,2
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.,2
Comb down his hair; look look! it stands upright,2
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary,2
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.,2
O beat away the busy meddling fiend,2
And from his bosom purge this black despair!,2
Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.,2
Lord cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,2
He dies and makes no sign. O God forgive him!,2
Forbear to judge for we are sinners all.,2
And let us all to meditation.,2
ACT IV,2
Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a  Captain a Master a Master's-mate WALTER WHITMORE and others; with them SUFFOLK and others prisoners,2
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;,2
That drag the tragic melancholy night;,2
Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws,2
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;,2
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,2
Master this prisoner freely give I thee;,2
The other Walter Whitmore is thy share.,2
A thousand crowns or else lay down your head.,2
What think you much to pay two thousand crowns,2
Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:,2
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!,2
And so will I and write home for it straight.,2
And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die;,2
And so should these if I might have my will.,2
Look on my George; I am a gentleman:,2
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.,2
death affright?,2
A cunning man did calculate my birth,2
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;,2
Gaultier or Walter which it is I care not:,2
But with our sword we wiped away the blot;,2
Broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced,2
Stay Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,2
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!,2
Jove sometimes went disguised and why not I?,2
Obscure and lowly swain King Henry's blood,2
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.,2
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule,2
How often hast thou waited at my cup,2
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?,2
Ay and allay this thy abortive pride;,2
And duly waited for my coming forth?,2
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.,2
First let my words stab him as he hath me.,2
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side,2
Thou darest not for thy own.,2
Pole!,2
Ay kennel puddle sink; whose filth and dirt,2
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth,2
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;,2
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,2
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,2
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,2
By devilish policy art thou grown great,2
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.,2
The false revolting Normans thorough thee,2
Hath slain their governors surprised our forts,2
The princely Warwick and the Nevils all,2
As hating thee are rising up in arms:,2
By shameful murder of a guiltless king,2
Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours,2
Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.',2
And to conclude reproach and beggary,2
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.,2
Upon these paltry servile abject drudges!,2
Being captain of a pinnace threatens more,2
Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:,2
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.,2
I go of message from the queen to France;,2
Walter--,2
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.,2
What are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?,2
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,2
Far be it we should honour such as these,2
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any,2
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole,2
True nobility is exempt from fear:,2
Hale him away and let him talk no more.,2
That this my death may never be forgot!,2
A Roman sworder and banditto slave,2
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders,2
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk,2
It is our pleasure one of them depart;,2
Exeunt all but the First Gentleman,2
There let his head and lifeless body lie,2
Exit,2
His body will I bear unto the king:,2
So will the queen that living held him dear.,2
SCENE II. Blackheath.,2
Come and get thee a sword though made of a lath;,2
They have the more need to sleep now then.,2
the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon it.,2
was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.,2
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.,2
True; and yet it is said labour in thy vocation;,2
labouring men; and therefore should we be,2
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a,2
I see them! I see them! there's Best's son the,2
He shall have the skin of our enemies to make,2
And Dick the Butcher--,2
throat cut like a calf.,2
Argo their thread of life is spun.,2
Drum. Enter CADE DICK the Butcher SMITH the Weaver and a Sawyer with infinite numbers,2
[Aside]  Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings.,2
the spirit of putting down kings and princes,2
Silence!,2
[Aside]  He was an honest man and a good,2
My mother a Plantagenet--,2
My wife descended of the Lacies--,2
sold many laces.,2
furred pack she washes bucks here at home.,2
[Aside]  Ay by my faith the field is honourable;,2
father had never a house but the cage.,2
[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.,2
[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him,2
I fear neither sword nor fire.,2
[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of,2
Be brave then; for your captain is brave and vows,2
halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped,2
to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in,2
grass: and when I am king as king I will be--,2
I thank you good people: there shall be no money;,2
apparel them all in one livery that they may agree,2
The first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers.,2
thing that of the skin of an innocent lamb should,2
o'er should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:,2
once to a thing and I was never mine own man,2
Enter some bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham,2
cast accompt.,2
We took him setting of boys' copies.,2
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.,2
Nay he can make obligations and write court-hand.,2

Emmanuel.,2
go hard with you.,2
hast thou a mark to thyself like an honest,2
Sir I thank God I have been so well brought up,2
He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain,2
Away with him I say! hang him with his pen and,2
Exit one with the Clerk,2
Where's our general?,2
Fly fly fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his,2
Stand villain stand or I'll fell thee down. He,2
he is but a knight is a'?,2
To equal him I will make myself a knight presently.,2
Rise up Sir John Mortimer.,2
Now have at him!,2
Rebellious hinds the filth and scum of Kent,2
Home to your cottages forsake this groom:,2
But angry wrathful and inclined to blood,2
As for these silken-coated slaves I pass not:,2
Over whom in time to come I hope to reign;,2
Villain thy father was a plasterer;,2
And Adam was a gardener.,2
Marry this: Edmund Mortimer Earl of March.,2
Ay sir.,2
That's false.,2
The elder of them being put to nurse,2
And ignorant of his birth and parentage,2
His son am I; deny it if you can.,2
Sir he made a chimney in my father's house and,2
therefore deny it not.,2
That speaks he knows not what?,2
Jack Cade the Duke of York hath taught you this.,2
Go to sirrah tell the king from me that for his,2
went to span-counter for French crowns I am content,2
And furthermore well have the Lord Say's head for,2
And good reason; for thereby is England mained and,2
it up. Fellow kings I tell you that that Lord Say,2
and more than that he can speak French; and,2
O gross and miserable ignorance!,2
enemies; go to then I ask but this: can he that,2
counsellor or no?,2
Well seeing gentle words will not prevail,2
Herald away; and throughout every town,2
That those which fly before the battle ends,2
Be hang'd up for example at their doors:,2
Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY and soldiers,2
Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.,2
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;,2
As would but that they dare not take our parts.,2
But then are we in order when we are most,2
Exeunt,2
Alarums to the fight wherein SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are slain. Enter CADE and the rest,2
Here sir.,2
behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own,2
the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou,2
one.,2
And to speak truth thou deservest no less. This,2
Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine,2
till I do come to London where we will have the,2
If we mean to thrive and do good break open the,2
Fear not that I warrant thee. Come let's march,2
Exeunt,2
Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY,2
And makes it fearful and degenerate;,2
But who can cease to weep and look on this?,2
But where's the body that I should embrace?,2
supplication?,2
For God forbid so many simple souls,2
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,2
But stay I'll read it over once again.,2
Ruled like a wandering planet over me,2
That were unworthy to behold the same?,2
Ay but I hope your highness shall have his.,2
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?,2
Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.,2
Enter a Messenger,2
The rebels are in Southwark; fly my lord!,2
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,2
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.,2
Of hinds and peasants rude and merciless:,2
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:,2
They call false caterpillars and intend their death.,2
My gracious lord return to Killingworth,2
Ah were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,2
Lord Say the traitors hate thee;,2
So might your grace's person be in danger.,2
And therefore in this city will I stay,2
Enter another Messenger,2
The citizens fly and forsake their houses:,2
Join with the traitor and they jointly swear,2
Then linger not my lord away take horse.,2
My hope is gone now Suffolk is deceased.,2
Trust nobody for fear you be betray'd.,2
And therefore am I bold and resolute.,2
SCENE V. London. The Tower.,2
How now! is Jack Cade slain?,2
won the bridge killing all those that withstand,2
the Tower to defend the city from the rebels.,2
But I am troubled here with them myself;,2
But get you to Smithfield and gather head,2
Fight for your king your country and your lives;,2
Exeunt,2
Enter CADE and the rest and strikes his staff on London-stone,2
upon London-stone I charge and command that of the,2
claret wine this first year of our reign. And now,2

They kill him,2
Cade more: I think he hath a very fair warning.,2

Exeunt,2
Alarums. MATTHEW GOFFE is slain and all the rest. Then enter CADE with his company.,2
others to the inns of court; down with them all.,2
Be it a lordship thou shalt have it for that word.,2

And henceforward all things shall be in common.,2
My lord a prize a prize! here's the Lord Say,2
one and twenty fifteens and one shilling to the,2
Enter BEVIS with Lord SAY,2

regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for,2
dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these,2

corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a,2
had no other books but the score and the tally thou,2
the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a,2
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and,2
ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed,2
about matters they were not able to answer.,2
they could not read thou hast hanged them; when,2
worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth dost thou not?,2
Marry thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a,2
and doublets.,2
that am a butcher.,2
What say you of Kent?,2
Away with him away with him! he speaks Latin.,2
Kent in the Commentaries Caesar writ,2
Sweet is the country because full of riches;,2
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.,2
Yet to recover them would lose my life.,2
Prayers and tears have moved me gifts could never.,2
But to maintain the king the realm and you?,2
Because my book preferr'd me to the king,2
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,2
You cannot but forbear to murder me:,2
For your behoof--,2
Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck,2
O monstrous coward! what to come behind folks?,2
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.,2
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.,2
Why dost thou quiver man?,2
Nay he nods at us as who should say I'll be even,2
on a pole or no. Take him away and behead him.,2
Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.,2
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?,2
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,2
O let me live!,2
but I'll bridle it: he shall die an it be but for,2
has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o',2
off his head presently; and then break into his,2
his head and bring them both upon two poles hither.,2
Ah countrymen! if when you make your prayers,2
How would it fare with your departed souls?,2
Away with him! and do as I command ye.,2
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head,2
shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me,2
me in capite; and we charge and command that their,2
My lord when shall we go to Cheapside and take up,2
Marry presently.,2
Re-enter one with the heads,2
for they loved well when they were alive. Now part,2
some more towns in France. Soldiers defer the,2

Exeunt,2
Alarum and retreat. Enter CADE and all his rabblement,2
and knock down! throw them into Thames!,2
What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to,2
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD attended,2
Know Cade we come ambassadors from the king,2
And here pronounce free pardon to them all,2
What say ye countrymen? will ye relent,2
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?,2
Fling up his cap and say 'God save his majesty!',2
Henry the Fifth that made all France to quake,2
God save the king! God save the king!,2
you base peasants do ye believe him? will you,2
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,2
Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out,2
freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,2
them break your backs with burthens take your,2
daughters before your faces: for me I will make,2
all!,2
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,2
Will he conduct you through the heart of France,2
Alas he hath no home no place to fly to;,2
Unless by robbing of your friends and us.,2
The fearful French whom you late vanquished,2
Methinks already in this civil broil,2
Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.,2
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.,2
Spare England for it is your native coast;,2
God on our side doubt not of victory.,2
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this,2
to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me,2
surprise me. My sword make way for me for here is,2
through the very middest of you? and heavens and,2
but only my followers' base and ignominious,2
Exit,2
And he that brings his head unto the king,2
Exeunt some of them,2
To reconcile you all unto the king.,2
SCENE IX. Kenilworth Castle.,2
Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,2
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle,2
Was never subject long'd to be a king,2
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD,2
Why Buckingham is the traitor Cade surprised?,2
Enter below multitudes with halters about their necks,2
And humbly thus with halters on their necks,2
Then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates,2
Soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives,2
Continue still in this so good a mind,2
Assure yourselves will never be unkind:,2
I do dismiss you to your several countries.,2
Enter a Messenger,2
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,2
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns,2
And still proclaimeth as he comes along,2
The Duke of Somerset whom he terms traitor.,2
Like to a ship that having 'scaped a tempest,2
But now is Cade driven back his men dispersed;,2
I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him,2
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;,2
Until his army be dismiss'd from him.,2
I'll yield myself to prison willingly,2
In any case be not too rough in terms;,2
I will my lord; and doubt not so to deal,2
Come wife let's in and learn to govern better;,2
Flourish. Exeunt,2
Enter CADE,2
and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I,2
all the country is laid for me; but now am I so,2
thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,2
see if I can eat grass or pick a sallet another,2
this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet',2
sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown,2
bravely marching it hath served me instead of a,2
must serve me to feed on.,2
Lord who would live turmoiled in the court,2
This small inheritance my father left me,2
I seek not to wax great by others' waning,2
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state,2
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a,2
Ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand,2
I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow,2
Why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be,2
Is't not enough to break into my garden,2
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,2
Brave thee! ay by the best blood that ever was,2
have eat no meat these five days; yet come thou and,2
as a doornail I pray God I may never eat grass more.,2
That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent,2
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,2
Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser;,2
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;,2
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,2
As for words whose greatness answers words,2
By my valour the most complete champion that ever I,2
the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou,2
mayst be turned to hobnails.,2
O I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:,2
but the ten meals I have lost and I'll defy them,2
burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,2
Is't Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor?,2
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:,2
But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,2
Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory. Tell,2
all the world to be cowards; for I that never,2
Dies,2
Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee;,2
So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell.,2
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,2
Which I will bear in triumph to the king,2
Exit,2
SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.,2
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,2
Ring bells aloud; burn bonfires clear and bright,2
Ah! sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear?,2
This hand was made to handle naught but gold.,2
Except a sword or sceptre balance it:,2
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.,2
Whom have we here? Buckingham to disturb me?,2
York if thou meanest well I greet thee well.,2
Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure?,2
To know the reason of these arms in peace;,2
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,2
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.,2
O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,2
And now like Ajax Telamonius,2
I am far better born than is the king,2
But I must make fair weather yet a while,2
Buckingham I prithee pardon me,2
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.,2
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,2
That is too much presumption on thy part:,2
The king hath yielded unto thy demand:,2
Upon thine honour is he prisoner?,2
Then Buckingham I do dismiss my powers.,2
Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,2
And let my sovereign virtuous Henry,2
As pledges of my fealty and love;,2
Lands goods horse armour any thing I have,2
York I commend this kind submission:,2
Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants,2
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?,2
York doth present himself unto your highness.,2
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,2
Who since I heard to be discomfited.,2
If one so rude and of so mean condition,2
Lo I present your grace a traitor's head,2
The head of Cade! Great God how just art Thou!,2
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.,2
I was an't like your majesty.,2
Alexander Iden that's my name;,2
So please it you my lord 'twere not amiss,2
Iden kneel down.,2
Rise up a knight.,2
And will that thou henceforth attend on us.,2
And never live but true unto his liege!,2
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET,2
Go bid her hide him quickly from the duke.,2
But boldly stand and front him to his face.,2
Then York unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,2
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?,2
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?,2
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,2
That head of thine doth not become a crown;,2
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.,2
Whose smile and frown like to Achilles' spear,2
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,2
Give place: by heaven thou shalt rule no more,2
O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee York,2
Obey audacious traitor; kneel for grace.,2
If they can brook I bow a knee to man.,2
Exit Attendant,2
They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.,2
To say if that the bastard boys of York,2
Exit BUCKINGHAM,2
Outcast of Naples England's bloody scourge!,2
Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those,2
Enter EDWARD and RICHARD,2
make it good.,2
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.,2
Kneels,2
Nay do not fright us with an angry look;,2
For thy mistaking so we pardon thee.,2
But thou mistakest me much to think I do:,2
Ay Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour,2
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,2
He is arrested but will not obey;,2
Will you not sons?,2
And if words will not then our weapons shall.,2
Look in a glass and call thy image so:,2
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,2
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:,2
Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY,2
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,2
Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur,2
Who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,2
And such a piece of service will you do,2
Hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump,2
Nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon.,2
Why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow?,2
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!,2
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?,2
If it be banish'd from the frosty head,2
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,2
Why art thou old and want'st experience?,2
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me,2
My lord I have consider'd with myself,2
And in my conscience do repute his grace,2
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?,2
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?,2
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.,2
To do a murderous deed to rob a man,2
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,2
And have no other reason for this wrong,2
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.,2
Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast,2
The first I warrant thee if dreams prove true.,2
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.,2
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;,2
Might I but know thee by thy household badge.,2
The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,2
As on a mountain top the cedar shows,2
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.,2
And tread it under foot with all contempt,2
And so to arms victorious father,2
Fie! charity for shame! speak not in spite,2
Foul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tell.,2
Exeunt severally,2
Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK,2
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,2
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,2
Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland,2
Enter YORK,2
The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,2
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows,2
Enter CLIFFORD,2
Hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase,2
Then nobly York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.,2
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.,2
What seest thou in me York? why dost thou pause?,2
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.,2
But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.,2
As I in justice and true right express it.,2
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.,2
La fin couronne les oeuvres.,2
Thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still.,2
Exit,2
Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;,2
Where it should guard. O war thou son of hell,2
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part,2
He that is truly dedicate to war,2
Hath not essentially but by circumstance,2
Seeing his dead father,2
And the premised flames of the last day,2
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,2
To cease! Wast thou ordain'd dear father,2
The silver livery of advised age,2
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight,2
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;,2
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,2
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.,2
Meet I an infant of the house of York,2
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:,2
Come thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:,2
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;,2
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.,2
Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed,2
For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,2
Hath made the wizard famous in his death.,2
Priests pray for enemies but princes kill.,2
Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET and others,2
Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret stay.,2
Now is it manhood wisdom and defence,2
By what we can which can no more but fly.,2
If you be ta'en we then should see the bottom,2
As well we may if not through your neglect,2
And where this breach now in our fortunes made,2
Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD,2
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:,2
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.,2
To see their day and them our fortune give:,2
Exeunt,2
Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK RICHARD WARWICK and Soldiers with drum and colours,2
That winter lion who in rage forgets,2
And like a gallant in the brow of youth,2
Is not itself nor have we won one foot,2
My noble father,2
Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,2
But still where danger was still there I met him;,2
So was his will in his old feeble body.,2
Enter SALISBURY,2
By the mass so did we all. I thank you Richard:,2
And it hath pleased him that three times to-day,2
Well lords we have not got that which we have:,2
Being opposites of such repairing nature.,2
For as I hear the king is fled to London,2
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.,2
After them! nay before them if we can.,2
Saint Alban's battle won by famous York,2
Sound drums and trumpets and to London all:,2
Exeunt,2
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.,3
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.,3
He slily stole away and left his men:,3
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,3
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast,3
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.,3
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;,3
That this is true father behold his blood.,3
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.,3
Throwing down SOMERSET's head,3
But is your grace dead my Lord of Somerset?,3
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.,3
Before I see thee seated in that throne,3
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.,3
And this the regal seat: possess it York;,3
Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will;,3
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.,3
And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night.,3
And when the king comes offer no violence,3
The queen this day here holds her parliament,3
By words or blows here let us win our right.,3
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,3
And bashful Henry deposed whose cowardice,3
Then leave me not my lords; be resolute;,3
Neither the king nor he that loves him best,3
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.,3
Resolve thee Richard; claim the English crown.,3
My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits,3
Back'd by the power of Warwick that false peer,3
Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father.,3
On him his sons his favourites and his friends.,3
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.,3
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.,3
Patience is for poltroons such as he:,3
My gracious lord here in the parliament,3
Well hast thou spoken cousin: be it so.,3
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?,3
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,3
Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats,3
Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne,3
I am thy sovereign.,3
For shame come down: he made thee Duke of York.,3
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.,3
In following this usurping Henry.,3
True Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.,3
It must and shall be so: content thyself.,3
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;,3
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget,3
And slew your fathers and with colours spread,3
Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief;,3
Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons,3
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.,3
I send thee Warwick such a messenger,3
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!,3
If not our swords shall plead it in the field.,3
Thy father was as thou art Duke of York;,3
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,3
And seized upon their towns and provinces.,3
The lord protector lost it and not I:,3
You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose.,3
Sweet father do so; set it on your head.,3
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.,3
Sons peace!,3
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him lords;,3
For he that interrupts him shall not live.,3
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?,3
Ay and their colours often borne in France,3
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you lords?,3
Prove it Henry and thou shalt be king.,3
Twas by rebellion against his king.,3
Tell me may not a king adopt an heir?,3
An if he may then am I lawful king;,3
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,3
He rose against him being his sovereign,3
Suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd,3
No; for he could not so resign his crown,3
Art thou against us Duke of Exeter?,3
Why whisper you my lords and answer not?,3
[Aside]  All will revolt from me and turn to him.,3
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.,3
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,3
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,3
King Henry be thy title right or wrong,3
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,3
O Clifford how thy words revive my heart!,3
What mutter you or what conspire you lords?,3
Or I will fill the house with armed men,3
Write up his title with usurping blood.,3
My Lord of Warwick hear me but one word:,3
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,3
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,3
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!,3
Base fearful and despairing Henry!,3
I cannot stay to hear these articles.,3
Come cousin let us tell the queen these news.,3
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.,3
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!,3
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!,3
Turn this way Henry and regard them not.,3
Ah Exeter!,3
Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son,3
But be it as it may: I here entail,3
Conditionally that here thou take an oath,3
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,3
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.,3
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.,3
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.,3
Sennet. Here they come down,3
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.,3
And I unto the sea from whence I came.,3
And I with grief and sorrow to the court.,3
Here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger:,3
Exeter so will I.,3
Be patient gentle queen and I will stay.,3
Ah wretched man! would I had died a maid,3
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father,3
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,3
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,3
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir,3
Father you cannot disinherit me:,3
Pardon me Margaret; pardon me sweet son:,3
Enforced thee! art thou king and wilt be forced?,3
Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me;,3
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.,3
What is it but to make thy sepulchre,3
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;,3
The duke is made protector of the realm;,3
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.,3
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes,3
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:,3
Both from thy table Henry and thy bed,3
Whereby my son is disinherited.,3
Will follow mine if once they see them spread;,3
And utter ruin of the house of York.,3
Our army is ready; come we'll after them.,3
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.,3
Ay to be murder'd by his enemies.,3
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.,3
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD,3
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!,3
Whose haughty spirit winged with desire,3
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!,3
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.,3
And I I hope shall reconcile them all.,3
SCENE II. Sandal Castle.,3
Brother though I be youngest give me leave.,3
But I have reasons strong and forcible.,3
Why how now sons and brother! at a strife?,3
No quarrel but a slight contention.,3
About that which concerns your grace and us;,3
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.,3
Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now:,3
It will outrun you father in the end.,3
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:,3
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.,3
I'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak.,3
An oath is of no moment being not took,3
That hath authority over him that swears:,3
Then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,3
Therefore to arms! And father do but think,3
Within whose circuit is Elysium,3
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest,3
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.,3
Brother thou shalt to London presently,3
Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,3
You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham,3
In them I trust; for they are soldiers,3
While you are thus employ'd what resteth more,3
And yet the king not privy to my drift,3
Enter a Messenger,3
The queen with all the northern earls and lords,3
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;,3
Ay with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?,3
My brother Montague shall post to London:,3
Whom we have left protectors of the king,3
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.,3
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.,3
Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER,3
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;,3
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.,3
Ay with five hundred father for a need:,3
A march afar off,3
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.,3
I doubt not uncle of our victory.,3
When as the enemy hath been ten to one:,3
Alarum. Exeunt,3
Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor,3
Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes!,3
Chaplain away! thy priesthood saves thy life.,3
Whose father slew my father he shall die.,3
Soldiers away with him!,3
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!,3
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear,3
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch,3
And so he walks insulting o'er his prey,3
Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword,3
Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die.,3
Be thou revenged on men and let me live.,3
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.,3
He is a man and Clifford cope with him.,3
Were not revenge sufficient for me;,3
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,3
The sight of any of the house of York,3
And till I root out their accursed line,3
Therefore--,3
O let me pray before I take my death!,3
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.,3
Thy father hath.,3
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,3
He be as miserably slain as I.,3
And when I give occasion of offence,3
No cause!,3
Stabs him,3
Dies,3
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade,3
Congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both.,3
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,3
The army of the queen hath got the field:,3
And all my followers to the eager foe,3
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.,3
But this I know they have demean'd themselves,3
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.,3
And full as oft came Edward to my side,3
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:,3
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!',3
A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre!',3
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan,3
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.,3
Ah hark! the fatal followers do pursue;,3
And were I strong I would not shun their fury:,3
Here must I stay and here my life must end.,3
Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland,3
I am your butt and I abide your shot.,3
Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm,3
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,3
My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth,3
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,3
Why come you not? what! multitudes and fear?,3
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;,3
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.,3
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;,3
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice,3
I will not bandy with thee word for word,3
Hold valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes,3
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou Northumberland.,3
To prick thy finger though to wound his heart:,3
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,3
It is war's prize to take all vantages;,3
They lay hands on YORK who struggles,3
So doth the cony struggle in the net.,3
So true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd.,3
Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland,3
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,3
What! was it you that would be England's king?,3
And made a preachment of your high descent?,3
The wanton Edward and the lusty George?,3
Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice,3
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland?,3
That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point,3
And if thine eyes can water for his death,3
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,3
I prithee grieve to make me merry York.,3
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?,3
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus.,3
Thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport:,3
A crown for York! and lords bow low to him:,3
Putting a paper crown on his head,3
Ay this is he that took King Henry's chair,3
But how is it that great Plantagenet,3
As I bethink me you should not be king,3
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,3
Now in his life against your holy oath?,3
Off with the crown and with the crown his head;,3
That is my office for my father's sake.,3
She-wolf of France but worse than wolves of France,3
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex,3
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!,3
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,3
To tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived,3
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,3
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.,3
It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen,3
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.,3
But God he knows thy share thereof is small:,3
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:,3
The want thereof makes thee abominable:,3
As the Antipodes are unto us,3
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!,3
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,3
Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible;,3
Bids't thou me rage? why now thou hast thy wish:,3
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,3
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:,3
Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false,3
Beshrew me but his passion moves me so,3
That face of his the hungry cannibals,3
But you are more inhuman more inexorable,3
See ruthless queen a hapless father's tears:,3
And I with tears do wash the blood away.,3
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,3
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,3
There take the crown and with the crown my curse;,3
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!,3
My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads!,3
I should not for my life but weep with him.,3
What weeping-ripe my Lord Northumberland?,3
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.,3
Stabbing him,3
Stabbing him,3
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.,3
Off with his head and set it on York gates;,3
Flourish. Exeunt,3
SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.,3
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,3
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:,3
Had he been slain we should have heard the news;,3
The happy tidings of his good escape.,3
I cannot joy until I be resolved,3
I saw him in the battle range about;,3
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop,3
Or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs,3
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.,3
So fled his enemies my warlike father:,3
See how the morning opes her golden gates,3
How well resembles it the prime of youth,3
Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns?,3
Not separated with the racking clouds,3
See see! they join embrace and seem to kiss,3
Now are they but one lamp one light one sun.,3
Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of.,3
That we the sons of brave Plantagenet,3
Should notwithstanding join our lights together,3
Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear,3
Nay bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,3
Enter a Messenger,3
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?,3
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,3
O speak no more for I have heard too much.,3
Environed he was with many foes,3
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.,3
And many strokes though with a little axe,3
By many hands your father was subdued;,3
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,3
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,3
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood,3
And after many scorns many foul taunts,3
They set the same; and there it doth remain,3
Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon,3
O Clifford boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain,3
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,3
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:,3
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!,3
Never O never shall I see more joy!,3
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:,3
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal,3
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.,3
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me,3
Or die renowned by attempting it.,3
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.,3
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:,3
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his.,3
How now fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?,3
Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance,3
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.,3
O Warwick Warwick! that Plantagenet,3
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.,3
And now to add more measure to your woes,3
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,3
Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run,3
I then in London keeper of the king,3
And very well appointed as I thought,3
Bearing the king in my behalf along;,3
That she was coming with a full intent,3
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.,3
Our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought:,3
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,3
Or whether 'twas report of her success;,3
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,3
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;,3
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,3
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,3
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,3
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;,3
In haste post-haste are come to join with you:,3
Making another head to fight again.,3
And when came George from Burgundy to England?,3
And for your brother he was lately sent,3
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.,3
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,3
Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear;,3
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,3
Were he as famous and as bold in war,3
I know it well Lord Warwick; blame me not:,3
But in this troublous time what's to be done?,3
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,3
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes,3
If for the last say ay and to it lords.,3
And therefore comes my brother Montague.,3
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,3
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.,3
His oath enrolled in the parliament;,3
To frustrate both his oath and what beside,3
Their power I think is thirty thousand strong:,3
With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March,3
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,3
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,3
But never once again turn back and fly.,3
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,3
Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean;,3
Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend!,3
The next degree is England's royal throne;,3
In every borough as we pass along;,3
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.,3
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,3
Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel,3
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.,3
Enter a Messenger,3
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,3
And craves your company for speedy counsel.,3
Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET  PRINCE EDWARD CLIFFORD and NORTHUMBERLAND with drum and trumpets,3
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy,3
Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord?,3
To see this sight it irks my very soul.,3
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.,3
And harmful pity must be laid aside.,3
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.,3
Not his that spoils her young before her face.,3
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.,3
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.,3
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:,3
And raise his issue like a loving sire;,3
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,3
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;,3
Yet in protection of their tender ones,3
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,3
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?,3
Were it not pity that this goodly boy,3
And long hereafter say unto his child,3
My careless father fondly gave away'?,3
And let his manly face which promiseth,3
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.,3
Inferring arguments of mighty force.,3
That things ill-got had ever bad success?,3
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?,3
And would my father had left me no more!,3
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep,3
Ah cousin York! would thy best friends did know,3
My lord cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,3
You promised knighthood to our forward son:,3
Edward kneel down.,3
And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right.,3
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,3
Why that is spoken like a toward prince.,3
Royal commanders be in readiness:,3
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York;,3
Proclaims him king and many fly to him:,3
I would your highness would depart the field:,3
Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune.,3
Be it with resolution then to fight.,3
And hearten those that fight in your defence:,3
March. Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD WARWICK NORFOLK MONTAGUE and Soldiers,3
And set thy diadem upon my head;,3
Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy!,3
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?,3
I was adopted heir by his consent:,3
You that are king though he do wear the crown,3
To blot out me and put his own son in.,3
Who should succeed the father but the son?,3
Ay crook-back here I stand to answer thee,3
Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it not?,3
For God's sake lords give signal to the fight.,3
Why how now long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?,3
Your legs did better service than your hands.,3
You said so much before and yet you fled.,3
No nor your manhood that durst make you stay.,3
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain,3
Upon that Clifford that cruel child-killer.,3
Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward,3
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.,3
Defy them then or else hold close thy lips.,3
I am a king and privileged to speak.,3
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.,3
By him that made us all I am resolved,3
Say Henry shall I have my right or no?,3
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.,3
For York in justice puts his armour on.,3
There is no wrong but every thing is right.,3
For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue.,3
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,3
As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.,3
Whose father bears the title of a king--,3
Shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught,3
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,3
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,3
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd,3
His father revell'd in the heart of France,3
And had he match'd according to his state,3
But when he took a beggar to his bed,3
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,3
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.,3
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept;,3
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.,3
And that thy summer bred us no increase,3
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,3
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,3
And in this resolution I defy thee;,3
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.,3
And either victory or else a grave.,3
No wrangling woman we'll no longer stay:,3
Exeunt,3
Yorkshire.,3
Forspent with toil as runners with a race,3
For strokes received and many blows repaid,3
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.,3
Smile gentle heaven! or strike ungentle death!,3
How now my lord! what hap? what hope of good?,3
Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair;,3
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?,3
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.,3
Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself?,3
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;,3
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,3
So underneath the belly of their steeds,3
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.,3
I'll kill my horse because I will not fly.,3
Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage;,3
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?,3
I'll never pause again never stand still,3
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.,3
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!,3
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee,3
Beseeching thee if with they will it stands,3
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,3
Now lords take leave until we meet again,3
Brother give me thy hand; and gentle Warwick,3
I that did never weep now melt with woe,3
Away away! Once more sweet lords farewell.,3
And give them leave to fly that will not stay;,3
And if we thrive promise them such rewards,3
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;,3
Forslow no longer make we hence amain.,3
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,3
Now Clifford I have singled thee alone:,3
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,3
Now Richard I am with thee here alone:,3
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;,3
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother,3
And so have at thee!,3
Nay Warwick single out some other chase;,3
Exeunt,3
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone,3
When dying clouds contend with growing light,3
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.,3
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;,3
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:,3
Now one the better then another best;,3
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:,3
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.,3
For Margaret my queen and Clifford too,3
They prosper best of all when I am thence.,3
For what is in this world but grief and woe?,3
To be no better than a homely swain;,3
To carve out dials quaintly point by point,3
How many make the hour full complete;,3
How many days will finish up the year;,3
When this is known then to divide the times:,3
So many hours must I take my rest;,3
So many hours must I sport myself;,3
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:,3
So minutes hours days months and years,3
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.,3
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade,3
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy,3
O yes it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.,3
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.,3
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,3
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,3
When care mistrust and treason waits on him.,3
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.,3
May be possessed with some store of crowns;,3
May yet ere night yield both my life and them,3
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,3
O heavy times begetting such events!,3
My father being the Earl of Warwick's man,3
And I who at his hands received my life him,3
Pardon me God I knew not what I did!,3
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;,3
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!,3
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.,3
And let our hearts and eyes like civil war,3
Enter a Father that has killed his son bringing in the body,3
Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold:,3
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?,3
Ah boy if any life be left in thee,3
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,3
O pity God this miserable age!,3
Erroneous mutinous and unnatural,3
O boy thy father gave thee life too soon,3
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!,3
O pity pity gentle heaven pity!,3
The fatal colours of our striving houses:,3
The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth:,3
If you contend a thousand lives must wither.,3
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!,3
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!,3
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!,3
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?,3
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.,3
Exit with the body,3
My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre,3
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;,3
Even for the loss of thee having no more,3
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,3
Exit with the body,3
Here sits a king more woful than you are.,3
Fly father fly! for all your friends are fled,3
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.,3
Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds,3
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,3
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.,3
Nay stay not to expostulate make speed;,3
Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter:,3
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!,3
SCENE VI. Another part of the field.,3
Here burns my candle out; ay here it dies,3
O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow,3
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;,3
Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York,3
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?,3
O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent,3
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!,3
Or as thy father and his father did,3
They never then had sprung like summer flies;,3
Had left no mourning widows for our death;,3
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?,3
Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds;,3
The foe is merciless and will not pity;,3
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,3
Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest;,3
He faints,3
Now breathe we lords: good fortune bids us pause,3
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,3
As doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust,3
But think you lords that Clifford fled with them?,3
For though before his face I speak the words,3
And wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead.,3
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?,3
See who it is: and now the battle's ended,3
Revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis Clifford;,3
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,3
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,3
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,3
Instead whereof let this supply the room:,3
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,3
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,3
I think his understanding is bereft.,3
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,3
O would he did! and so perhaps he doth:,3
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts,3
If so thou think'st vex him with eager words.,3
Clifford repent in bootless penitence.,3
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.,3
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.,3
They mock thee Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.,3
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.,3
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,3
This hand should chop it off and with the,3
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst,3
Ay but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,3
And now to London with triumphant march,3
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,3
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;,3
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;,3
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.,3
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,3
Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be;,3
And never will I undertake the thing,3
Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,3
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.,3
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.,3
Richard be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,3
Exeunt,3
SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.,3
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;,3
And in this covert will we make our stand,3
I'll stay above the hill so both may shoot.,3
Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost.,3
And for the time shall not seem tedious,3
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.,3
Enter KING HENRY VI disguised with a prayerbook,3
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.,3
Thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee,3
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,3
No not a man comes for redress of thee;,3
Ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:,3
Let me embrace thee sour adversity,3
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.,3
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;,3
Is thither gone to crave the French king's sister,3
Poor queen and son your labour is but lost;,3
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.,3
For she's a woman to be pitied much:,3
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;,3
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,3
Ay but she's come to beg Warwick to give;,3
He on his right asking a wife for Edward.,3
He smiles and says his Edward is install'd;,3
Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong,3
And in conclusion wins the king from her,3
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.,3
Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn!,3
More than I seem and less than I was born to:,3
And men may talk of kings and why not I?,3
Why so I am in mind; and that's enough.,3
My crown is in my heart not on my head;,3
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:,3
Well if you be a king crown'd with content,3
To go along with us; for as we think,3
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance,3
But did you never swear and break an oath?,3
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?,3
I was anointed king at nine months old;,3
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:,3
No;,3
Why am I dead? do I not breathe a man?,3
Look as I blow this feather from my face,3
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,3
Commanded always by the greater gust;,3
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin,3
Go where you will the king shall be commanded;,3
We are true subjects to the king King Edward.,3
If he were seated as King Edward is.,3
To go with us unto the officers.,3
And what God will that let your king perform;,3
Exeunt,3
Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and LADY GREY,3
This lady's husband Sir Richard Grey was slain,3
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;,3
Because in quarrel of the house of York,3
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;,3
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.,3
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!,3
And come some other time to know our mind.,3
May it please your highness to resolve me now;,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay widow? then I'll warrant,3
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not unless she,3
[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll,3
How many children hast thou widow? tell me.,3
child of her.,3
give her two.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four if you'll,3
Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.,3
Lords give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.,3
you will have leave,3
GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire,3
Ay full as dearly as I love myself.,3
To do them good I would sustain some harm.,3
Therefore I came unto your majesty.,3
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.,3
What you command that rests in me to do.,3
No gracious lord except I cannot do it.,3
Why then I will do what your grace commands.,3
wears the marble.,3
her wax must melt.,3
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.,3
Why then thy husband's lands I freely give thee.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it,3
But stay thee 'tis the fruits of love I mean.,3
Ay but I fear me in another sense.,3
My love till death my humble thanks my prayers;,3
No by my troth I did not mean such love.,3
But now you partly may perceive my mind.,3
Your highness aims at if I aim aright.,3
To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison.,3
Why then mine honesty shall be my dower;,3
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.,3
But mighty lord this merry inclination,3
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.',3
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.,3
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not she,3
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in,3
[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;,3
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:,3
And she shall be my love or else my queen.--,3
Tis better said than done my gracious lord:,3
But far unfit to be a sovereign.,3
I speak no more than what my soul intends;,3
And that is more than I will yield unto:,3
And yet too good to be your concubine.,3
Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.,3
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children;,3
Have other some: why 'tis a happy thing,3
Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen.,3
his shrift.,3
twas for shift.,3
The widow likes it not for she looks very sad.,3
To whom my lord?,3
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.,3
By so much is the wonder in extremes.,3
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.,3
My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken,3
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:,3
To question of his apprehension.,3
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER,3
Would he were wasted marrow bones and all,3
To cross me from the golden time I look for!,3
The lustful Edward's title buried--,3
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,3
A cold premeditation for my purpose!,3
Like one that stands upon a promontory,3
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,3
Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way:,3
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;,3
Flattering me with impossibilities.,3
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.,3
What other pleasure can the world afford?,3
And deck my body in gay ornaments,3
O miserable thought! and more unlikely,3
Why love forswore me in my  mother's womb:,3
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,3
To make an envious mountain on my back,3
To shape my legs of an unequal size;,3
Like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear-whelp,3
And am I then a man to be beloved?,3
Then since this earth affords no joy to me,3
As are of better person than myself,3
And whiles I live to account this world but hell,3
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.,3
For many lives stand between me and home:,3
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,3
Not knowing how to find the open air,3
Torment myself to catch the English crown:,3
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.,3
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,3
And frame my face to all occasions.,3
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;,3
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,3
I can add colours to the chameleon,3
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.,3
Tut were it farther off I'll pluck it down.,3
SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.,3
Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret,3
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.,3
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve,3
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:,3
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;,3
And to my humble seat conform myself.,3
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears,3
Whate'er it be be thou still like thyself,3
Seats her by him,3
To fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind,3
Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief;,3
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts,3
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis,3
Is of a king become a banish'd man,3
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York,3
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.,3
With this my son Prince Edward Henry's heir,3
And if thou fail us all our hope is done:,3
Our people and our peers are both misled,3
And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight.,3
While we bethink a means to break it off.,3
The more I stay the more I'll succor thee.,3
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!,3
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?,3
Welcome brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?,3
Ay now begins a second storm to rise;,3
From worthy Edward King of Albion,3
I come in kindness and unfeigned love,3
And then to crave a league of amity;,3
With a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant,3
To England's king in lawful marriage.,3
[To BONA]  And gracious madam in our king's behalf,3
Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue,3
Where fame late entering at his heedful ears,3
King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak,3
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,3
For how can tyrants safely govern home,3
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,3
Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry's son.,3
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;,3
Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs.,3
And why not queen?,3
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.,3
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;,3
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;,3
Who by his prowess conquered all France:,3
Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse,3
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?,3
But for the rest you tell a pedigree,3
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.,3
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,3
Can Oxford that did ever fence the right,3
For shame! leave Henry and call Edward king.,3
My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere,3
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,3
No Warwick no; while life upholds this arm,3
And I the house of York.,3
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside,3
They stand aloof,3
Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience,3
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.,3
But is he gracious in the people's eye?,3
Then further all dissembling set aside,3
Unto our sister Bona.,3
As may beseem a monarch like himself.,3
That this his love was an eternal plant,3
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,3
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.,3
Your grant or your denial shall be mine:,3
Yet I confess that often ere this day,3
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.,3
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn,3
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.,3
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.,3
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device,3
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.,3
But if your title to the crown be weak,3
Then 'tis but reason that I be released,3
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand,3
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,3
And as for you yourself our quondam queen,3
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.,3
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!,3
Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold,3
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.,3
Warwick this is some post to us or thee.,3
[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador these letters are for you,3
To KING LEWIS XI,3
To QUEEN MARGARET,3
They all read their letters,3
Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his.,3
I hope all's for the best.,3
Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.,3
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!,3
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?,3
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?,3
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.,3
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,3
No more my king for he dishonours me,3
Did I forget that by the house of York,3
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?,3
Did I put Henry from his native right?,3
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:,3
I here renounce him and return to Henry.,3
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:,3
And replant Henry in his former state.,3
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,3
So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend,3
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,3
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.,3
And as for Clarence as my letters tell me,3
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,3
Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged,3
Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live,3
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.,3
And mine with hers and thine and Margaret's.,3
You shall have aid.,3
Then England's messenger return in post,3
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers,3
Thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal.,3
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.,3
And I am ready to put armour on.,3
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.,3
Exit Post,3
Thou and Oxford with five thousand men,3
And as occasion serves this noble queen,3
Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt,3
This shall assure my constant loyalty,3
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy,3
Yes I agree and thank you for your motion.,3
Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick;,3
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.,3
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand.,3
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,3
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.,3
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.,3
I came from Edward as ambassador,3
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,3
Had he none else to make a stale but me?,3
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,3
Not that I pity Henry's misery,3
Exit,3
SCENE I. London. The palace.,3
Now tell me brother Clarence what think you,3
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?,3
How could he stay till Warwick made return?,3
And his well-chosen bride.,3
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV attended; QUEEN ELIZABETH PEMBROKE STAFFORD HASTINGS and others,3
That you stand pensive as half malcontent?,3
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment,3
Suppose they take offence without a cause,3
Your king and Warwick's and must have my will.,3
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.,3
Not I:,3
Whom God hath join'd together; ay and 'twere pity,3
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,3
Should not become my wife and England's queen.,3
Speak freely what you think.,3
Becomes your enemy for mocking him,3
And Warwick doing what you gave in charge,3
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased,3
Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance,3
Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.,3
England is safe if true within itself?,3
Tis better using France than trusting France:,3
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,3
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.,3
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.,3
And for this once my will shall stand for law.,3
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales,3
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:,3
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir,3
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.,3
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.,3
Which being shallow you give me leave,3
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.,3
And not be tied unto his brother's will.,3
To raise my state to title of a queen,3
That I was not ignoble of descent;,3
But as this title honours me and mine,3
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.,3
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,3
And their true sovereign whom they must obey?,3
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;,3
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.,3
Enter a Post,3
From France?,3
But such as I without your special pardon,3
Go to we pardon thee: therefore in brief,3
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?,3
Go tell false Edward thy supposed king,3
To revel it with him and his new bride.',3
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?,3
Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,3
I blame not her she could say little less;,3
For I have heard that she was there in place.,3
And I am ready to put armour on.',3
But what said Warwick to these injuries?,3
Than all the rest discharged me with these words:,3
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.',3
Well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd:,3
But say is Warwick friends with Margaret?,3
friendship,3
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.,3
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;,3
I may not prove inferior to yourself.,3
Exit CLARENCE and SOMERSET follows,3
My thoughts aim at a further matter; I,3
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!,3
And haste is needful in this desperate case.,3
Go levy men and make prepare for war;,3
Myself in person will straight follow you.,3
But ere I go Hastings and Montague,3
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:,3
If it be so then both depart to him;,3
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,3
That I may never have you in suspect.,3
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!,3
Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you.,3
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,3
Exeunt,3
Enter WARWICK and OXFORD with French soldiers,3
The common people by numbers swarm to us.,3
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!,3
Fear not that my lord.,3
And welcome Somerset: I hold it cowardice,3
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;,3
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:,3
And now what rests but in night's coverture,3
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,3
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?,3
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede,3
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,3
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard,3
For I intend but only to surprise him.,3
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.,3
Why then let's on our way in silent sort:,3
Exeunt,3
Enter three Watchmen to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent,3
The king by this is set him down to sleep.,3
Why no; for he hath made a solemn vow,3
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.,3
If Warwick be so near as men report.,3
That with the king here resteth in his tent?,3
O is it so? But why commands the king,3
While he himself keeps in the cold field?,3
Ay but give me worship and quietness;,3
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,3
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.,3
But to defend his person from night-foes?,3
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.,3
But follow me and Edward shall be ours.,3
Stay or thou diest!,3
The drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter  WARWICK SOMERSET and the rest bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage,3
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.,3
Thou call'dst me king.,3
When you disgraced me in my embassade,3
And come now to create you Duke of York.,3
That know not how to use ambassadors,3
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,3
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?,3
Nay then I see that Edward needs must down.,3
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,3
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,3
Then for his mind be Edward England's king:,3
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,3
My Lord of Somerset at my request,3
Unto my brother Archbishop of York.,3
I'll follow you and tell what answer,3
Now for a while farewell good Duke of York.,3
What fates impose that men must needs abide;,3
Exit guarded,3
But march to London with our soldiers?,3
To free King Henry from imprisonment,3
Exeunt,3
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS,3
Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn,3
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?,3
Then is my sovereign slain?,3
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard,3
And as I further have to understand,3
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.,3
Yet gracious madam bear it as you may:,3
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.,3
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:,3
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;,3
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,3
King Edward's fruit true heir to the English crown.,3
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,3
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,3
For trust not him that hath once broken faith--,3
To save at least the heir of Edward's right:,3
Come therefore let us fly while we may fly:,3
Exeunt,3
Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and STANLEY,3
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,3
Thus stands the case: you know our king my brother,3
He hath good usage and great liberty,3
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.,3
That if about this hour he make his way,3
He shall here find his friends with horse and men,3
Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him,3
Nay this way man: see where the huntsmen stand.,3
Stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer?,3
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.,3
To Lynn my lord,3
Well guess'd believe me; for that was my meaning.,3
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.,3
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.,3
Bishop farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;,3
Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI CLARENCE WARWICK  SOMERSET HENRY OF RICHMOND OXFORD MONTAGUE and Lieutenant of the Tower,3
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,3
My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys,3
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;,3
I then crave pardon of your majesty.,3
Nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,3
Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds,3
At last by notes of household harmony,3
But Warwick after God thou set'st me free,3
He was the author thou the instrument.,3
By living low where fortune cannot hurt me,3
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,3
I here resign my government to thee,3
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;,3
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,3
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,3
No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway,3
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,3
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.,3
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:,3
That no dissension hinder government:,3
While I myself will lead a private life,3
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.,3
That he consents if Warwick yield consent;,3
Why then though loath yet must I be content:,3
To Henry's body and supply his place;,3
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.,3
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,3
What else? and that succession be determined.,3
But with the first of all your chief affairs,3
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward,3
For till I see them here by doubtful fear,3
It shall be done my sovereign with all speed.,3
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?,3
Come hither England's hope.,3
If secret powers,3
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.,3
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,3
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.,3
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.,3
What news my friend?,3
And fled as he hears since to Burgundy.,3
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester,3
In secret ambush on the forest side,3
For hunting was his daily exercise.,3
But let us hence my sovereign to provide,3
Exeunt all but SOMERSET HENRY OF RICHMOND and OXFORD,3
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,3
As Henry's late presaging prophecy,3
So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts,3
Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst,3
Till storms be past of civil enmity.,3
Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.,3
Come therefore let's about it speedily.,3
SCENE VII. Before York.,3
Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest,3
And says that once more I shall interchange,3
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas,3
What then remains we being thus arrived,3
But that we enter as into our dukedom?,3
For many men that stumble at the threshold,3
Tush man abodements must not now affright us:,3
For hither will our friends repair to us.,3
Enter on the walls the Mayor of York and his Brethren,3
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;,3
But master mayor if Henry be your king,3
True my good lord; I know you for no less.,3
As being well content with that alone.,3
He'll soon find means to make the body follow.,3
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.,3
They descend,3
The good old man would fain that all were well,3
I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade,3
Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen below,3
But in the night or in the time of war.,3
Takes his keys,3
And all those friends that deign to follow me.,3
Brother this is Sir John Montgomery,3
Welcome Sir John! But why come you in arms?,3
As every loyal subject ought to do.,3
Our title to the crown and only claim,3
Then fare you well for I will hence again:,3
Drummer strike up and let us march away.,3
Nay stay Sir John awhi le and we'll debate,3
What talk you of debating? in few words,3
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone,3
Why shall we fight if you pretend no title?,3
When we grow stronger then we'll make our claim:,3
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.,3
Brother we will proclaim you out of hand:,3
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,3
Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself;,3
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:,3
Flourish,3
England and France and lord of Ireland  and c.,3
By this I challenge him to single fight.,3
Long live Edward the Fourth!,3
If fortune serve me I'll requite this kindness.,3
And when the morning sun shall raise his car,3
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;,3
Ah froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee,3
Yet as we may we'll meet both thee and Warwick.,3
And that once gotten doubt not of large pay.,3
SCENE VIII. London. The palace.,3
What counsel lords? Edward from Belgia,3
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,3
And many giddy people flock to him.,3
A little fire is quickly trodden out;,3
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,3
Those will I muster up: and thou son Clarence,3
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:,3
Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find,3
And thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved,3
My sovereign with the loving citizens,3
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,3
Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply.,3
Farewell my Hector and my Troy's true hope.,3
Well-minded Clarence be thou fortunate!,3
And thus I seal my truth and bid adieu.,3
And all at once once more a happy farewell.,3
Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER,3
Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship?,3
Should not be able to encounter mine.,3
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:,3
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;,3
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,3
I have not been desirous of their wealth,3
Nor forward of revenge though they much err'd:,3
No Exeter these graces challenge grace:,3
The lamb will never cease to follow him.,3
Hark hark my lord! what shouts are these?,3
Seize on the shame-faced Henry bear him hence;,3
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:,3
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.,3
Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI,3
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:,3
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.,3
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:,3
Exeunt,3
SCENE I. Coventry.,3
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?,3
By this at Dunsmore marching hitherward.,3
Where is the post that came from Montague?,3
Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE,3
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now?,3
And do expect him here some two hours hence.,3
Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum.,3
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.,3
They are at hand and you shall quickly know.,3
Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle.,3
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?,3
That we could hear no news of his repair?,3
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,3
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.,3
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,3
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.,3
Or did he make the jest against his will?,3
Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give:,3
Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.,3
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:,3
And Henry is my king Warwick his subject.,3
And gallant Warwick do but answer this:,3
Alas that Warwick had no more forecast,3
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!,3
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower.,3
Come Warwick take the time; kneel down kneel down:,3
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,3
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.,3
This hand fast wound about thy coal-black hair,3
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,3
Enter OXFORD with drum and colours,3
Oxford Oxford for Lancaster!,3
The gates are open let us enter too.,3
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt,3
If not the city being but of small defence,3
O welcome Oxford! for we want thy help.,3
Montague Montague for Lancaster!,3
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason,3
The harder match'd the greater victory:,3
Enter SOMERSET with drum and colours,3
He and his forces enter the city,3
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;,3
Enter CLARENCE with drum and colours,3
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;,3
More than the nature of a brother's love!,3
Father of Warwick know you what this means?,3
Look here I throw my infamy at thee,3
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,3
That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural,3
Against his brother and his lawful king?,3
To keep that oath were more impiety,3
I am so sorry for my trespass made,3
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,3
As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad--,3
And so proud-hearted Warwick I defy thee,3
Pardon me Edward I will make amends:,3
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.,3
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.,3
O passing traitor perjured and unjust!,3
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?,3
I will away towards Barnet presently,3
Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way.,3
Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow,3
Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV bringing forth WARWICK wounded,3
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.,3
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.,3
Ah who is nigh? come to me friend or foe,3
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,3
That I must yield my body to the earth,3
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,3
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,3
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.,3
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,3
The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood,3
For who lived king but I could dig his grave?,3
Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!,3
Even now forsake me and of all my lands,3
Why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust?,3
Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET,3
We might recover all our loss again;,3
Even now we heard the news: ah could'st thou fly!,3
If thou be there sweet brother take my hand.,3
Thou lovest me not; for brother if thou didst,3
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.,3
Ah Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;,3
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.',3
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,3
I well might hear delivered with a groan,3
Sweet rest his soul! Fly lords and save yourselves;,3
Dies,3
Here they bear away his body. Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and the rest,3
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.,3
I spy a black suspicious threatening cloud,3
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:,3
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast,3
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud,3
The very beams will dry those vapours up,3
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,3
If she have time to breathe be well assured,3
We are advertised by our loving friends,3
We having now the best at Barnet field,3
And as we march our strength will be augmented,3
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.,3
SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury.,3
Great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,3
What though the mast be now blown overboard,3
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?,3
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad,3
And give more strength to that which hath too much,3
Which industry and courage might have saved?,3
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?,3
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?,3
And Somerset another goodly mast?,3
And though unskilful why not Ned and I,3
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,3
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.,3
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?,3
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?,3
Say you can swim; alas 'tis but a while!,3
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,3
This speak I lords to let you understand,3
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers,3
Why courage then! what cannot be avoided,3
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit,3
Infuse his breast with magnanimity,3
I speak not this as doubting any here,3
He should have leave to go away betimes,3
And make him of like spirit to himself.,3
Let him depart before we need his help.,3
And warriors faint! why 'twere perpetual shame.,3
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live,3
And he that will not fight for such a hope.,3
If he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at.,3
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.,3
Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand.,3
I thought no less: it is his policy,3
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.,3
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.,3
Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood,3
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.,3
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out,3
Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say,3
Ye see I drink the water of mine eyes.,3
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,3
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;,3
You fight in justice: then in God's name lords,3
Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt,3
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV GLOUCESTER CLARENCE  and soldiers; with QUEEN MARGARET OXFORD and SOMERSET prisoners,3
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:,3
Go bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.,3
Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune.,3
So part we sadly in this troublous world,3
Is proclamation made that who finds Edward,3
It is: and lo where youthful Edward comes!,3
Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak.,3
Edward what satisfaction canst thou make,3
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?,3
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;,3
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,3
Ah that thy father had been so resolved!,3
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.,3
His currish riddles sort not with this place.,3
Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men.,3
Nay take away this scolding crookback rather.,3
Untutor'd lad thou art too malapert.,3
Lascivious Edward and thou perjured George,3
I am your better traitors as ye are:,3
Take that thou likeness of this railer here.,3
Sprawl'st thou? take that to end thy agony.,3
And there's for twitting me with perjury.,3
O kill me too!,3
Offers to kill her,3
Why should she live to fill the world with words?,3
Clarence excuse me to the king my brother;,3
Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news.,3
The Tower the Tower.,3
O Ned sweet Ned! speak to thy mother boy!,3
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,3
If this foul deed were by to equal it:,3
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.,3
No no my heart will burst and if I speak:,3
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!,3
You have no children butchers! if you had,3
But if you ever chance to have a child,3
As deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince!,3
Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here,3
What wilt thou not? then Clarence do it thou.,3
Good Clarence do; sweet Clarence do thou do it.,3
Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself:,3
What wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,3
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;,3
Away I say; I charge ye bear her hence.,3
Exit led out forcibly,3
To London all in post; and as I guess,3
He's sudden if a thing comes in his head.,3
With pay and thanks and let's away to London,3
By this I hope she hath a son for me.,3
SCENE VI. London. The Tower.,3
Good day my lord. What at your book so hard?,3
Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:,3
And both preposterous; therefore not 'good lord.',3
Exit Lieutenant,3
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,3
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?,3
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.,3
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;,3
Have now the fatal object in my eye,3
Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete,3
An yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd.,3
Thy father Minos that denied our course;,3
Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea,3
Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words!,3
Than can my ears that tragic history.,3
Think'st thou I am an executioner?,3
If murdering innocents be executing,3
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.,3
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.,3
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,3
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--,3
And orphans for their parents timeless death--,3
The owl shriek'd at thy birth--an evil sign;,3
Dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees;,3
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.,3
And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,3
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.,3
To signify thou camest to bite the world:,3
Thou camest--,3
Stabs him,3
Ay and for much more slaughter after this.,3
Dies,3
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.,3
O may such purple tears be alway shed,3
If any spark of life be yet remaining,3
Stabs him again,3
Indeed 'tis true that Henry told me of;,3
I came into the world with my legs forward:,3
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?,3
O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth!',3
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.,3
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.,3
And this word 'love' which graybeards call divine,3
And not in me: I am myself alone.,3
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;,3
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,3
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:,3
Counting myself but bad till I be best.,3
And triumph Henry in thy day of doom.,3
SCENE VII. London. The palace.,3
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,3
What valiant foemen like to autumn's corn,3
Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd,3
Two Cliffords as the father and the son,3
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;,3
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion,3
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat,3
Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy.,3
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,3
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;,3
[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;,3
This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;,3
Work thou the way--and thou shalt execute.,3
And kiss your princely nephew brothers both.,3
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.,3
And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,3
Aside,3
Now am I seated as my soul delights,3
What will your grace have done with Margaret?,3
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,3
Away with her and waft her hence to France.,3
With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows,3
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!,3
Exeunt,3
SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,4
In delivering my son from me I bury a second husband.,4
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command to,4
You shall find of the king a husband madam; you,4
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose,4
than lack it where there is such abundance.,4
He hath abandoned his physicians madam; under whose,4
finds no other advantage in the process but only the,4
This young gentlewoman had a father--O that,4
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so,4
should have play for lack of work. Would for the,4
the death of the king's disease.,4
He was famous sir in his profession and it was,4
He was excellent indeed madam: the king very,4
was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge,4
What is it my good lord the king languishes of?,4
I heard not of it before.,4
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?,4
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that,4
inherits which makes fair gifts fairer; for where,4
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and,4
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.,4
Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise,4
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all,4
go to no more; lest it be rather thought you affect,4
I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too.,4
excessive grief the enemy to the living.,4
makes it soon mortal.,4
How understand we that?,4
In manners as in shape! thy blood and virtue,4
Share with thy birthright! Love all trust a few,4
Rather in power than use and keep thy friend,4
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,4
Fall on thy head! Farewell my lord;,4
Advise him.,4
That shall attend his love.,4
Exit,4
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable,4
Farewell pretty lady: you must hold the credit of,4
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU,4
And these great tears grace his remembrance more,4
I have forgot him: my imagination,4
I am undone: there is no living none,4
That I should love a bright particular star,4
In his bright radiance and collateral light,4
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:,4
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty though plague,4
His arched brows his hawking eye his curls,4
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:,4
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?,4
Aside,4
And yet I know him a notorious liar,4
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,4
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal full oft we see,4
Save you fair queen!,4
No.,4
Are you meditating on virginity?,4
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how,4
Keep him out.,4
in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some,4
There is none: man sitting down before you will,4
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and,4
virgins might blow up men?,4
blown up: marry in blowing him down again with,4
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to,4
increase and there was never virgin got till,4
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost,4
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!,4
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the,4
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible,4
virginity murders itself and should be buried in,4
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,4
paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach.,4
self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the,4
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make,4
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!,4
Let me see: marry ill to like him that ne'er it,4
lying; the longer kept the less worth: off with 't,4
Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out,4
like the brooch and the tooth-pick which wear not,4
porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,4
withered pears it looks ill it eats drily; marry,4
marry yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?,4
There shall your master have a thousand loves,4
A phoenix captain and an enemy,4
A counsellor a traitress and a dear;,4
His jarring concord and his discord dulcet,4
Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms,4
I know not what he shall. God send him well!,4
What one i' faith?,4
What's pity?,4
Which might be felt; that we the poorer born,4
Might with effects of them follow our friends,4
Return us thanks.,4
Monsieur Parolles my lord calls for you.,4
Little Helen farewell; if I can remember thee I,4
Monsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable star.,4
I especially think under Mars.,4
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs,4
When he was predominant.,4
Why think you so?,4
That's for advantage.,4
but the composition that your valour and fear makes,4
I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee,4
which my instruction shall serve to naturalize,4
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon,4
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When,4
none remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,4
Exit,4
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky,4
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.,4
That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye?,4
To join like likes and kiss like native things.,4
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose,4
So show her merit that did miss her love?,4
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.,4
SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.,4
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;,4
A braving war.,4
Nay 'tis most credible; we here received it,4
With caution that the Florentine will move us,4
Prejudicates the business and would seem,4
His love and wisdom,4
For amplest credence.,4
And Florence is denied before he comes:,4
The Tuscan service freely have they leave,4
It well may serve,4
For breathing and exploit.,4
Enter BERTRAM LAFEU and PAROLLES,4
Young Bertram.,4
Frank nature rather curious than in haste,4
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.,4
I would I had that corporal soundness now,4
First tried our soldiership! He did look far,4
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;,4
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me,4
He had the wit which I can well observe,4
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted,4
So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness,4
His equal had awaked them and his honour,4
Exception bid him speak and at this time,4
He used as creatures of another place,4
Making them proud of his humility,4
Might be a copy to these younger times;,4
But goers backward.,4
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;,4
As in your royal speech.,4
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words,4
To grow there and to bear--'Let me not live'--,4
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,4
After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff,4
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are,4
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;,4
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,4
To give some labourers room.,4
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.,4
Since the physician at your father's died?,4
Some six months since my lord.,4
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out,4
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome count;,4
Thank your majesty.,4
SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,4
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?,4
wish might be found in the calendar of my past,4
foul the clearness of our deservings when of,4
What does this knave here? Get you gone sirrah:,4
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know,4
enough to make such knaveries yours.,4
Well sir.,4
many of the rich are damned: but if I may have,4
the woman and I will do as we may.,4
I do beg your good will in this case.,4
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no,4
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for,4
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.,4
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.,4
Faith madam I have other holy reasons such as they,4
May the world know them?,4
all flesh and blood are; and indeed I do marry,4
Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness.,4
friends for my wife's sake.,4
You're shallow madam in great friends; for the,4
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me,4
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher,4
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my,4
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to,4
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the,4
religion their heads are both one; they may jowl,4
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?,4
way:,4
Which men full true shall find;,4
Your cuckoo sings by kind.,4
May it please you madam that he bid Helen come to,4
Sirrah tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;,4
Was this fair face the cause quoth she,4
Fond done done fond,4
With that she sighed as she stood,4
And gave this sentence then;,4
Among nine bad if one be good,4
What one good in ten? you corrupt the song sirrah.,4
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all,4
if I were the parson. One in ten quoth a'! An we,4
star or at an earthquake 'twould mend the lottery,4
one.,4
That man should be at woman's command and yet no,4
will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of,4
going forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.,4
Well now.,4
Faith I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and,4
make title to as much love as she finds: there is,4
her than she'll demand.,4
she wished me: alone she was and did communicate,4
thought I dare vow for her they touched not any,4
Fortune she said was no goddess that had put,4
god that would not extend his might only where,4
would suffer her poor knight surprised without,4
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of,4
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;,4
you something to know it.,4
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this,4
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,4
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.,4
Enter HELENA,4
If ever we are nature's these are ours; this thorn,4
Our blood to us this to our blood is born;,4
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:,4
Such were our faults or then we thought them none.,4
What is your pleasure madam?,4
I am a mother to you.,4
Nay a mother:,4
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother',4
And put you in the catalogue of those,4
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds,4
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,4
God's mercy maiden! does it curd thy blood,4
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,4
Why? that you are my daughter?,4
I say I am your mother.,4
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:,4
No note upon my parents his all noble:,4
His servant live and will his vassal die:,4
Nor I your mother?,4
So that my lord your son were not my brother--,4
I care no more for than I do for heaven,4
But I your daughter he must be my brother?,4
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother,4
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see,4
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross,4
Against the proclamation of thy passion,4
But tell me then 'tis so; for look thy cheeks,4
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors,4
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,4
If it be so you have wound a goodly clew;,4
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,4
Good madam pardon me!,4
Your pardon noble mistress!,4
Do not you love him madam?,4
Whereof the world takes note: come come disclose,4
Have to the full appeach'd.,4
Here on my knee before high heaven and you,4
I love your son.,4
Be not offended; for it hurts not him,4
By any token of presumptuous suit;,4
Yet never know how that desert should be.,4
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve,4
And lack not to lose still: thus Indian-like,4
The sun that looks upon his worshipper,4
Let not your hate encounter with my love,4
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,4
Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian,4
To her whose state is such that cannot choose,4
That seeks not to find that her search implies,4
Had you not lately an intent--speak truly--,4
Madam I had.,4
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.,4
Of rare and proved effects such as his reading,4
For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me,4
As notes whose faculties inclusive were,4
There is a remedy approved set down,4
The king is render'd lost.,4
For Paris was it? speak.,4
Else Paris and the medicine and the king,4
Haply been absent then.,4
If you should tender your supposed aid,4
Are of a mind; he that they cannot help him,4
A poor unlearned virgin when the schools,4
The danger to itself?,4
More than my father's skill which was the greatest,4
Shall for my legacy be sanctified,4
But give me leave to try success I'ld venture,4
By such a day and hour.,4
Ay madam knowingly.,4
Means and attendants and my loving greetings,4
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:,4
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.,4
ACT II,4
Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING attended  with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES,4
Do not throw from you: and you my lords farewell:,4
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,4
Tis our hope sir,4
And find your grace in health.,4
Will not confess he owes the malady,4
Whether I live or die be you the sons,4
Those bated that inherit but the fall,4
Not to woo honour but to wed it; when,4
That fame may cry you loud: I say farewell.,4
Those girls of Italy take heed of them:,4
If they demand: beware of being captives,4
Our hearts receive your warnings.,4
Exit attended,4
Tis not his fault the spark.,4
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.,4
Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.',4
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,4
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn,4
There's honour in the theft.,4
I am your accessary; and so farewell.,4
Farewell captain.,4
Noble heroes my sword and yours are kin. Good,4
find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain,4
on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword,4
reports for me.,4
Exeunt Lords,4
Stay: the king.,4
[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the,4
list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to,4
time there do muster true gait eat speak and,4
and though the devil lead the measure such are to,4
And I will do so.,4
Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES,4
[Kneeling]  Pardon my lord for me and for my tidings.,4
Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.,4
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.,4
And ask'd thee mercy for't.,4
Will you be cured of your infirmity?,4
O will you eat no grapes my royal fox?,4
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine,4
Quicken a rock and make you dance canary,4
Is powerful to araise King Pepin nay,4
And write to her a love-line.,4
Why Doctor She: my lord there's one arrived,4
If seriously I may convey my thoughts,4
With one that in her sex her years profession,4
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her,4
That done laugh well at me.,4
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee,4
By wondering how thou took'st it.,4
And not be all day neither.,4
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.,4
Nay come your ways.,4
Nay come your ways:,4
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors,4
That dare leave two together; fare you well.,4
Now fair one does your business follow us?,4
Gerard de Narbon was my father;,4
I knew him.,4
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death,4
Which as the dearest issue of his practise,4
He bade me store up as a triple eye,4
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd,4
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,4
With all bound humbleness.,4
But may not be so credulous of cure,4
The congregated college have concluded,4
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not,4
To prostitute our past-cure malady,4
Our great self and our credit to esteem,4
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:,4
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts,4
I cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful:,4
As one near death to those that wish him live:,4
I knowing all my peril thou no art.,4
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.,4
Oft does them by the weakest minister:,4
When judges have been babes; great floods have flown,4
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.,4
Where most it promises and oft it hits,4
I must not hear thee; fare thee well kind maid;,4
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.,4
It is not so with Him that all things knows,4
But most it is presumption in us when,4
Dear sir to my endeavours give consent;,4
I am not an impostor that proclaim,4
But know I think and think I know most sure,4
Are thou so confident? within what space,4
The great'st grace lending grace,4
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,4
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,4
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,4
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.,4
What darest thou venture?,4
A strumpet's boldness a divulged shame,4
Sear'd otherwise; nay worse--if worse--extended,4
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak,4
And what impossibility would slay,4
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate,4
Youth beauty wisdom courage all,4
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate,4
Sweet practiser thy physic I will try,4
If I break time or flinch in property,4
And well deserved: not helping death's my fee;,4
Make thy demand.,4
Ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.,4
What husband in thy power I will command:,4
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,4
With any branch or image of thy state;,4
Is free for me to ask thee to bestow.,4
Thy will by my performance shall be served:,4
Thy resolved patient on thee still rely.,4
Though more to know could not be more to trust,4
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.,4
As high as word my deed shall match thy meed.,4
SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,4
Come on sir; I shall now put you to the height of,4
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I,4
To the court! why what place make you special,4
Truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he,4
a leg put off's cap kiss his hand and say nothing,4
such a fellow to say precisely were not for the,4
men.,4
questions.,4
the pin-buttock the quatch-buttock the brawn,4
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?,4
as your French crown for your taffeta punk as Tib's,4
Tuesday a morris for May-day as the nail to his,4
to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the,4
Have you I say an answer of such fitness for all,4
From below your duke to beneath your constable it,4
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that,4
But a trifle neither in good faith if the learned,4
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall,4
To be young again if we could: I will be a fool in,4
pray you sir are you a courtier?,4
more a hundred of them.,4
O Lord sir! Thick thick spare not me.,4
O Lord sir! Nay put me to't I warrant you.,4
O Lord sir! spare not me.,4
spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord sir!' is very,4
to a whipping if you were but bound to't.,4
sir!' I see things may serve long but not serve ever.,4
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.,4
An end sir; to your business. Give Helen this,4
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:,4
Not much commendation to them.,4
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.,4
Exeunt severally,4
Enter BERTRAM LAFEU and PAROLLES,4
philosophical persons to make modern and familiar,4
we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves,4
ourselves to an unknown fear.,4
shot out in our latter times.,4
To be relinquish'd of the artists--,4
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.,4
Of all the learned and authentic fellows--,4
That gave him out incurable--,4
Not to be helped--,4
Uncertain life and sure death.,4
I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.,4
shall read it in--what do you call there?,4
That's it; I would have said the very same.,4
I speak in respect--,4
brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most,4
Very hand of heaven.,4
In a most weak--,4
and debile minister great power great,4
further use to be made than alone the recovery of,4
pausing,4
I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.,4
Lustig as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the,4
able to lead her a coranto.,4
Fore God I think so.,4
Sit my preserver by thy patient's side;,4
Thou hast repeal'd a second time receive,4
Which but attends thy naming.,4
Fair maid send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel,4
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice,4
Thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake.,4
Fall when Love please! marry to each but one!,4
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',4
Peruse them well:,4
Gentlemen,4
We understand it and thank heaven for you.,4
That I protest I simply am a maid.,4
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,4
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;,4
Make choice; and see,4
Now Dian from thy altar do I fly,4
Do my sighs stream. Sir will you hear my suit?,4
Thanks sir; all the rest is mute.,4
for my life.,4
Before I speak too threateningly replies:,4
Her that so wishes and her humble love!,4
My wish receive,4
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,4
Turk to make eunuchs of.,4
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:,4
Find fairer fortune if you ever wed!,4
sure they are bastards to the English; the French,4
You are too young too happy and too good,4
Fair one I think not so.,4
wine: but if thou be'st not an ass I am a youth,4
[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give,4
Into your guiding power. This is the man.,4
My wife my liege! I shall beseech your highness,4
The help of mine own eyes.,4
What she has done for me?,4
But never hope to know why I should marry her.,4
But follows it my lord to bring me down,4
She had her breeding at my father's charge.,4
Rather corrupt me ever!,4
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,4
Would quite confound distinction yet stand off,4
All that is virtuous save what thou dislikest,4
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:,4
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:,4
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone,4
The property by what it is should go,4
In these to nature she's immediate heir,4
Which challenges itself as honour's born,4
When rather from our acts we them derive,4
Debosh'd on every tomb on every grave,4
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb,4
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,4
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.,4
Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose.,4
Let the rest go.,4
I must produce my power. Here take her hand,4
That dost in vile misprision shackle up,4
We poising us in her defective scale,4
It is in us to plant thine honour where,4
Obey our will which travails in thy good:,4
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right,4
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever,4
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate,4
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.,4
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider,4
Flies where you bid it I find that she which late,4
The praised of the king; who so ennobled,4
Take her by the hand,4
A counterpoise if not to thy estate,4
I take her hand.,4
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony,4
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast,4
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,4
Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES,4
Your pleasure sir?,4
recantation.,4
Ay; is it not a language I speak?,4
bloody succeeding. My master!,4
To any count to all counts to what is man.,4
another style.,4
I must tell thee sirrah I write man; to which,4
What I dare too well do I dare not do.,4
wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy,4
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from,4
have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care,4
that thou't scarce worth.,4
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou,4
for a hen! So my good window of lattice fare thee,4
through thee. Give me thy hand.,4
Ay with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.,4
Yes good faith every dram of it; and I will not,4
Well I shall be wiser.,4
a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound,4
to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold,4
that I may say in the default he is a man I know.,4
I would it were hell-pains for thy sake and my poor,4
thee in what motion age will give me leave.,4
Well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off,4
be patient; there is no fettering of authority.,4
any convenience an he were double and double a,4
would of--I'll beat him an if I could but meet him again.,4
Sirrah your lord and master's married; there's news,4
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make,4
lord: whom I serve above is my master.,4
Ay sir.,4
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of,4
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine,4
thee: methinks thou art a general offence and,4
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.,4
Go to sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a,4
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords,4
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not,4
Exit,4
let it be concealed awhile.,4
Undone and forfeited to cares for ever!,4
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,4
What what sweet-heart?,4
I'll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.,4
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!,4
I know not yet.,4
He wears his honour in a box unseen,4
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,4
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions,4
Therefore to the war!,4
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,4
That which I durst not speak; his present gift,4
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife,4
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?,4
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow,4
Why these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:,4
Therefore away and leave her bravely; go:,4
Exeunt,4

She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's,4

Truly she's very well indeed but for two things.,4
One that she's not in heaven whither God send her,4
God send her quickly!,4
Bless you my fortunate lady!,4
good fortunes.,4
on have them still. O my knave how does my old lady?,4
I would she did as you say.,4
Marry you are the wiser man; for many a man's,4
nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to have,4
is within a very little of nothing.,4
You should have said sir before a knave thou'rt a,4
been truth sir.,4
Did you find me in yourself sir? or were you,4
and much fool may you find in you even to the,4
A good knave i' faith and well fed.,4
A very serious business calls on him.,4
Which as your due time claims he does acknowledge;,4
Whose want and whose delay is strew'd with sweets,4
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy,4
What's his will else?,4
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,4
May make it probable need.,4
That having this obtain'd you presently,4
In every thing I wait upon his will.,4
I pray you.,4
Come sirrah.,4
SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.,4
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.,4
You have it from his own deliverance.,4
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.,4

transgressed against his valour; and my state that,4
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you make,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
Pray you sir who's his tailor?,4

[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?,4
Will she away to-night?,4
I have writ my letters casketed my treasure,4
When I should take possession of the bride,4
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a,4
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with should,4
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur?,4

question for your residence.,4
And shall do so ever though I took him at 's,4

Exit,4
I think so.,4
Yes I do know him well and common speech,4
Enter HELENA,4
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave,4
Some private speech with you.,4
You must not marvel Helen at my course,4
The ministration and required office,4
For such a business; therefore am I found,4
That presently you take our way for home;,4
For my respects are better than they seem,4
Greater than shows itself at the first view,4
Giving a letter,4
I leave you to your wisdom.,4
But that I am your most obedient servant.,4
And ever shall,4

that he comes not along with her.,4
melancholy man.,4
Why he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the,4
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of,4
Let me see what he writes and when he means to come.,4
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our,4
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:,4
love as an old man loves money with no stomach.,4
E'en that you have there.,4
[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath,4
her not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not',4
before the report come. If there be breadth enough,4
to you. Your unfortunate son,4
This is not well rash and unbridled boy.,4
To pluck his indignation on thy head,4
For the contempt of empire.,4
O madam yonder is heavy news within between two,4
What is the matter?,4
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I,4
Why should he be killed?,4
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of,4
they come will tell you more: for my part I only,4
Exit,4
Save you good madam.,4
Do not say so.,4
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,4
Can woman me unto't: where is my son I pray you?,4
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,4
Thither we bend again.,4
Reads,4
never shall come off and show me a child begotten,4
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.',4
Brought you this letter gentlemen?,4
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.,4
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,4
But I do wash his name out of my blood,4
Ay madam.,4
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,4
That good convenience claims.,4
Ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed.,4
Tis bitter.,4
Ay madam.,4
heart was not consenting to.,4
There's nothing here that is too good for him,4
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,4
A servant only and a gentleman,4
Parolles was it not?,4
A very tainted fellow and full of wickedness.,4
With his inducement.,4
The fellow has a deal of that too much,4
You're welcome gentlemen.,4
To tell him that his sword can never win,4
Written to bear along.,4
In that and all your worthiest affairs.,4
Will you draw near!,4
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.',4
Thou shalt have none Rousillon none in France;,4
That chase thee from thy country and expose,4
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I,4
Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark,4
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,4
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.,4
Whoever charges on his forward breast,4
And though I kill him not I am the cause,4
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd,4
That all the miseries which nature owes,4
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,4
My being here it is that holds thee hence:,4
The air of paradise did fan the house,4
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,4
For with the dark poor thief I'll steal away.,4
SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.,4
The general of our horse thou art; and we,4
Upon thy promising fortune.,4
A charge too heavy for my strength but yet,4
To the extreme edge of hazard.,4
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,4
This very day,4
Make me but like my thoughts and I shall prove,4
Exeunt,4
Enter COUNTESS and Steward,4
Might you not know she would do as she has done,4
[Reads],4
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,4
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.,4
My dearest master your dear son may hie:,4
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:,4
I his despiteful Juno sent him forth,4
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:,4
Whom I myself embrace to set him free.,4
Rinaldo you did never lack advice so much,4
I could have well diverted her intents,4
Pardon me madam:,4
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,4
What angel shall,4
Unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear,4
Of greatest justice. Write write Rinaldo,4
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth,4
Though little he do feel it set down sharply.,4
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,4
Hearing so much will speed her foot again,4
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense,4
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;,4
Exeunt,4
Enter an old Widow of Florence DIANA VIOLENTA and MARIANA with other Citizens,4
shall lose all the sight.,4
It is reported that he has taken their greatest,4
duke's brother.,4
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary,4
Come let's return again and suffice ourselves with,4
French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and,4
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited,4
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a,4
young earl. Beware of them Diana; their promises,4
lust are not the things they go under: many a maid,4
example that so terrible shows in the wreck of,4
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten,4
I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,4
modesty which is so lost.,4
I hope so.,4
Look here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at,4
question her. God save you pilgrim! whither are you bound?,4
Where do the palmers lodge I do beseech you?,4
Is this the way?,4
A march afar,4
If you will tarry holy pilgrim,4
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;,4
As ample as myself.,4
If you shall please so pilgrim.,4
You came I think from France?,4
Here you shall see a countryman of yours,4
His name I pray you.,4
But by the ear that hears most nobly of him:,4
Whatsome'er he is,4
As 'tis reported for the king had married him,4
Ay surely mere the truth: I know his lady.,4
Reports but coarsely of her.,4
Monsieur Parolles.,4
In argument of praise or to the worth,4
To have her name repeated: all her deserving,4
I have not heard examined.,4
Tis a hard bondage to become the wife,4
I warrant good creature wheresoe'er she is,4
A shrewd turn if she pleased.,4
May be the amorous count solicits her,4
He does indeed;,4
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:,4
In honestest defence.,4
So now they come:,4
Enter BERTRAM PAROLLES and the whole army,4
That Escalus.,4
He;,4
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester,4
I like him well.,4
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,4
Which is he?,4
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.,4
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look he has spied us.,4
And your courtesy for a ring-carrier!,4
The troop is past. Come pilgrim I will bring you,4
There's four or five to great Saint Jaques bound,4
I humbly thank you:,4
To eat with us to-night the charge and thanking,4
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,4
We'll take your offer kindly.,4
SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.,4
Nay good my lord put him to't; let him have his,4
If your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no,4
On my life my lord a bubble.,4
Believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge,4
kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and,4
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's,4
It were fit you knew him; lest reposing too far in,4
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.,4
None better than to let him fetch off his drum,4
I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly,4
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink,4
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when,4
present at his examination: if he do not for the,4
base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the,4
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never,4
O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum;,4
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to,4
melted if you give him not John Drum's,4
Here he comes.,4
[Aside to BERTRAM]  O for the love of laughter,4
off his drum in any hand.,4
disposition.,4
But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!,4
horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers!,4
service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar,4
there to command.,4
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is,4
It might have been recovered.,4
It is to be recovered: but that the merit of,4
performer I would have that drum or another or,4
Why if you have a stomach to't monsieur: if you,4
instrument of honour again into his native quarter,4
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you,4
and extend to you what further becomes his,4
worthiness.,4
But you must not now slumber in it.,4
pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my,4
and by midnight look to hear further from me.,4
I know not what the success will be my lord; but,4
I know thou'rt valiant; and to the possibility of,4
I love not many words.,4
No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a,4
to undertake this business which he knows is not to,4
damned than to do't?,4
is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and,4
when you find him out you have him ever after.,4
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?,4
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we,4
to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.,4
him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:,4
sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this,4
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.,4
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.,4
Now will I lead you to the house and show you,4
But you say she's honest.,4
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,4
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;,4
Will you go see her?,4
Exeunt,4
Enter HELENA and Widow,4
I know not how I shall assure you further,4
Though my estate be fallen I was well born,4
And would not put my reputation now,4
Nor would I wish you.,4
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken,4
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,4
I should believe you:,4
You're great in fortune.,4
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,4
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,4
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,4
Now his important blood will nought deny,4
That downward hath succeeded in his house,4
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds,4
To buy his will it would not seem too dear,4
Now I see,4
You see it lawful then: it is no more,4
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;,4
Herself most chastely absent: after this,4
To what is passed already.,4
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,4
May prove coherent. Every night he comes,4
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us,4
As if his life lay on't.,4
Let us assay our plot; which if it speed,4
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,4
But let's about it.,4
ACT IV,4
Enter Second French Lord with five or six other Soldiers in ambush,4
When you sally upon him speak what terrible,4
yourselves no matter; for we must not seem to,4
must produce for an interpreter.,4
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?,4
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?,4
He must think us some band of strangers i' the,4
all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every,4
speak one to another; so we seem to know is to,4
gabble enough and good enough. As for you,4
ho! here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep,4
Enter PAROLLES,4
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have,4
carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces,4
my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the,4
daring the reports of my tongue.,4
was guilty of.,4
recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the,4
must give myself some hurts and say I got them in,4
will say 'Came you off with so little?' and great,4
instance? Tongue I must put you into a,4
Bajazet's mule if you prattle me into these perils.,4
that he is?,4
turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword.,4
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in,4
Twould not do.,4
Hardly serve.,4
How deep?,4
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.,4
I recovered it.,4
A drum now of the enemy's--,4
Throca movousus cargo cargo cargo.,4
O ransom ransom! do not hide mine eyes.,4
Boskos thromuldo boskos.,4
And I shall lose my life for want of language;,4
Italian or French let him speak to me; I'll,4
Boskos vauvado: I understand thee and can speak,4
faith for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.,4
O pray pray pray! Manka revania dulche.,4
The general is content to spare thee yet;,4
To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform,4
O let me live!,4
Their force their purposes; nay I'll speak that,4
But wilt thou faithfully?,4
Acordo linta.,4
Exit with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within,4
We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled,4
Captain I will.,4
Inform on that.,4
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.,4
SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.,4
They told me that your name was Fontibell.,4
Titled goddess;,4
In your fine frame hath love no quality?,4
You are no maiden but a monument:,4
As you are now for you are cold and stem;,4
When your sweet self was got.,4
So should you be.,4
My mother did but duty; such my lord,4
No more o' that;,4
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee,4
Do thee all rights of service.,4
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,4
And mock us with our bareness.,4
Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,4
What is not holy that we swear not by,4
If I should swear by God's great attributes,4
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,4
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths,4
At least in my opinion.,4
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;,4
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,4
Who then recover: say thou art mine and ever,4
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre,4
I'll lend it thee my dear; but have no power,4
Will you not my lord?,4
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;,4
In me to lose.,4
My chastity's the jewel of our house,4
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world,4
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,4
Here take my ring:,4
And I'll be bid by thee.,4
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.,4
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,4
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them,4
And on your finger in the night I'll put,4
May token to the future our past deeds.,4
A wife of me though there my hope be done.,4
Exit,4
You may so in the end.,4
As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men,4
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him,4
Marry that will I live and die a maid:,4
To cozen him that would unjustly win.,4
SCENE III. The Florentine camp.,4
You have not given him his mother's letter?,4
something in't that stings his nature; for on the,4
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking,4
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting,4
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a,4
When you have spoken it 'tis dead and I am the,4
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in,4
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath,4
made in the unchaste composition.,4
what things are we!,4
of all treasons we still see them reveal,4
so he that in this action contrives against his own,4
Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of,4
company to-night?,4
That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see,4
of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had,4
We will not meddle with him till he come; for his,4
In the mean time what hear you of these wars?,4
Nay I assure you a peace concluded.,4
higher or return again into France?,4
of his council.,4
of his act.,4

sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing the,4
grief; in fine made a groan of her last breath and,4
How is this justified?,4
makes her story true even to the point of her,4
office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by,4
Hath the count all this intelligence?,4
point so to the full arming of the verity.,4
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!,4
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath,4
with a shame as ample.,4
ill together: our virtues would be proud if our,4
despair if they were not cherished by our virtues.,4
How now! where's your master?,4
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next,4
letters of commendations to the king.,4
were more than they can commend.,4
Here's his lordship now.,4
How now my lord! is't not after midnight?,4
month's length a-piece by an abstract of success:,4
nearest; buried a wife mourned for her; writ to my,4
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected,4
that I have not ended yet.,4
morning your departure hence it requires haste of,4
I mean the business is not ended as fearing to,4
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,4
me like a double-meaning prophesier.,4
poor gallant knave.,4
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?,4
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;,4
hath confessed himself to Morgan whom he supposes,4
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the,4
Nothing of me has a'?,4
face: if your lordship be in't as I believe you,4
Enter PAROLLES guarded and First Soldier,4
me: hush hush!,4
He calls for the tortures: what will you say,4
I will confess what I know without constraint: if,4
Bosko chimurcho.,4
You are a merciful general. Our general bids you,4
And truly as I hope to live.,4
duke is strong.' What say you to that?,4
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered and,4
and credit and as I hope to live.,4
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will.,4
You're deceived my lord: this is Monsieur,4
phrase--that had the whole theoric of war in the,4
his dagger.,4
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him,4
Well that's set down.,4
true--or thereabouts set down for I'll speak truth.,4
But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he,4
Poor rogues I pray you say.,4
I humbly thank you sir: a truth's a truth the,4
[Reads]  'Demand of him of what strength they are,4
By my troth sir if I were to live this present,4
hundred and fifty; Sebastian so many; Corambus so,4

I beseech you let me answer to the particular of,4
Do you know this Captain Dumain?,4
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's,4
say him nay.,4
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.,4
Upon my knowledge he is and lousy.,4
lordship anon.,4
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer,4
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.,4
In good sadness I do not know; either it is there,4
in my tent.,4
I do not know if it be it or no.,4
Excellently.,4
That is not the duke's letter sir; that is an,4
Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count,4
ruttish: I pray you sir put it up again.,4
My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the,4
a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to,4
Damnable both-sides rogue!,4
After he scores he never pays the score:,4
He ne'er pays after-debts take it before;,4
Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss:,4
Who pays before but not when he does owe it.,4

linguist and the armipotent soldier.,4
he's a cat to me.,4
fain to hang you.,4

sir in a dungeon i' the stocks or any where so I may live.,4
therefore once more to this Captain Dumain: you,4
his valour: what is his honesty?,4
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he,4
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie sir with,4
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue for he will,4
harm save to his bed-clothes about him; but they,4
little more to say sir of his honesty: he has,4
an honest man should have he has nothing.,4
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon,4
What say you to his expertness in war?,4
tragedians; to belie him I will not and more of,4
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there,4
files: I would do the man what honour I can but of,4
He hath out-villained villany so far that the,4
A pox on him he's a cat still.,4
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.,4
of his salvation the inheritance of it; and cut the,4
succession for it perpetually.,4
Why does be ask him of me?,4
E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so,4
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,4
in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry in coming,4
If your life be saved will you undertake to betray,4
Ay and the captain of his horse Count Rousillon.,4
[Aside]  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all,4
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy,4
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?,4
general says you that have so traitorously,4
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can,4

That shall you and take your leave of all your friends.,4
So look about you: know you any here?,4
God bless you Captain Parolles.,4
Captain what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?,4
Good captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet,4

Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords,4

If you could find out a country where but women were,4
impudent nation. Fare ye well sir; I am for France,4
Exit with Soldiers,4
Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;,4
As captain shall: simply the thing I am,4
Let him fear this for it will come to pass,4
Rust sword? cool blushes! and Parolles live,4
There's place and means for every man alive.,4
Exit,4
Enter HELENA Widow and DIANA,4
One of the greatest in the Christian world,4
Ere I can perfect mine intents to kneel:,4
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude,4
And answer thanks: I duly am inform'd,4
We have convenient convoy. You must know,4
My husband hies him home; where heaven aiding,4
We'll be before our welcome.,4
You never had a servant to whose trust,4
Nor you mistress,4
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven,4
As it hath fated her to be my motive,4
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,4
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play,4
But more of this hereafter. You Diana,4
Something in my behalf.,4
Go with your impositions I am yours,4
Yet I pray you:,4
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,4
Our wagon is prepared and time revives us:,4
Whate'er the course the end is the renown.,4
SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,4
No no no your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta,4
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in,4
this hour and your son here at home more advanced,4
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the,4
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my,4
could not have owed her a more rooted love.,4
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.,4
salad or rather the herb of grace.,4
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar sir; I have not much,4
Whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a fool?,4
Your distinction?,4
So you were a knave at his service indeed.,4
I will subscribe for thee thou art both knave and fool.,4
No no no.,4
great a prince as you are.,4
Faith sir a' has an English name; but his fisnomy,4
What prince is that?,4
darkness; alias the devil.,4
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;,4
I am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a,4
good fire. But sure he is the prince of the,4
the house with the narrow gate which I take to be,4

leads to the broad gate and the great fire.,4
tell thee so before because I would not fall out,4

jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.,4
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.,4
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,4
indeed he has no pace but runs where he will.,4
tell you since I heard of the good lady's death and,4
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of,4
his majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did,4

velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a,4
A scar nobly got or a noble scar is a good livery,4
But it is your carbonadoed face.,4

hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head,4
Exeunt,4
SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.,4
But this exceeding posting day and night,4
But since you have made the days and nights as one,4
Be bold you do so grow in my requital,4
Enter a Gentleman,4
If he would spend his power. God save you sir.,4
Sir I have seen you in the court of France.,4
I do presume sir that you are not fallen,4
An therefore goaded with most sharp occasions,4
The use of your own virtues for the which,4
What's your will?,4
To give this poor petition to the king,4
To come into his presence.,4
Not here sir!,4
He hence removed last night and with more haste,4
Lord how we lose our pains!,4
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.,4
Marry as I take it to Rousillon;,4
I do beseech you sir,4
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,4
But rather make you thank your pains for it.,4
Our means will make us means.,4
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,4
Go go provide.,4
SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.,4
Good Monsieur Lavache give my Lord Lafeu this,4
you when I have held familiarity with fresher,4
mood and smell somewhat strong of her strong,4
Truly fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it,4
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.,4
Nay you need not to stop your nose sir; I spake,4
Indeed sir if your metaphor stink I will stop my,4
thee further.,4
Foh! prithee stand away: a paper from fortune's,4
comes himself.,4
Here is a purr of fortune's sir or of fortune's,4
unclean fishpond of her displeasure and as he,4
carp as you may; for he looks like a poor decayed,4
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to,4
Exit,4
scratched.,4
pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the,4

I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.,4
save your word.,4
You beg more than 'word' then. Cox my passion!,4
O my good lord you were the first that found me!,4
It lies in you my lord to bring me in some grace,4
Out upon thee knave! dost thou put upon me at once,4
thee in grace and the other brings thee out.,4
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,4
night: though you are a fool and a knave you shall,4
I praise God for you.,4
SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,4
We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem,4
As mad in folly lack'd the sense to know,4
Tis past my liege;,4
Natural rebellion done i' the blaze of youth;,4
O'erbears it and burns on.,4
I have forgiven and forgotten all;,4
And watch'd the time to shoot.,4
But first I beg my pardon the young lord,4
Offence of mighty note; but to himself,4
Whose beauty did astonish the survey,4
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve,4
Praising what is lost,4
We are reconciled and the first view shall kill,4
The nature of his great offence is dead,4
The incensing relics of it: let him approach,4
So 'tis our will he should.,4
Exit,4
All that he is hath reference to your highness.,4
That set him high in fame.,4
He looks well on't.,4
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail,4
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;,4
My high-repented blames,4
All is whole;,4
Let's take the instant by the forward top;,4
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time,4
The daughter of this lord?,4
I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart,4
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,4
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;,4
Extended or contracted all proportions,4
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,4
The dust that did offend it.,4
That thou didst love her strikes some scores away,4
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,4
Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults,4
Not knowing them until we know their grave:,4
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust,4
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.,4
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:,4
To see our widower's second marriage-day.,4
Or ere they meet in me O nature cesse!,4
Must be digested give a favour from you,4
That she may quickly come.,4
By my old beard,4
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,4
I saw upon her finger.,4
Now pray you let me see it; for mine eye,4
This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen,4
Necessitied to help that by this token,4
her,4
My gracious sovereign,4
The ring was never hers.,4
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it,4
I am sure I saw her wear it.,4
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,4
Of her that threw it: noble she was and thought,4
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully,4
As she had made the overture she ceased,4
Receive the ring again.,4
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,4
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine 'twas Helen's,4
That you are well acquainted with yourself,4
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety,4
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,4
Upon her great disaster.,4
Thou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honour;,4
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove,4
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,4
Her eyes myself could win me to believe,4
Guards seize BERTRAM,4
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,4
We'll sift this matter further.,4
This ring was ever hers you shall as easy,4
Where yet she never was.,4
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.,4
Gracious sovereign,4
Here's a petition from a Florentine,4
To tender it herself. I undertook it,4
Of the poor suppliant who by this I know,4
With an importing visage; and she told me,4
Your highness with herself.,4
when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won,4
are forfeited to me and my honour's paid to him. He,4
him to his country for justice: grant it me O,4
flourishes and a poor maid is undone.,4
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair and toll for,4
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,4
Go speedily and bring again the count.,4
Was foully snatch'd.,4
Re-enter BERTRAM guarded,4
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,4
Enter Widow and DIANA,4
I am my lord a wretched Florentine,4
My suit as I do understand you know,4
I am her mother sir whose age and honour,4
And both shall cease without your remedy.,4
My lord I neither can nor will deny,4
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?,4
If you shall marry,4
You give away heaven's vows and those are mine;,4
For I by vow am so embodied yours,4
Either both or none.,4
are no husband for her.,4
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness,4
Than for to think that I would sink it here.,4
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour,4
Good my lord,4
He had not my virginity.,4
She's impudent my lord,4
He does me wrong my lord; if I were so,4
Do not believe him. O behold this ring,4
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that,4
If I be one.,4
Of six preceding ancestors that gem,4
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;,4
Methought you said,4
I did my lord but loath am to produce,4
I saw the man to-day if man he be.,4
Exit an Attendant,4
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,4
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.,4
That will speak any thing?,4
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,4
She knew her distance and did angle for me,4
As all impediments in fancy's course,4
Her infinite cunning with her modern grace,4
And I had that which any inferior might,4
I must be patient:,4
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;,4
Send for your ring I will return it home,4
I have it not.,4
Sir much like,4
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.,4
The story then goes false you threw it him,4
I have spoke the truth.,4
My lord I do confess the ring was hers.,4
Is this the man you speak of?,4
Tell me sirrah but tell me true I charge you,4
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,4
So please your majesty my master hath been an,4
which gentlemen have.,4
Faith sir he did love her; but how?,4
He did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman.,4
He loved her sir and loved her not.,4
equivocal companion is this!,4
He's a good drum my lord but a naughty orator.,4
Faith I know more than I'll speak.,4
Yes so please your majesty. I did go between them,4
indeed he was mad for her and talked of Satan and,4
was in that credit with them at that time that I,4
as promising her marriage and things which would,4
speak what I know.,4
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy,4
This ring you say was yours?,4
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?,4
Who lent it you?,4
Where did you find it then?,4
If it were yours by none of all these ways,4
I never gave it him.,4
and on at pleasure.,4
It might be yours or hers for aught I know.,4
To prison with her: and away with him.,4
Thou diest within this hour.,4
Take her away.,4
I think thee now some common customer.,4
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?,4
He knows I am no maid and he'll swear to't;,4
Great king I am no strumpet by my life;,4
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.,4
Exit Widow,4
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,4
Though yet he never harm'd me here I quit him:,4
And at that time he got his wife with child:,4
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:,4
Re-enter Widow with HELENA,4
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?,4
No my good lord;,4
The name and not the thing.,4
O my good lord when I was like this maid,4
And look you here's your letter; this it says:,4
And are by me with child'  and c. This is done:,4
If she my liege can make me know this clearly,4
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,4
O my dear mother do I see you living?,4
To PAROLLES,4
I thank thee: wait on me home I'll make sport with thee:,4
Let us from point to point this story know,4
To DIANA,4
Choose thou thy husband and I'll pay thy dower;,4
Thou keep'st a wife herself thyself a maid.,4
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:,4
The bitter past more welcome is the sweet.,4
EPILOGUE,4
All is well ended if this suit be won,4
With strife to please you day exceeding day:,4
Your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts.,4
ACT I,5
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM,5
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,5
blessing to breed me well: and there begins my,5
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,5
properly stays me here at home unkept; for call you,5
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses,5
with their feeding they are taught their manage,5
brother gain nothing under him but growth; for the,5
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so,5
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets,5
brother and as much as in him lies mines my,5
grieves me; and the spirit of my father which I,5
servitude: I will no longer endure it though yet I,5
Yonder comes my master your brother.,5
shake me up.,5
Now sir! what make you here?,5
What mar you then sir?,5
made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness.,5
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?,5
come to such penury?,5
O sir very well; here in your orchard.,5
Ay better than him I am before knows me. I know,5
condition of blood you should so know me. The,5
you are the first-born; but the same tradition,5
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as,5
nearer to his reverence.,5
Come come elder brother you are too young in this.,5
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir,5
a villain that says such a father begot villains.,5
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy,5
Sweet masters be patient: for your father's,5
Let me go I say.,5
father charged you in his will to give me good,5
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like,5
me and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow,5
give me the poor allottery my father left me by,5
And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?,5
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I,5
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.,5
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true I have lost my,5
he would not have spoke such a word.,5
Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will,5
crowns neither. Holla Dennis!,5
Calls your worship?,5
So please you he is here at the door and importunes,5
Call him in.,5
Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.,5
Good morrow to your worship.,5
new court?,5
that is the old duke is banished by his younger,5
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,5
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.,5
banished with her father?,5
her being ever from their cradles bred together,5
to stay behind her. She is at the court and no,5
never two ladies loved as they do.,5
They say he is already in the forest of Arden and,5
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young,5
carelessly as they did in the golden world.,5
Marry do I sir; and I came to acquaint you with a,5
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition,5
To-morrow sir I wrestle for my credit; and he that,5
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,5
must for my own honour if he come in: therefore,5
withal that either you might stay him from his,5
run into in that it is a thing of his own search,5
Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which,5
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and,5
it but he is resolute. I'll tell thee Charles:,5
of ambition an envious emulator of every man's,5
me his natural brother: therefore use thy,5
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if,5
mightily grace himself on thee he will practise,5
treacherous device and never leave thee till he,5
for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak,5
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but,5
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.,5
to-morrow I'll give him his payment: if ever he go,5
so God keep your worship!,5
Exit CHARLES,5
an end of him; for my soul yet I know not why,5
schooled and yet learned full of noble device of,5
in the heart of the world and especially of my own,5
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this,5
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.,5
SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.,5
I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry.,5
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could,5
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.,5
that I love thee. If my uncle thy banished father,5
hadst been still with me I could have taught my,5
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously,5
Well I will forget the condition of my estate to,5
You know my father hath no child but I nor none is,5
be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy,5
affection; by mine honour I will; and when I break,5
sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry.,5
me see; what think you of falling in love?,5
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport,5
in honour come off again.,5
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from,5
I would we could do so for her benefits are,5
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.,5
makes honest and those that she makes honest she,5
Nay now thou goest from Fortune's office to,5
not in the lineaments of Nature.,5
No? when Nature hath made a fair creature may she,5
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not,5
Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when,5
Nature's wit.,5
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull,5
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of,5
wit! whither wander you?,5
Were you made the messenger?,5
Where learned you that oath fool?,5
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the,5
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and,5
How prove you that in the great heap of your,5
Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom.,5
swear by your beards that I am a knave.,5
By my knavery if I had it then I were; but if you,5
more was this knight swearing by his honour for he,5
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.,5
One that old Frederick your father loves.,5
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation,5
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what,5
By my troth thou sayest true; for since the little,5
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes,5
With his mouth full of news.,5
Then shall we be news-crammed.,5
Enter LE BEAU,5
Fair princess you have lost much good sport.,5
What colour madam! how shall I answer you?,5
Or as the Destinies decree.,5
Nay if I keep not my rank--,5
You amaze me ladies: I would have told you of good,5
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.,5
your ladyships you may see the end; for the best is,5
to perform it.,5
There comes an old man and his three sons--,5
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.,5
by these presents.',5
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him,5
hope of life in him: so he served the second and,5
their father making such pitiful dole over them,5
Alas!,5
have lost?,5
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first,5
for ladies.,5
But is there any else longs to see this broken music,5
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling cousin?,5
appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to,5
Yonder sure they are coming: let us now stay and see it.,5
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated his,5
Is yonder the man?,5
Alas he is too young! yet he looks successfully.,5
to see the wrestling?,5
You will take little delight in it I can tell you;,5
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him but he,5
you can move him.,5
Do so: I'll not be by.,5
I attend them with all respect and duty.,5
No fair princess; he is the general challenger: I,5
strength of my youth.,5
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's,5
knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your,5
enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to,5
Do young sir; your reputation shall not therefore,5
that the wrestling might not go forward.,5
thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty to deny,5
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my,5
shamed that was never gracious; if killed but one,5
friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the,5
the world I fill up a place which may be better,5
The little strength that I have I would it were with you.,5
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!,5
Come where is this young gallant that is so,5
Ready sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.,5
No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him,5
from a first.,5
mocked me before: but come your ways.,5
I would I were invisible to catch the strong,5
They wrestle,5
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who,5
Shout. CHARLES is thrown,5
Yes I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.,5
He cannot speak my lord.,5
Orlando my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.,5
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,5
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,5
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:,5
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK train and LE BEAU,5
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,5
To be adopted heir to Frederick.,5
And all the world was of my father's mind:,5
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,5
Gentle cousin,5
My father's rough and envious disposition,5
If you do keep your promises in love,5
Your mistress shall be happy.,5
Giving him a chain from her neck,5
That could give more but that her hand lacks means.,5
Ay. Fare you well fair gentleman.,5
Are all thrown down and that which here stands up,5
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;,5
Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown,5
Will you go coz?,5
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA,5
I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference.,5
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.,5
Good sir I do in friendship counsel you,5
High commendation true applause and love,5
That he misconstrues all that you have done.,5
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.,5
Which of the two was daughter of the duke,5
Neither his daughter if we judge by manners;,5
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,5
To keep his daughter company; whose loves,5
But I can tell you that of late this duke,5
Grounded upon no other argument,5
And pity her for her good father's sake;,5
Will suddenly break forth. Sir fare you well:,5
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.,5
Exit LE BEAU,5
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:,5
Exit,5
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND,5
Not one to throw at a dog.,5
curs; throw some of them at me; come lame me with reasons.,5
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad,5
But is all this for your father?,5
full of briers is this working-day world!,5
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden,5
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.,5
I would try if I could cry 'hem' and have him.,5
O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!,5
despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of,5
possible on such a sudden you should fall into so,5
The duke my father loved his father dearly.,5
dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,5
not Orlando.,5
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?,5
because I do. Look here comes the duke.,5
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords,5
And get you from our court.,5
You cousin,5
So near our public court as twenty miles,5
I do beseech your grace,5
If with myself I hold intelligence,5
If that I do not dream or be not frantic--,5
Never so much as in a thought unborn,5
Thus do all traitors:,5
They are as innocent as grace itself:,5
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:,5
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.,5
So was I when your highness banish'd him:,5
Or if we did derive it from our friends,5
Then good my liege mistake me not so much,5
Dear sovereign hear me speak.,5
Else had she with her father ranged along.,5
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:,5
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,5
Rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together,5
Still we went coupled and inseparable.,5
Her very silence and her patience,5
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;,5
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:,5
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.,5
I cannot live out of her company.,5
If you outstay the time upon mine honour,5
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords,5
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.,5
I have more cause.,5
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not the duke,5
That he hath not.,5
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:,5
No: let my father seek another heir.,5
Whither to go and what to bear with us;,5
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;,5
Say what thou canst I'll go along with thee.,5
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.,5
Maids as we are to travel forth so far!,5
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,5
The like do you: so shall we pass along,5
Were it not better,5
That I did suit me all points like a man?,5
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart,5
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,5
That do outface it with their semblances.,5
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;,5
But what will you be call'd?,5
No longer Celia but Aliena.,5
The clownish fool out of your father's court?,5
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;,5
And get our jewels and our wealth together,5
To hide us from pursuit that will be made,5
To liberty and not to banishment.,5
ACT II,5
Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three Lords like foresters,5
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet,5
More free from peril than the envious court?,5
The seasons' difference as the icy fang,5
Which when it bites and blows upon my body,5
This is no flattery: these are counsellors,5
Sweet are the uses of adversity,5
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;,5
Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks,5
I would not change it.,5
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune,5
Come shall we go and kill us venison?,5
Being native burghers of this desert city,5
Have their round haunches gored.,5
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,5
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.,5
Did steal behind him as he lay along,5
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:,5
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,5
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans,5
Almost to bursting and the big round tears,5
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,5
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,5
But what said Jaques?,5
O yes into a thousand similes.,5
Poor deer' quoth he 'thou makest a testament,5
To that which had too much:' then being there alone,5
'Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part,5
Full of the pasture jumps along by him,5
Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens;,5
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?',5
The body of the country city court,5
Are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse,5
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.,5
We did my lord weeping and commenting,5
Show me the place:,5
For then he's full of matter.,5
Exeunt,5
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords,5
It cannot be: some villains of my court,5
I cannot hear of any that did see her.,5
Saw her abed and in the morning early,5
My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft,5
Hisperia the princess' gentlewoman,5
Your daughter and her cousin much commend,5
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;,5
That youth is surely in their company.,5
If he be absent bring his brother to me;,5
And let not search and inquisition quail,5
Exeunt,5
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting,5
What my young master? O my gentle master!,5
Of old Sir Rowland! why what make you here?,5
And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?,5
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?,5
Know you not master to some kind of men,5
No more do yours: your virtues gentle master,5
O what a world is this when what is comely,5
Why what's the matter?,5
Come not within these doors; within this roof,5
Your brother--no no brother; yet the son--,5
Of him I was about to call his father--,5
To burn the lodging where you use to lie,5
He will have other means to cut you off.,5
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:,5
Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go?,5
What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?,5
A thievish living on the common road?,5
Yet this I will not do do how I can;,5
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.,5
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,5
When service should in my old limbs lie lame,5
Take that and He that doth the ravens feed,5
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;,5
Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty;,5
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,5
The means of weakness and debility;,5
Frosty but kindly: let me go with you;,5
In all your business and necessities.,5
The constant service of the antique world,5
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,5
And having that do choke their service up,5
But poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree,5
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry,5
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,5
Master go on and I will follow thee,5
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore,5
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;,5
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better,5
Exeunt,5
Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede CELIA for Aliena and TOUCHSTONE,5
I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary.,5
apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort,5
itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,5
I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.,5
you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,5
Well this is the forest of Arden.,5
at home I was in a better place: but travellers,5
Ay be so good Touchstone.,5
Look you who comes here; a young man and an old in,5
That is the way to make her scorn you still.,5
I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.,5
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover,5
But if thy love were ever like to mine--,5
How many actions most ridiculous,5
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.,5
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly,5
Thou hast not loved:,5
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,5
Or if thou hast not broke from company,5
Thou hast not loved.,5
Exit,5
I have by hard adventure found mine own.,5
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for,5
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her,5
wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took,5
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are,5
mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly.,5
Nay I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I,5
Jove Jove! this shepherd's passion,5
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.,5
If he for gold will give us any food:,5
Holla you clown!,5
Who calls?,5
Else are they very wretched.,5
And to you gentle sir and to you all.,5
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,5
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,5
Fair sir I pity her,5
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;,5
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:,5
And little recks to find the way to heaven,5
Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed,5
By reason of his absence there is nothing,5
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.,5
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,5
I pray thee if it stand with honesty,5
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.,5
And willingly could waste my time in it.,5
Go with me: if you like upon report,5
I will your very faithful feeder be,5
Exeunt,5
Enter AMIENS JAQUES and others,5
Under the greenwood tree,5
And turn his merry note,5
Come hither come hither come hither:,5
But winter and rough weather.,5
It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques.,5
melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.,5
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.,5
sing. Come more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?,5
Nay I care not for their names; they owe me,5
More at your request than to please myself.,5
but that they call compliment is like the encounter,5
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me,5
not hold your tongues.,5
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all,5
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is,5
matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no,5
SONG.,5
All together here,5
Seeking the food he eats,5
Come hither come hither come hither:,5
But winter and rough weather.,5
yesterday in despite of my invention.,5
Thus it goes:--,5
That any man turn ass,5
A stubborn will to please,5
Here shall he see,5
An if he will come to me.,5
Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a,5
rail against all the first-born of Egypt.,5
Exeunt severally,5
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM,5
Here lie I down and measure out my grave. Farewell,5
Why how now Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live,5
If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage I,5
thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.,5
the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;,5
give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I,5
thou lookest cheerly and I'll be with thee quickly.,5
thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for,5
desert. Cheerly good Adam!,5
SCENE VII. The forest.,5
I think he be transform'd into a beast;,5
My lord he is but even now gone hence:,5
If he compact of jars grow musical,5
Go seek him: tell him I would speak with him.,5
He saves my labour by his own approach.,5
That your poor friends must woo your company?,5
A fool a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,5
As I do live by food I met a fool,5
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,5
Good morrow fool' quoth I. 'No sir' quoth he,5
And then he drew a dial from his poke,5
Says very wisely 'It is ten o'clock:,5
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,5
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,5
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear,5
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,5
And I did laugh sans intermission,5
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.,5
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,5
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,5
After a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd,5
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!,5
Thou shalt have one.,5
Provided that you weed your better judgments,5
That I am wise. I must have liberty,5
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;,5
They most must laugh. And why sir must they so?,5
He that a fool doth very wisely hit,5
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,5
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.,5
To speak my mind and I will through and through,5
If they will patiently receive my medicine.,5
What for a counter would I do but good?,5
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,5
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,5
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.,5
That can therein tax any private party?,5
Till that the weary very means do ebb?,5
When that I say the city-woman bears,5
Who can come in and say that I mean her,5
Or what is he of basest function,5
Thinking that I mean him but therein suits,5
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein,5
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,5
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?,5
Forbear and eat no more.,5
Nor shalt not till necessity be served.,5
Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress,5
That in civility thou seem'st so empty?,5
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show,5
And know some nurture. But forbear I say:,5
Till I and my affairs are answered.,5
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force,5
I almost die for food; and let me have it.,5
Speak you so gently? Pardon me I pray you:,5
And therefore put I on the countenance,5
That in this desert inaccessible,5
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,5
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,5
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,5
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:,5
True is it that we have seen better days,5
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes,5
And therefore sit you down in gentleness,5
That to your wanting may be minister'd.,5
Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn,5
Who after me hath many a weary step,5
Oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger,5
Go find him out,5
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!,5
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:,5
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene,5
All the world's a stage,5
They have their exits and their entrances;,5
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,5
And then the whining school-boy with his satchel,5
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,5
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,5
Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel,5
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,5
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,5
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts,5
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,5
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,5
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,5
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,5
Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM,5
And let him feed.,5
So had you need:,5
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you,5
Give us some music; and good cousin sing.,5
Blow blow thou winter wind.,5
As man's ingratitude;,5
Because thou art not seen,5
Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly:,5
Then heigh-ho the holly!,5
Freeze freeze thou bitter sky,5
As benefits forgot:,5
Thy sting is not so sharp,5
Heigh-ho! sing  and c.,5
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,5
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,5
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,5
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.,5
And let me all your fortunes understand.,5
ACT III,5
Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords and OLIVER,5
But were I not the better part made mercy,5
Of my revenge thou present. But look to it:,5
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living,5
To seek a living in our territory.,5
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,5
Of what we think against thee.,5
I never loved my brother in my life.,5
And let my officers of such a nature,5
Do this expediently and turn him going.,5
SCENE II. The forest.,5
Hang there my verse in witness of my love:,5
With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above,5
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,5
That every eye which in this forest looks,5
Run run Orlando; carve on every tree,5
Exit,5
And how like you this shepherd's life Master Touchstone?,5
life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,5
like it very well; but in respect that it is,5
is in the fields it pleaseth me well; but in,5
is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well;,5
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd?,5
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,5
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to,5
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that,5
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.,5
court shepherd?,5
Then thou art damned.,5
Truly thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg all,5
For not being at court? Your reason.,5
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,5
sin and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous,5
Not a whit Touchstone: those that are good manners,5
behavior of the country is most mockable at the,5
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be,5
Instance briefly; come instance.,5
fells you know are greasy.,5
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of,5
Besides our hands are hard.,5
A more sounder instance come.,5
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The,5
Most shallow man! thou worms-meat in respect of a,5
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar the,5
You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.,5
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.,5
that I wear owe no man hate envy no man's,5
harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes,5
That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes,5
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a,5
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram,5
damned for this the devil himself will have no,5
scape.,5
Enter ROSALIND with a paper reading,5
No jewel is like Rosalind.,5
Through all the world bears Rosalind.,5
Are but black to Rosalind.,5
But the fair of Rosalind.,5
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the,5
Out fool!,5
If a hart do lack a hind,5
If the cat will after kind,5
Winter garments must be lined,5
They that reap must sheaf and bind;,5
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,5
He that sweetest rose will find,5
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you,5
Peace you dull fool! I found them on a tree.,5
I'll graff it with you and then I shall graff it,5
i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half,5
You have said; but whether wisely or no let the,5
Enter CELIA with a writing,5
[Reads],5
For it is unpeopled? No:,5
That shall civil sayings show:,5
Runs his erring pilgrimage,5
Buckles in his sum of age;,5
Twixt the souls of friend and friend:,5
Or at every sentence end,5
Teaching all that read to know,5
Heaven would in little show.,5
That one body should be fill'd,5
Nature presently distill'd,5
Cleopatra's majesty,5
Sad Lucretia's modesty.,5
By heavenly synod was devised,5
To have the touches dearest prized.,5
And I to live and die her slave.,5
have you wearied your parishioners withal and never,5
How now! back friends! Shepherd go off a little.,5
Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat;,5
Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE,5
O yes I heard them all and more too; for some of,5
That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.,5
themselves without the verse and therefore stood,5
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name,5
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder,5
palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since,5
can hardly remember.,5
Is it a man?,5
Change you colour?,5
O Lord Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to,5
and so encounter.,5
Is it possible?,5
tell me who it is.,5
wonderful! and yet again wonderful and after that,5
Good my complexion! dost thou think though I am,5
my disposition? One inch of delay more is a,5
quickly and speak apace. I would thou couldst,5
out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-,5
all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that,5
So you may put a man in your belly.,5
head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?,5
Why God will send more if the man will be,5
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.,5
heels and your heart both in an instant.,5
true maid.,5
Orlando?,5
Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and,5
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes,5
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see,5
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a,5
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to,5
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in,5
day he wrestled?,5
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my,5
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.,5
forth such fruit.,5
Proceed.,5
Though it be pity to see such a sight it well,5
Cry 'holla' to thy tongue I prithee; it curvets,5
O ominous! he comes to kill my heart.,5
me out of tune.,5
speak. Sweet say on.,5
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES,5
I thank you for your company; but good faith I had,5
And so had I; but yet for fashion sake I thank you,5
God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.,5
I pray you mar no more trees with writing,5
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading,5
Rosalind is your love's name?,5
I do not like her name.,5
christened.,5
Just as high as my heart.,5
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and conned them,5
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth from,5
You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of,5
we two will rail against our mistress the world and,5
I will chide no breather in the world but myself,5
The worst fault you have is to be in love.,5
I am weary of you.,5

Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.,5
Signior Love.,5
Melancholy.,5
[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him like a saucy,5
Do you hear forester?,5
I pray you what is't o'clock?,5
in the forest.,5
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would,5
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that,5
By no means sir: Time travels in divers paces with,5

Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of,5
Who ambles Time withal?,5
hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because,5
he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean,5
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.,5
With a thief to the gallows for though he go as,5
Who stays it still withal?,5
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.,5
With this shepherdess my sister; here in the,5
Are you native of this place?,5
Your accent is something finer than you could,5
I have been told so of many: but indeed an old,5
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship,5
him read many lectures against it and I thank God,5
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their,5
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he,5
There were none principal; they were all like one,5
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.,5
No I will not cast away my physic but on those that,5
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on,5
on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of,5
give him some good counsel for he seems to have the,5
I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me,5
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he,5
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.,5
A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and,5
spirit which you have not a beard neglected,5
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's,5
bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe,5
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you,5
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.,5
Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you,5
do than to confess she does: that is one of the,5
their consciences. But in good sooth are you he,5
is so admired?,5
Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he.,5
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.,5
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and,5
is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers,5
Did you ever cure any so?,5
his love his mistress; and I set him every day to,5
youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing,5
inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every,5
thing as boys and women are for the most part,5
him; then entertain him then forswear him; now weep,5
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of,5
the world and to live in a nook merely monastic.,5
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's,5
I would not be cured youth.,5
and come every day to my cote and woo me.,5
where it is.,5
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.,5
With all my heart good youth.,5
Exeunt,5
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind,5
goats Audrey. And how Audrey? am I the man yet?,5
Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!,5
capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths.,5
in a thatched house!,5
man's good wit seconded with the forward child,5
great reckoning in a little room. Truly I would,5
I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in,5
No truly; for the truest poetry is the most,5
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.,5
I do truly; for thou swearest to me thou art,5
hope thou didst feign.,5
No truly unless thou wert hard-favoured; for,5

Well praised be the gods for thy foulness!,5

Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart,5
but the wood no assembly but horn-beasts. But what,5
necessary. It is said 'many a man knows no end of,5
knows no end of them. Well that is the dowry of,5
Even so. Poor men alone? No no; the noblest deer,5
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more,5
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a,5

Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,5
dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go,5
Is there none here to give the woman?,5
Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful.,5
Proceed proceed I'll give her.,5
sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your,5
toy in hand here sir: nay pray be covered.,5
As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and,5
as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling.,5
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to,5
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you,5
prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp.,5
married of him than of another: for he is not like,5
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.,5
Come sweet Audrey:,5
Farewell good Master Oliver: not--,5
O brave Oliver,5
Wind away,5
I will not to wedding with thee.,5
Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them,5
Exit,5
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA,5
Do I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider,5
But have I not cause to weep?,5
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.,5
Judas's own children.,5
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.,5
of holy bread.,5
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;,5
But why did he swear he would come this morning and,5
Nay certainly there is no truth in him.,5
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a,5
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a,5
Not true in love?,5
You have heard him swear downright he was.,5
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are,5
here in the forest on the duke your father.,5
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told,5
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a,5
O that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,5
them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of,5
but on one side breaks his staff like a noble,5
guides. Who comes here?,5
Mistress and master you have oft inquired,5
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,5
That was his mistress.,5
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,5
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,5
If you will mark it.,5
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.,5
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.,5
SCENE V. Another part of the forest.,5
Sweet Phebe do not scorn me; do not Phebe;,5
In bitterness. The common executioner,5
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck,5
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?,5
I would not be thy executioner:,5
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:,5
That eyes that are the frail'st and softest things,5
Should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers!,5
And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee:,5
Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame,5
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:,5
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,5
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,5
Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes,5
O dear Phebe,5
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,5
That love's keen arrows make.,5
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,5
As till that time I shall not pity thee.,5
That you insult exult and all at once,5
As by my faith I see no more in you,5
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?,5
I see no more in you than in the ordinary,5
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!,5
Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair,5
That can entame my spirits to your worship.,5
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?,5
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you,5
Tis not her glass but you that flatters her;,5
Than any of her lineaments can show her.,5
And thank heaven fasting for a good man's love:,5
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:,5
Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer.,5
Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together:,5
He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll,5
she answers thee with frowning looks I'll sauce her,5
For no ill will I bear you.,5
For I am falser than vows made in wine:,5
Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.,5
Come sister. Shepherdess look on him better,5
None could be so abused in sight as he.,5
Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN,5
Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?',5
Ha what say'st thou Silvius?,5
Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius.,5
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,5
Were both extermined.,5
I would have you.,5
Silvius the time was that I hated thee,5
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,5
I will endure and I'll employ thee too:,5
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.,5
And I in such a poverty of grace,5
To glean the broken ears after the man,5
A scatter'd smile and that I'll live upon.,5
Not very well but I have met him oft;,5
That the old carlot once was master of.,5
Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;,5
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.,5
But sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him:,5
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue,5
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:,5
There was a pretty redness in his lip,5
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference,5
There be some women Silvius had they mark'd him,5
To fall in love with him; but for my part,5
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:,5
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:,5
I marvel why I answer'd not again:,5
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,5
Phebe with all my heart.,5
The matter's in my head and in my heart:,5
Go with me Silvius.,5
ACT IV,5
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES,5
with thee.,5
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.,5
fellows and betray themselves to every modern,5
Why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.,5
I have neither the scholar's melancholy which is,5
nor the courtier's which is proud nor the,5
which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor,5
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples,5
contemplation of my travels in which my often,5
A traveller! By my faith you have great reason to,5
other men's; then to have seen much and to have,5
Yes I have gained my experience.,5
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me,5

Nay then God be wi' you an you talk in blank verse.,5
Farewell Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and,5

My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise.,5
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but,5
affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid,5
him heart-whole.,5
Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight: I,5
Of a snail?,5
carries his house on his head; a better jointure,5
his destiny with him.,5
Why horns which such as you are fain to be,5
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.,5
And I am your Rosalind.,5
Rosalind of a better leer than you.,5
humour and like enough to consent. What would you,5
I would kiss before I spoke.,5
gravelled for lack of matter you might take,5
out they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God,5
How if the kiss be denied?,5
Who could be out being before his beloved mistress?,5
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.,5
Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit.,5
I take some joy to say you are because I would be,5
Well in her person I say I will not have you.,5
No faith die by attorney. The poor world is,5
there was not any man died in his own person,5
dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he,5
of love. Leander he would have lived many a fair,5
for a hot midsummer night; for good youth he went,5
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish,5
But these are all lies: men have died from time to,5
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,5
By this hand it will not kill a fly. But come now,5
disposition and ask me what you will. I will grant,5
Then love me Rosalind.,5
And wilt thou have me?,5
What sayest thou?,5
I hope so.,5
Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us.,5
Pray thee marry us.,5
You must begin 'Will you Orlando--',5
I will.,5
Why now; as fast as she can marry us.,5
I take thee Rosalind for wife.,5
thee Orlando for my husband: there's a girl goes,5
runs before her actions.,5
Now tell me how long you would have her after you,5
For ever and a day.,5
men are April when they woo December when they wed:,5
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous,5
more clamorous than a parrot against rain more,5
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing like Diana,5
disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen and,5
But will my Rosalind do so?,5
O but she is wise.,5
wiser the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's,5
twill out at the key-hole; stop that 'twill fly,5
A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say,5
Nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met,5
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?,5
never take her without her answer unless you take,5
make her fault her husband's occasion let her,5
it like a fool!,5
Alas! dear love I cannot lack thee two hours.,5
will be with thee again.,5
would prove: my friends told me as much and I,5
won me: 'tis but one cast away and so come,5
Ay sweet Rosalind.,5
me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,5
minute behind your hour I will think you the most,5
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that,5
unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep,5
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my,5
Well Time is the old justice that examines all such,5
Exit ORLANDO,5
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your,5
her own nest.,5

bottom like the bay of Portugal.,5
affection in it runs out.,5

And I'll sleep.,5
SCENE II. The forest.,5
Which is he that killed the deer?,5
Let's present him to the duke like a Roman,5
horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have,5
Yes sir.,5
make noise enough.,5
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?,5
Then sing him home;,5
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;,5
Thy father's father wore it,5
The horn the horn the lusty horn,5
Exeunt,5
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA,5
here much Orlando!,5
hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to,5
Enter SILVIUS,5
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:,5
By the stern brow and waspish action,5
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:,5
Patience herself would startle at this letter,5
She says I am not fair that I lack manners;,5
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!,5
Why writes she so to me? Well shepherd well,5
No I protest I know not the contents:,5
Come come you are a fool,5
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.,5
That her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands:,5
I say she never did invent this letter;,5
Sure it is hers.,5
A style for-challengers; why she defies me,5
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,5
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?,5
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.,5
Reads,5
That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?,5
Call you this railing?,5
Why thy godhead laid apart,5
Did you ever hear such railing?,5
That could do no vengeance to me.,5
If the scorn of your bright eyne,5
Alack in me what strange effect,5
Whiles you chid me I did love;,5
He that brings this love to thee,5
And by him seal up thy mind;,5
Will the faithful offer take,5
Or else by him my love deny,5
Call you this chiding?,5
Do you pity him? no he deserves no pity. Wilt,5
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to,5
love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to,5
thee; if she will not I will never have her unless,5
hence and not a word; for here comes more company.,5
Enter OLIVER,5
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands,5
West of this place down in the neighbour bottom:,5
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.,5
There's none within.,5
Then should I know you by description;,5
Of female favour and bestows himself,5
And browner than her brother.' Are not you,5
It is no boast being ask'd to say we are.,5
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind,5
I am: what must we understand by this?,5
What man I am and how and why and where,5
I pray you tell it.,5
He left a promise to return again,5
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,5
And mark what object did present itself:,5
And high top bald with dry antiquity,5
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck,5
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd,5
Seeing Orlando it unlink'd itself,5
Into a bush: under which bush's shade,5
Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch,5
The royal disposition of that beast,5
This seen Orlando did approach the man,5
O I have heard him speak of that same brother;,5
That lived amongst men.,5
For well I know he was unnatural.,5
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?,5
But kindness nobler ever than revenge,5
Made him give battle to the lioness,5
From miserable slumber I awaked.,5
Wast you he rescued?,5
Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame,5
So sweetly tastes being the thing I am.,5
By and by.,5
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,5
In brief he led me to the gentle duke,5
Committing me unto my brother's love;,5
There stripp'd himself and here upon his arm,5
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,5
Brief I recover'd him bound up his wound;,5
He sent me hither stranger as I am,5
His broken promise and to give this napkin,5
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.,5
Why how now Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!,5
There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!,5
I would I were at home.,5
I pray you will you take him by the arm?,5
man's heart.,5
think this was well counterfeited! I pray you tell,5
This was not counterfeit: there is too great,5
of earnest.,5
Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.,5
Come you look paler and paler: pray you draw,5
That will I for I must bear answer back,5
I shall devise something: but I pray you commend,5

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding:,5
Between the acres of the rye,5

This carol they began that hour,5

And therefore take the present time,5

You say if I bring in your Rosalind,5
That would I had I kingdoms to give with her.,5
That would I were I of all kingdoms king.,5
That will I should I die the hour after.,5
You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?,5
You say that you'll have Phebe if she will?,5

couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of,5
Salutation and greeting to you all!,5
motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in,5
If any man doubt that let him put me to my,5
a lady; I have been politic with my friend smooth,5
had four quarrels and like to have fought one.,5
Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the,5
How seventh cause? Good my lord like this fellow.,5
God 'ild you sir; I desire you of the like. I,5
copulatives to swear and to forswear: according as,5
sir an ill-favoured thing sir but mine own; a poor,5
will: rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a,5

But for the seventh cause; how did you find the,5
Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more,5

mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.,5
would send me word he cut it to please himself:,5
not well cut' he disabled my judgment: this is,5
well cut' he would answer I spake not true: this,5
well cut' he would say I lied: this is called the,5
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.,5
I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,5
measured swords and parted.,5
O sir we quarrel in print by the book; as you have,5
The first the Retort Courteous; the second the,5
fourth the Reproof Valiant; the fifth the,5
Circumstance; the seventh the Lie Direct. All,5
avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven,5

To you I give myself for I am yours.,5
If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind.,5
Why then my love adieu!,5
I'll have no husband if you be not he:,5
Peace ho! I bar confusion:,5
Of these most strange events:,5
To join in Hymen's bands,5
You and you no cross shall part:,5
You to his love must accord,5
You and you are sure together,5
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,5
That reason wonder may diminish,5
SONG.,5
O blessed bond of board and bed!,5
High wedlock then be honoured:,5
To Hymen god of every town!,5
Even daughter welcome in no less degree.,5
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.,5
Let me have audience for a word or two:,5
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.,5
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,5
In his own conduct purposely to take,5
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;,5
After some question with him was converted,5
His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,5
That were with him exiled. This to be true,5
Welcome young man;,5
To one his lands withheld and to the other,5
First in this forest let us do those ends,5
And after every of this happy number,5
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,5
Meantime forget this new-fall'n dignity,5
Play music! And you brides and bridegrooms all,5
Sir by your patience. If I heard you rightly,5
And thrown into neglect the pompous court?,5
To him will I : out of these convertites,5
To DUKE SENIOR,5
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:,5
You to a love that your true faith doth merit:,5
You to your land and love and great allies:,5
You to a long and well-deserved bed:,5
And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage,5
I am for other than for dancing measures.,5
To see no pastime I what you would have,5
Exit,5
As we do trust they'll end in true delights.,5
EPILOGUE,5
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord,5
no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no,5
and good plays prove the better by the help of good,5
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with,5
furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not,5

please you: and I charge you O men for the love,5
none of you hates them--that between you and the,5
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased,5
defied not: and I am sure as many as have good,5
kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell.,5
ACT I,6
Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO,6
O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,6
Have glow'd like plated Mars now bend now turn,6
Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,6
The buckles on his breast reneges all temper,6
To cool a gipsy's lust.,6
Look where they come:,6
The triple pillar of the world transform'd,6
If it be love indeed tell me how much.,6
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.,6
Enter an Attendant,6
Grates me: the sum.,6
Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows,6
His powerful mandate to you 'Do this or this;,6
Perform 't or else we damn thee.',6
Perchance! nay and most like:,6
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it Antony.,6
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,6
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame,6
Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch,6
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike,6
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair,6
And such a twain can do't in which I bind,6
We stand up peerless.,6
Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?,6
Will be himself.,6
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,6
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch,6
Hear the ambassadors.,6
Whom every thing becomes to chide to laugh,6
To make itself in thee fair and admired!,6
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note,6
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.,6
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?,6
He comes too short of that great property,6
I am full sorry,6
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CHARMIAN IRAS ALEXAS and a Soothsayer,6
almost most absolute Alexas where's the soothsayer,6

A little I can read.,6
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
Cleopatra's health to drink.,6
I make not but foresee.,6
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.,6
No you shall paint when you are old.,6
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.,6
You shall be more beloving than beloved.,6
Nay hear him.,6
to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all:,6
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius,6
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.,6
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune,6
Then belike my children shall have no names:,6
If every of your wishes had a womb.,6
Out fool! I forgive thee for a witch.,6
Nay come tell Iras hers.,6
Mine and most of our fortunes to-night shall,6
There's a palm presages chastity if nothing else.,6
Go you wild bedfellow you cannot soothsay.,6
prognostication I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,6
Your fortunes are alike.,6
I have said.,6
Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than,6
Not in my husband's nose.,6
his fortune his fortune! O let him marry a woman,6
her die too and give him a worse! and let worst,6
laughing to his grave fifty-fold a cuckold! Good,6
matter of more weight; good Isis I beseech thee!,6
for as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man,6
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore dear Isis keep,6
Amen.,6
cuckold they would make themselves whores but,6
Hush! here comes Antony.,6
Enter CLEOPATRA,6
No lady.,6
No madam.,6
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!,6
Seek him and bring him hither.,6
Here at your service. My lord approaches.,6
Exeunt,6
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.,6
Ay:,6
Made friends of them joining their force 'gainst Caesar;,6
Upon the first encounter drave them.,6
The nature of bad news infects the teller.,6
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:,6
I hear him as he flatter'd.,6
This is stiff news--hath with his Parthian force,6
His conquering banner shook from Syria,6
Antony thou wouldst say--,6
Speak to me home mince not the general tongue:,6
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults,6
Have power to utter. O then we bring forth weeds,6
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.,6
Exit,6
The man from Sicyon--is there such an one?,6
Let him appear.,6
Or lose myself in dotage.,6
What are you?,6
Where died she?,6
Her length of sickness with what else more serious,6
Gives a letter,6
Exit Second Messenger,6
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,6
By revolution lowering does become,6
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.,6
Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know,6
Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
I must with haste from hence.,6
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;,6
I must be gone.,6
pity to cast them away for nothing; though between,6
nothing. Cleopatra catching but the least noise of,6
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is,6
her she hath such a celerity in dying.,6
Exit ALEXAS,6
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her,6
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this,6
shower of rain as well as Jove.,6
O sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece,6
have discredited your travel.,6
Sir?,6
Fulvia!,6
Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When,6
from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth;,6
out there are members to make new. If there were,6
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned,6
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion,6
The business she hath broached in the state,6
And the business you have broached here cannot be,6
wholly depends on your abode.,6
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break,6
And get her leave to part. For not alone,6
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too,6
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius,6
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,6
Till his deserts are past begin to throw,6
Upon his son; who high in name and power,6
For the main soldier: whose quality going on,6
Which like the courser's hair hath yet but life,6
To such whose place is under us requires,6
I shall do't.,6
SCENE III. The same. Another room.,6
Where is he?,6
See where he is who's with him what he does:,6
Say I am dancing; if in mirth report,6
Exit ALEXAS,6
You do not hold the method to enforce,6
What should I do I do not?,6
Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.,6
In time we hate that which we often fear.,6
Enter MARK ANTONY,6
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose--,6
It cannot be thus long the sides of nature,6
Now my dearest queen--,6
What's the matter?,6
What says the married woman? You may go:,6
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:,6
The gods best know--,6
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first,6
Cleopatra--,6
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,6
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,6
Most sweet queen--,6
But bid farewell and go: when you sued staying,6
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,6
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,6
Art turn'd the greatest liar.,6
I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know,6
Hear me queen:,6
Our services awhile; but my full heart,6
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius,6
Equality of two domestic powers,6
Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,6
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived,6
And quietness grown sick of rest would purge,6
And that which most with you should safe my going,6
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,6
She's dead my queen:,6
The garboils she awaked; at the last best:,6
O most false love!,6
With sorrowful water? Now I see I see,6
Quarrel no more but be prepared to know,6
As you shall give the advice. By the fire,6
Thy soldier servant; making peace or war,6
Cut my lace Charmian come;,6
So Antony loves.,6
And give true evidence to his love which stands,6
So Fulvia told me.,6
Then bid adieu to me and say the tears,6
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look,6
You'll heat my blood: no more.,6
Now by my sword--,6
But this is not the best. Look prithee Charmian,6
The carriage of his chafe.,6
Courteous lord one word.,6
Sir you and I have loved but there's not it;,6
O my oblivion is a very Antony,6
But that your royalty,6
For idleness itself.,6
To bear such idleness so near the heart,6
Since my becomings kill me when they do not,6
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.,6
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success,6
Let us go. Come;,6
That thou residing here go'st yet with me,6
Exeunt,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter LEPIDUS and their Train,6
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate,6
This is the news: he fishes drinks and wastes,6
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy,6
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there,6
That all men follow.,6
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:,6
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,6
Than what he chooses.,6
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;,6
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;,6
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this,6
As his composure must be rare indeed,6
No way excuse his soils when we do bear,6
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,6
Call on him for't: but to confound such time,6
As his own state and ours--'tis to be chid,6
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,6
Enter a Messenger,6
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,6
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;,6
That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports,6
Give him much wrong'd.,6
It hath been taught us from the primal state,6
And the ebb'd man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,6
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,6
To rot itself with motion.,6
Menecrates and Menas famous pirates,6
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads,6
Lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt:,6
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more,6
Antony,6
Wast beaten from Modena where thou slew'st,6
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,6
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink,6
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign,6
Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,6
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,6
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--,6
So much as lank'd not.,6
Let his shames quickly,6
Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end,6
Thrives in our idleness.,6
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly,6
To front this present time.,6
It is my business too. Farewell.,6
Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir,6
Doubt not sir;,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN,6
Madam?,6
Give me to drink mandragora.,6
That I might sleep out this great gap of time,6
You think of him too much.,6
Madam I trust not so.,6
What's your highness' pleasure?,6
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,6
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?,6
Indeed!,6
But what indeed is honest to be done:,6
What Venus did with Mars.,6
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?,6
O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony!,6
The demi-Atlas of this earth the arm,6
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?',6
With most delicious poison. Think on me,6
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,6
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey,6
There would he anchor his aspect and die,6
Enter ALEXAS from OCTAVIUS CAESAR,6
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!,6
With his tinct gilded thee.,6
Last thing he did dear queen,6
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.,6
Good friend' quoth he,6
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,6
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,6
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,6
Was beastly dumb'd by him.,6
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes,6
O well-divided disposition! Note him,6
He was not sad for he would shine on those,6
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay,6
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,6
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?,6
Why do you send so thick?,6
When I forget to send to Antony,6
Welcome my good Alexas. Did I Charmian,6
O that brave Caesar!,6
Say the brave Antony.,6
By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth,6
My man of men.,6
I sing but after you.,6
When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,6
Get me ink and paper:,6
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.,6
ACT II,6
Enter POMPEY MENECRATES and MENAS in warlike manner,6
The deeds of justest men.,6
That what they do delay they not deny.,6
The thing we sue for.,6
Beg often our own harms which the wise powers,6
By losing of our prayers.,6
The people love me and the sea is mine;,6
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony,6
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where,6
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,6
Caesar and Lepidus,6
Where have you this? 'tis false.,6
He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,6
Salt Cleopatra soften thy waned lip!,6
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,6
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;,6
Even till a Lethe'd dulness!,6
How now Varrius!,6
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome,6
A space for further travel.,6
A better ear. Menas I did not think,6
For such a petty war: his soldiership,6
The higher our opinion that our stirring,6
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.,6
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:,6
His brother warr'd upon him; although I think,6
I know not Menas,6
Were't not that we stand up against them all,6
themselves;,6
To draw their swords: but how the fear of us,6
The petty difference we yet not know.,6
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS,6
And shall become you well to entreat your captain,6
I shall entreat him,6
Let Antony look over Caesar's head,6
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,6
Tis not a time,6
Every time,6
But small to greater matters must give way.,6
Your speech is passion:,6
The noble Antony.,6
And yonder Caesar.,6
If we compose well here to Parthia:,6
I do not know,6
Noble friends,6
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,6
Our trivial difference loud we do commit,6
The rather for I earnestly beseech,6
Nor curstness grow to the matter.,6
Were we before our armies and to fight.,6
Flourish,6
Thank you.,6
Sit sir.,6
I learn you take things ill which are not so,6
I must be laugh'd at,6
Should say myself offended and with you,6
Once name you derogately when to sound your name,6
My being in Egypt Caesar,6
No more than my residing here at Rome,6
Did practise on my state your being in Egypt,6
How intend you practised?,6
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother,6
Was theme for you you were the word of war.,6
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;,6
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather,6
And make the wars alike against my stomach,6
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,6
It must not be with this.,6
By laying defects of judgment to me; but,6
Not so not so;,6
Very necessity of this thought that I,6
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars,6
I would you had her spirit in such another:,6
You may pace easy but not such a wife.,6
to wars with the women!,6
Made out of her impatience which not wanted,6
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must,6
I wrote to you,6
Did pocket up my letters and with taunts,6
Sir,6
Three kings I had newly feasted and did want,6
I told him of myself; which was as much,6
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,6
You have broken,6
Have tongue to charge me with.,6
No,6
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,6
The article of my oath.,6
The which you both denied.,6
And then when poison'd hours had bound me up,6
I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty,6
Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia,6
For which myself the ignorant motive do,6
To stoop in such a case.,6
If it might please you to enforce no further,6
Were to remember that the present need,6
Worthily spoken Mecaenas.,6
instant you may when you hear no more words of,6
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.,6
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.,6
Go to then; your considerate stone.,6
The manner of his speech; for't cannot be,6
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew,6
O' the world I would pursue it.,6
Speak Agrippa.,6
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony,6
Say not so Agrippa:,6
Were well deserved of rashness.,6
Agrippa further speak.,6
To make you brothers and to knit your hearts,6
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims,6
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak,6
All little jealousies which now seem great,6
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,6
Would each to other and all loves to both,6
For 'tis a studied not a present thought,6
Will Caesar speak?,6
With what is spoke already.,6
If I would say 'Agrippa be it so',6
The power of Caesar and,6
May I never,6
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:,6
The heart of brothers govern in our loves,6
There is my hand.,6
Did ever love so dearly: let her live,6
Fly off our loves again!,6
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;,6
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,6
At heel of that defy him.,6
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,6
Where lies he?,6
What is his strength by land?,6
He is an absolute master.,6
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:,6
The business we have talk'd of.,6
And do invite you to my sister's view,6
Let us Lepidus,6
Noble Antony,6
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS,6
Half the heart of Caesar worthy Mecaenas! My,6
Good Enobarbus!,6
digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.,6
made the night light with drinking.,6
but twelve persons there; is this true?,6
monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting.,6
her.,6
his heart upon the river of Cydnus.,6
well for her.,6
The barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne,6
Purple the sails and so perfumed that,6
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made,6
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,6
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--,6
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her,6
With divers-colour'd fans whose wind did seem,6
And what they undid did.,6
Her gentlewomen like the Nereides,6
And made their bends adornings: at the helm,6
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,6
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense,6
Her people out upon her; and Antony,6
Whistling to the air; which but for vacancy,6
And made a gap in nature.,6
Upon her landing Antony sent to her,6
It should be better he became her guest;,6
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,6
And for his ordinary pays his heart,6
Royal wench!,6
He plough'd her and she cropp'd.,6
Hop forty paces through the public street;,6
That she did make defect perfection,6
Now Antony must leave her utterly.,6
Age cannot wither her nor custom stale,6
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry,6
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests,6
If beauty wisdom modesty can settle,6
A blessed lottery to him.,6
Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest,6
Humbly sir I thank you.,6
SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.,6
The world and my great office will sometimes,6
All which time,6
To them for you.,6
Read not my blemishes in the world's report:,6
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night dear lady.,6
Good night.,6
Enter Soothsayer,6
Would I had never come from thence nor you Thither!,6
I see it in,6
Hie you to Egypt again.,6
Whose fortunes shall rise higher Caesar's or mine?,6
Therefore O Antony stay not by his side:,6
Noble courageous high unmatchable,6
Becomes a fear as being o'erpower'd: therefore,6
Speak this no more.,6
If thou dost play with him at any game,6
He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,6
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;,6
Get thee gone:,6
Exit Soothsayer,6
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;,6
Under his chance: if we draw lots he speeds;,6
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever,6
And though I make this marriage for my peace,6
Enter VENTIDIUS,6
You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;,6
Exeunt,6
Enter LEPIDUS MECAENAS and AGRIPPA,6
Your generals after.,6
Will e'en but kiss Octavia and we'll follow.,6
Which will become you both farewell.,6
As I conceive the journey be at the Mount,6
Your way is shorter;,6
You'll win two days upon me.,6
Farewell.,6
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,6
Give me some music; music moody food,6
The music ho!,6
Let it alone; let's to billiards: come Charmian.,6
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd,6
As well as I can madam.,6
too short,6
Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,6
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce,6
I'll think them every one an Antony,6
Twas merry when,6
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook which he,6
That time--O times!--,6
I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,6
Then put my tires and mantles on him whilst,6
Enter a Messenger,6
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,6
Madam madam--,6
Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,6
My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings,6
First madam he is well.,6
But sirrah mark we use,6
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour,6
Good madam hear me.,6
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony,6
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,6
Not like a formal man.,6
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:,6
Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him,6
Rich pearls upon thee.,6
Well said.,6
Thou'rt an honest man.,6
Make thee a fortune from me.,6
I do not like 'But yet' it does allay,6
But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth,6
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,6
In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.,6
He's bound unto Octavia.,6
For the best turn i' the bed.,6
Madam he's married to Octavia.,6
Strikes him down,6
What say you? Hence,6
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes,6
She hales him up and down,6
Smarting in lingering pickle.,6
I that do bring the news made not the match.,6
And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst,6
And I will boot thee with what gift beside,6
He's married madam.,6
Draws a knife,6
What mean you madam? I have made no fault.,6
Good madam keep yourself within yourself:,6
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.,6
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:,6
He is afeard to come.,6
Exit CHARMIAN,6
A meaner than myself; since I myself,6
Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger,6
Though it be honest it is never good,6
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell,6
I have done my duty.,6
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,6
He's married madam.,6
Should I lie madam?,6
So half my Egypt were submerged and made,6
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face to me,6
I crave your highness' pardon.,6
Take no offence that I would not offend you:,6
Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.,6
That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:,6
Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,6
Exit Messenger,6
In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.,6
I am paid for't now.,6
I faint: O Iras Charmian! 'tis no matter.,6
Report the feature of Octavia her years,6
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.,6
Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,6
The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas,6
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me Charmian,6
Exeunt,6
Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door  with drum and trumpet: at another OCTAVIUS CAESAR  MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS MECAENAS with Soldiers marching,6
And we shall talk before we fight.,6
That first we come to words; and therefore have we,6
Which if thou hast consider'd let us know,6
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth,6
To you all three,6
Chief factors for the gods I do not know,6
Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,6
There saw you labouring for him. What was't,6
Made the all-honour'd honest Roman Brutus,6
To drench the Capitol; but that they would,6
Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen,6
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome,6
Take your time.,6
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land thou know'st,6
At land indeed,6
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,6
Be pleased to tell us--,6
The offers we have sent you.,6
Which do not be entreated to but weigh,6
And what may follow,6
You have made me offer,6
Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send,6
To part with unhack'd edges and bear back,6
That's our offer.,6
I came before you here a man prepared,6
Put me to some impatience: though I lose,6
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,6
Her welcome friendly.,6
And am well studied for a liberal thanks,6
Let me have your hand:,6
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,6
For I have gain'd by 't.,6
There is a change upon you.,6
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;,6
To make my heart her vassal.,6
I hope so Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:,6
And seal'd between us.,6
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's,6
That will I Pompey.,6
Or last your fine Egyptian cookery,6
Grew fat with feasting there.,6
I have fair meanings sir.,6
Then so much have I heard:,6
No more of that: he did so.,6
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.,6
Well;,6
Four feasts are toward.,6
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,6
Sir,6
When you have well deserved ten times as much,6
Enjoy thy plainness,6
Aboard my galley I invite you all:,6
Show us the way sir.,6
Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS,6
made this treaty.--You and I have known sir.,6
We have sir.,6
And you by land.,6
cannot be denied what I have done by land.,6
Yes something you can deny for your own,6
And you by land.,6
hand Menas: if our eyes had authority here they,6
All men's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are.,6
No slander; they steal hearts.,6
For my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.,6
If he do sure he cannot weep't back again.,6
here: pray you is he married to Cleopatra?,6
True sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.,6
Pray ye sir?,6
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.,6
not prophesy so.,6
marriage than the love of the parties.,6
seems to tie their friendship together will be the,6
holy cold and still conversation.,6
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.,6
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and as,6
amity shall prove the immediate author of their,6
he married but his occasion here.,6
I have a health for you.,6
Come let's away.,6
SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley off Misenum.,6
Here they'll be man. Some o' their plants are,6
will blow them down.,6
They have made him drink alms-drink.,6
cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his,6
But it raises the greater war between him and,6
Why this is to have a name in great men's,6
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.,6
to move in't are the holes where eyes should be,6
A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK  ANTONY LEPIDUS POMPEY AGRIPPA MECAENAS DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS MENAS with other captains,6
the flow o' the Nile,6
By the height the lowness or the mean if dearth,6
The more it promises: as it ebbs the seedsman,6
And shortly comes to harvest.,6
Ay Lepidus.,6
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.,6
Sit--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!,6
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.,6
pyramises are very goodly things; without,6
[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey a word.,6
what is't?,6
thee captain,6
[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.,6
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?,6
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,6
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of,6
What colour is it of?,6
Tis a strange serpent.,6
Will this description satisfy him?,6
very epicure.,6
that? away!,6
[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou,6
Rise from thy stool.,6
The matter?,6
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.,6
Be jolly lords.,6
Keep off them for you sink.,6
What say'st thou?,6
How should that be?,6
And though thou think me poor I am the man,6
Hast thou drunk well?,6
Thou art if thou darest be the earthly Jove:,6
Is thine if thou wilt ha't.,6
These three world-sharers these competitors,6
And when we are put off fall to their throats:,6
Ah this thou shouldst have done,6
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,6
Mine honour it. Repent that e'er thy tongue,6
I should have found it afterwards well done;,6
[Aside]  For this,6
Who seeks and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,6
This health to Lepidus!,6
Here's to thee Menas!,6
Fill till the cup be hid.,6
Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS,6
A' bears the third part of the world man; see'st,6
The third part then is drunk: would it were all,6
Drink thou; increase the reels.,6
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.,6
Here is to Caesar!,6
It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain,6
Be a child o' the time.,6
But I had rather fast from all four days,6
Ha my brave emperor!,6
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,6
Let's ha't good soldier.,6
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense,6
All take hands.,6
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;,6
As his strong sides can volley.,6
THE SONG.,6
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!,6
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:,6
Cup us till the world go round!,6
Let me request you off: our graver business,6
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb,6
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost,6
Good Antony your hand.,6
And shall sir; give's your hand.,6
You have my father's house--But what? we are friends.,6
Take heed you fall not.,6
Menas I'll not on shore.,6
These drums! these trumpets flutes! what!,6
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd sound out!,6
Ho! says a' There's my cap.,6
Exeunt,6
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.,6
Now darting Parthia art thou struck; and now,6
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body,6
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.,6
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,6
Mesopotamia and the shelters whither,6
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and,6
O Silius Silius,6
May make too great an act: for learn this Silius;,6
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.,6
More in their officer than person: Sossius,6
For quick accumulation of renown,6
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can,6
The soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss,6
I could do more to do Antonius good,6
Should my performance perish.,6
that,6
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!,6
That magical word of war we have effected;,6
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia,6
Where is he now?,6
The weight we must convey with's will permit,6
Exeunt,6
Enter AGRIPPA at one door DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another,6
They have dispatch'd with Pompey he is gone;,6
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,6
With the green sickness.,6
A very fine one: O how he loves Caesar!,6
Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.,6
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!,6
Would you praise Caesar say 'Caesar:' go no further.,6
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:,6
poets cannot,6
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,6
Both he loves.,6
Trumpets within,6
This is to horse. Adieu noble Agrippa.,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS and OCTAVIA,6
You take from me a great part of myself;,6
As my thoughts make thee and as my farthest band,6
Let not the piece of virtue which is set,6
To keep it builded be the ram to batter,6
Have loved without this mean if on both parts,6
Make me not offended,6
I have said.,6
Though you be therein curious the least cause,6
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!,6
Farewell my dearest sister fare thee well:,6
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.,6
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,6
Sir look well to my husband's house; and--,6
I'll tell you in your ear.,6
Her heart inform her tongue--the swan's,6
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,6
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?,6
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,6
So is he being a man.,6
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,6
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.,6
troubled with a rheum;,6
Believe't till I wept too.,6
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not,6
Come sir come;,6
Look here I have you; thus I let you go,6
Adieu; be happy!,6
To thy fair way!,6
Kisses OCTAVIA,6
Trumpets sound. Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and ALEXAS,6
Half afeard to come.,6
Enter the Messenger as before,6
Good majesty,6
But when you are well pleased.,6
I'll have: but how when Antony is gone,6
Most gracious majesty--,6
Ay dread queen.,6
Madam in Rome;,6
Between her brother and Mark Antony.,6
She is not madam.,6
Madam I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.,6
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.,6
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,6
She creeps:,6
She shows a body rather than a life,6
Is this certain?,6
Three in Egypt,6
He's very knowing;,6
The fellow has good judgment.,6
Guess at her years I prithee.,6
She was a widow--,6
And I do think she's thirty.,6
Round even to faultiness.,6
Her hair what colour?,6
As low as she would wish it.,6
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:,6
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;,6
Exit Messenger,6
Indeed he is so: I repent me much,6
This creature's no such thing.,6
The man hath seen some majesty and should know.,6
And serving you so long!,6
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me,6
I warrant you madam.,6
SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.,6
Nay nay Octavia not only that--,6
Of semblable import--but he hath waged,6
To public ear:,6
But pay me terms of honour cold and sickly,6
When the best hint was given him he not took't,6
O my good lord,6
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,6
Praying for both parts:,6
When I shall pray 'O bless my lord and husband!',6
O bless my brother!' Husband win win brother,6
Twixt these extremes at all.,6
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks,6
I lose myself: better I were not yours,6
Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time lady,6
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;,6
Thanks to my lord.,6
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be,6
Should solder up the rift.,6
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults,6
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;,6
Your heart has mind to.,6
SCENE V. The same. Another room.,6
How now friend Eros!,6
What man?,6
This is old: what is the success?,6
Pompey presently denied him rivality; would not let,6
resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly,6
the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine.,6
And throw between them all the food thou hast,6
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns,6
And threats the throat of that his officer,6
Our great navy's rigg'd.,6
My lord desires you presently: my news,6
Twill be naught:,6
Come sir.,6
SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.,6
Contemning Rome he has done all this and more,6
I' the market-place on a tribunal silver'd,6
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat,6
And all the unlawful issue that their lust,6
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her,6
Absolute queen.,6
I' the common show-place where they exercise.,6
Great Media Parthia and Armenia.,6
Syria Cilicia and Phoenicia: she,6
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,6
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.,6
Already will their good thoughts call from him.,6
His accusations.,6
Caesar: and that having in Sicily,6
His part o' the isle: then does he say he lent me,6
That Lepidus of the triumvirate,6
All his revenue.,6
Tis done already and the messenger gone.,6
That he his high authority abused,6
I grant him part; but then in his Armenia,6
Demand the like.,6
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.,6
Hail Caesar and my lord! hail most dear Caesar!,6
You have not call'd me so nor have you cause.,6
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony,6
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach,6
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,6
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,6
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented,6
Is often left unloved; we should have met you,6
With an augmented greeting.,6
To come thus was I not constrain'd but did,6
Hearing that you prepared for war acquainted,6
His pardon for return.,6
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.,6
I have eyes upon him,6
Where is he now?,6
No my most wronged sister; Cleopatra,6
Up to a whore; who now are levying,6
Bocchus the king of Libya; Archelaus,6
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king Adallas;,6
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates king,6
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,6
Ay me most wretched,6
That do afflict each other!,6
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;,6
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;,6
O'er your content these strong necessities;,6
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;,6
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,6
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;,6
Welcome lady.,6
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:,6
In his abominations turns you off;,6
That noises it against us.,6
Most certain. Sister welcome: pray you,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
But why why why?,6
And say'st it is not fit.,6
If not denounced against us why should not we,6
[Aside]  Well I could reply:,6
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear,6
What is't you say?,6
Take from his heart take from his brain,6
What should not then be spared. He is already,6
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids,6
Sink Rome and their tongues rot,6
And as the president of my kingdom will,6
I will not stay behind.,6
Here comes the emperor.,6
Is it not strange Canidius,6
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,6
Celerity is never more admired,6
A good rebuke,6
To taunt at slackness. Canidius we,6
By sea! what else?,6
For that he dares us to't.,6
Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.,6
Which serve not for his vantage be shakes off;,6
Your ships are not well mann'd;,6
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet,6
Their ships are yare; yours heavy: no disgrace,6
Being prepared for land.,6
Most worthy sir you therein throw away,6
Distract your army which doth most consist,6
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego,6
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,6
I'll fight at sea.,6
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;,6
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,6
Enter a Messenger,6
The news is true my lord; he is descried;,6
Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;,6
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,6
Away my Thetis!,6
How now worthy soldier?,6
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt,6
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we,6
And fighting foot to foot.,6
Exeunt MARK ANTONY QUEEN CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
Soldier thou art: but his whole action grows,6
And we are women's men.,6
The legions and the horse whole do you not?,6
Publicola and Caelius are for sea:,6
Carries beyond belief.,6
His power went out in such distractions as,6
Who's his lieutenant hear you?,6
Well I know the man.,6
The emperor calls Canidius.,6
Each minute some.,6
SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.,6
Taurus!,6
Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,6
The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place,6
And so proceed accordingly.,6
SCENE X. Another part of the plain.,6
Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
The Antoniad the Egyptian admiral,6
To see't mine eyes are blasted.,6
Gods and goddesses,6
What's thy passion!,6
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away,6
How appears the fight?,6
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt--,6
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,6
The breese upon her like a cow in June,6
That I beheld:,6
Endure a further view.,6
The noble ruin of her magic Antony,6
Leaving the fight in height flies after her:,6
Experience manhood honour ne'er before,6
Alack alack!,6
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,6
Been what he knew himself it had gone well:,6
Most grossly by his own!,6
Why then good night indeed.,6
Tis easy to't; and there I will attend,6
To Caesar will I render,6
Show me the way of yielding.,6
The wounded chance of Antony though my reason,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants,6
It is ashamed to bear me! Friends come hither:,6
Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship,6
And make your peace with Caesar.,6
I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards,6
I have myself resolved upon a course,6
My treasure's in the harbour take it. O,6
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white,6
For fear and doting. Friends be gone: you shall,6
Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,6
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left,6
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.,6
Nay do so; for indeed I have lost command,6
Sits down,6
Nay gentle madam to him comfort him.,6
Do! why: what else?,6
No no no no no.,6
O fie fie fie!,6
Madam O good empress!,6
Yes my lord yes; he at Philippi kept,6
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I,6
Dealt on lieutenantry and no practise had,6
Ah stand by.,6
Go to him madam speak to him:,6
Well then sustain him: O!,6
Her head's declined and death will seize her but,6
I have offended reputation,6
Sir the queen.,6
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes,6
Stroy'd in dishonour.,6
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought,6
Egypt thou knew'st too well,6
And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit,6
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods,6
O my pardon!,6
To the young man send humble treaties dodge,6
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,6
How much you were my conqueror; and that,6
Obey it on all cause.,6
Fall not a tear I say; one of them rates,6
Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;,6
Some wine within there and our viands! Fortune knows,6
Exeunt,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR DOLABELLA THYREUS with others,6
Know you him?,6
An argument that he is pluck'd when hither,6
Which had superfluous kings for messengers,6
Enter EUPHRONIUS ambassador from MARK ANTONY,6
Such as I am I come from Antony:,6
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf,6
Be't so: declare thine office.,6
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,6
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,6
Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;,6
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,6
For Antony,6
Of audience nor desire shall fail so she,6
Or take his life there: this if she perform,6
Fortune pursue thee!,6
Exit EUPHRONIUS,6
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,6
From thine invention offers: women are not,6
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning Thyreus;,6
Will answer as a law.,6
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,6
In every power that moves.,6
Exeunt,6
Enter CLEOPATRA DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS CHARMIAN and IRAS,6
Think and die.,6
Antony only that would make his will,6
From that great face of war whose several ranges,6
The itch of his affection should not then,6
When half to half the world opposed he being,6
Than was his loss to course your flying flags,6
Prithee peace.,6
Is that his answer?,6
The queen shall then have courtesy so she,6
He says so.,6
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,6
With principalities.,6
To him again: tell him he wears the rose,6
Something particular: his coin ships legions,6
Under the service of a child as soon,6
To lay his gay comparisons apart,6
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.,6
[Aside]  Yes like enough high-battled Caesar will,6
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are,6
Do draw the inward quality after them,6
Knowing all measures the full Caesar will,6
His judgment too.,6
A messenger from CAESAR.,6
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose,6
Exit Attendant,6
The loyalty well held to fools does make,6
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord,6
And earns a place i' the story.,6
Caesar's will?,6
None but friends: say boldly.,6
He needs as many sir as Caesar has;,6
Will leap to be his friend: for us you know,6
So.,6
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,6
Go on: right royal.,6
As you did love but as you fear'd him.,6
The scars upon your honour therefore he,6
Not as deserved.,6
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,6
[Aside]             To be sure of that,6
That we must leave thee to thy sinking for,6
Exit,6
What you require of him? for he partly begs,6
That of his fortunes you should make a staff,6
To hear from me you had left Antony,6
The universal landlord.,6
My name is Thyreus.,6
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation,6
To lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel:,6
The doom of Egypt.,6
Wisdom and fortune combating together,6
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay,6
Your Caesar's father oft,6
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,6
Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
What art thou fellow?,6
The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest,6
[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.,6
and devils!,6
Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth,6
Antony yet.,6
Take hence this Jack and whip him.,6
Than with an old one dying.,6
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries,6
So saucy with the hand of she here--what's her name,6
Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,6
Mark Antony!,6
Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall,6
Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS,6
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,6
And by a gem of women to be abused,6
Good my lord--,6
But when we in our viciousness grow hard--,6
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us,6
To our confusion.,6
I found you as a morsel cold upon,6
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,6
Luxuriously pick'd out: for I am sure,6
You know not what it is.,6
To let a fellow that will take rewards,6
My playfellow your hand; this kingly seal,6
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar,6
And to proclaim it civilly were like,6
For being yare about him.,6
Is he whipp'd?,6
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?,6
If that thy father live let him repent,6
To follow Caesar in his triumph since,6
The white hand of a lady fever thee,6
Tell him thy entertainment: look thou say,6
Proud and disdainful harping on what I am,6
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,6
Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires,6
My speech and what is done tell him he has,6
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,6
Hence with thy stripes begone!,6
Have you done yet?,6
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone,6
I must stay his time.,6
With one that ties his points?,6
Cold-hearted toward me?,6
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,6
Drop in my neck: as it determines so,6
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,6
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,6
Have buried them for prey!,6
Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where,6
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too,6
Where hast thou been my heart? Dost thou hear lady?,6
To kiss these lips I will appear in blood;,6
There's hope in't yet.,6
I will be treble-sinew'd hearted breathed,6
Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives,6
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,6
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;,6
It is my birth-day:,6
Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra.,6
Call all his noble captains to my lord.,6
The wine peep through their scars. Come on my queen;,6
I'll make death love me; for I will contend,6
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood,6
A diminution in our captain's brain,6
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek,6
Exit,6
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.,6
He calls me boy; and chides as he had power,6
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,6
I have many other ways to die; meantime,6
Caesar must think,6
Even to falling. Give him no breath but now,6
Made good guard for itself.,6
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles,6
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,6
And feast the army; we have store to do't,6
Exeunt,6
Enter MARK ANTONY CLEOPATRA DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS CHARMIAN IRAS ALEXAS with others,6
No.,6
He thinks being twenty times of better fortune,6
To-morrow soldier,6
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood,6
I'll strike and cry 'Take all.',6
Call forth my household servants: let's to-night,6
Enter three or four Servitors,6
Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--,6
And kings have been your fellows.,6
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those odd,6
Out of the mind.,6
I wish I could be made so many men,6
An Antony that I might do you service,6
The gods forbid!,6
Scant not my cups; and make as much of me,6
And suffer'd my command.,6
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.,6
May be it is the period of your duty:,6
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow,6
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,6
Married to your good service stay till death:,6
And the gods yield you for't!,6
To give them this discomfort? Look they weep;,6
Transform us not to women.,6
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!,6
My hearty friends,6
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you,6
I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you,6
Than death and honour. Let's to supper come,6
Exeunt,6
Enter two Soldiers to their guard,6
It will determine one way: fare you well.,6
Nothing. What news?,6
Well sir good night.,6
Soldiers have careful watch.,6
They place themselves in every corner of the stage,6
Our navy thrive I have an absolute hope,6
Tis a brave army,6
Music of the hautboys as under the stage,6
List list!,6
Music i' the air.,6
It signs well does it not?,6
Peace I say!,6
Tis the god Hercules whom Antony loved,6
Walk; let's see if other watchmen,6
They advance to another post,6
[Speaking together]  How now!,6
Ay; is't not strange?,6
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;,6
Content. 'Tis strange.,6
SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.,6
Eros! mine armour Eros!,6
No my chuck. Eros come; mine armour Eros!,6
Come good fellow put mine iron on:,6
Because we brave her: come.,6
What's this for?,6
The armourer of my heart: false false; this this.,6
Well well;,6
Go put on thy defences.,6
Is not this buckled well?,6
He that unbuckles this till we do please,6
Thou fumblest Eros; and my queen's a squire,6
That thou couldst see my wars to-day and knew'st,6
A workman in't.,6
Good morrow to thee; welcome:,6
To business that we love we rise betime,6
A thousand sir,6
And at the port expect you.,6
Enter Captains and Soldiers,6
Good morrow general.,6
This morning like the spirit of a youth,6
So so; come give me that: this way; well said.,6
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable,6
And worthy shameful cheque it were to stand,6
Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,6
Exeunt MARK ANTONY EROS Captains and Soldiers,6
Lead me.,6
Determine this great war in single fight!,6
Exeunt,6
Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them,6
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd,6
Hadst thou done so,6
That has this morning left thee would have still,6
Who's gone this morning?,6
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,6
Say 'I am none of thine.',6
Sir,6
Sir his chests and treasure,6
Is he gone?,6
Go Eros send his treasure after; do it;,6
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;,6
To change a master. O my fortunes have,6
Exeunt,6
Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR AGRIPPA with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and others,6
Our will is Antony be took alive;,6
Caesar I shall.,6
The time of universal peace is near:,6
Shall bear the olive freely.,6
Antony,6
Go charge Agrippa,6
That Antony may seem to spend his fury,6
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade,6
And leave his master Antony: for this pains,6
That fell away have entertainment but,6
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,6
Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's,6
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure with,6
Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now,6
I give it you.,6
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer,6
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor,6
Exit,6
And feel I am so most. O Antony,6
My better service when my turpitude,6
If swift thought break it not a swifter mean,6
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek,6
My latter part of life.,6
SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.,6
Retire we have engaged ourselves too far:,6
Exceeds what we expected.,6
Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded,6
Had we done so at first we had droven them home,6
Thou bleed'st apace.,6
But now 'tis made an H.,6
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet,6
Enter EROS,6
For a fair victory.,6
And snatch 'em up as we take hares behind:,6
I will reward thee,6
For thy good valour. Come thee on.,6
Exeunt,6
Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY in a march; SCARUS with others,6
And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,6
That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;,6
Not as you served the cause but as 't had been,6
Enter the city clip your wives your friends,6
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss,6
To SCARUS,6
Enter CLEOPATRA attended,6
Make her thanks bless thee.,6
O thou day o' the world,6
Through proof of harness to my heart and there,6
Lord of lords!,6
The world's great snare uncaught?,6
We have beat them to their beds. What girl!,6
Do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha' we,6
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;,6
Kiss it my warrior: he hath fought to-day,6
Destroy'd in such a shape.,6
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.,6
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:,6
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:,6
To camp this host we all would sup together,6
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,6
Make mingle with rattling tabourines;,6
Applauding our approach.,6
SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.,6
If we be not relieved within this hour,6
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle,6
This last day was,6
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6
What man is this?,6
Be witness to me O thou blessed moon,6
Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did,6
Enobarbus!,6
Hark further.,6
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,6
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart,6
Which being dried with grief will break to powder,6
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,6
But let the world rank me in register,6
O Antony! O Antony!,6
Let's speak To him.,6
May concern Caesar.,6
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his,6
Go we to him.,6
Hear you sir?,6
Drums afar off,6
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him,6
Is fully out.,6
He may recover yet.,6
SCENE X. Between the two camps.,6
Their preparation is to-day by sea;,6
For both my lord.,6
We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot,6
Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;,6
Where their appointment we may best discover,6
Exeunt,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his Army,6
Which as I take't we shall; for his best force,6
And hold our best advantage.,6
SCENE XII. Another part of the same.,6
Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine,6
I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word,6
Exit,6
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers,6
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony,6
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear,6
Alarum afar off as at a sea-fight,6
All is lost;,6
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder,6
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!,6
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart,6
For when I am revenged upon my charm,6
Exit SCARUS,6
Fortune and Antony part here; even here,6
That spaniel'd me at heels to whom I gave,6
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,6
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm--,6
Whose bosom was my crownet my chief end--,6
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.,6
Enter CLEOPATRA,6
Why is my lord enraged against his love?,6
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,6
Follow his chariot like the greatest spot,6
For poor'st diminutives for doits; and let,6
With her prepared nails.,6
Tis well thou'rt gone,6
Thou fell'st into my fury for one death,6
The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,6
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;,6
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:,6
Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros ho!,6
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.,6
Help me my women! O he is more mad,6
Was never so emboss'd.,6
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.,6
Than greatness going off.,6
Mardian go tell him I have slain myself;,6
And word it prithee piteously: hence Mardian,6
To the monument!,6
SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.,6
Eros thou yet behold'st me?,6
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;,6
A tower'd citadel a pendent rock,6
With trees upon't that nod unto the world,6
these signs;,6
Ay my lord,6
The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct,6
It does my lord.,6
Even such a body: here I am Antony:,6
I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen--,6
Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't,6
Pack'd cards with Caesar and false-play'd my glory,6
Nay weep not gentle Eros; there is left us,6
Enter MARDIAN,6
She has robb'd me of my sword.,6
My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled,6
Hence saucy eunuch; peace!,6
Death of one person can be paid but once,6
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake,6
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break,6
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,6
Dead then?,6
Unarm Eros; the long day's task is done,6
To MARDIAN,6
Does pay thy labour richly; go.,6
Off pluck off:,6
The battery from my heart. O cleave my sides!,6
Crack thy frail case! Apace Eros apace.,6
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.,6
I will o'ertake thee Cleopatra and,6
All length is torture: since the torch is out,6
Mars what it does; yea very force entangles,6
Eros!--I come my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:,6
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:,6
And all the haunt be ours. Come Eros Eros!,6
What would my lord?,6
I have lived in such dishonour that the gods,6
Quarter'd the world and o'er green Neptune's back,6
The courage of a woman; less noble mind,6
I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn Eros,6
Is come indeed when I should see behind me,6
Disgrace and horror that on my command,6
Thou strikest not me 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.,6
The gods withhold me!,6
Though enemy lost aim and could not?,6
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see,6
His corrigible neck his face subdued,6
Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded,6
I would not see't.,6
Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn,6
O sir pardon me!,6
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;,6
But accidents unpurposed. Draw and come.,6
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.,6
Turning from him,6
Then let it do at once,6
My dear master,6
Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell.,6
Farewell great chief. Shall I strike now?,6
Why there then: thus I do escape the sorrow,6
Kills himself,6
Thou teachest me O valiant Eros what,6
Have by their brave instruction got upon me,6
A bridegroom in my death and run into't,6
Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus,6
I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?,6
Enter DERCETAS and Guard,6
I have done my work in friends: O make an end,6
The star is fall'n.,6
Alas and woe!,6
Not I.,6
Nor any one.,6
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.,6
Shall enter me with him.,6
Where's Antony?,6
Lives he?,6
Exit DERCETAS,6
Sufficing strokes for death.,6
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.,6
Now my lord.,6
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear,6
Which never shall be found--you did suspect,6
Would not be purged she sent you word she was dead;,6
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,6
Too late good Diomed: call my guard I prithee.,6
Come your lord calls!,6
Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides;,6
Woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear,6
Most heavy day!,6
To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome,6
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:,6
And have my thanks for all.,6
SCENE XV. The same. A monument.,6
O Charmian I will never go from hence.,6
No I will not:,6
But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,6
As that which makes it.,6
How now! is he dead?,6
Look out o' the other side your monument;,6
Enter below MARK ANTONY borne by the Guard,6
Burn the great sphere thou movest in!,6
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,6
Help friends below; let's draw him hither.,6
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,6
So it should be that none but Antony,6
I am dying Egypt dying; only,6
Of many thousand kisses the poor last,6
I dare not dear--,6
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show,6
Be brooch'd with me; if knife drugs,6
Edge sting or operation I am safe:,6
And still conclusion shall acquire no honour,6
Help me my women--we must draw thee up:,6
O quick or I am gone.,6
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,6
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,6
Wishes were ever fools--O come come come;,6
And welcome welcome! die where thou hast lived:,6
Thus would I wear them out.,6
I am dying Egypt dying:,6
No let me speak; and let me rail so high,6
Provoked by my offence.,6
Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety. O!,6
Gentle hear me:,6
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;,6
The miserable change now at my end,6
In feeding them with those my former fortunes,6
The noblest; and do now not basely die,6
My countryman--a Roman by a Roman,6
I can no more.,6
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide,6
No better than a sty? O see my women,6
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!,6
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls,6
And there is nothing left remarkable,6
Faints,6
She is dead too our sovereign.,6
Madam!,6
Royal Egypt Empress!,6
No more but e'en a woman and commanded,6
And does the meanest chares. It were for me,6
To tell them that this world did equal theirs,6
Patience is scottish and impatience does,6
To rush into the secret house of death,6
What what! good cheer! Why how now Charmian!,6
Our lamp is spent it's out! Good sirs take heart:,6
what's noble,6
And make death proud to take us. Come away:,6
Ah women women! come; we have no friend,6
Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body,6
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.,6
Go to him Dolabella bid him yield;,6
The pauses that he makes.,6
Exit,6
Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest,6
I am call'd Dercetas;,6
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,6
To spend upon his haters. If thou please,6
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,6
What is't thou say'st?,6
The breaking of so great a thing should make,6
Should have shook lions into civil streets,6
Is not a single doom; in the name lay,6
He is dead Caesar:,6
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,6
Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it,6
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd,6
Look you sad friends?,6
To wash the eyes of kings.,6
That nature must compel us to lament,6
His taints and honours,6
A rarer spirit never,6
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.,6
He needs must see himself.,6
I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance,6
Have shown to thee such a declining day,6
In the whole world: but yet let me lament,6
That thou my brother my competitor,6
Friend and companion in the front of war,6
Where mine his thoughts did kindle--that our stars,6
Our equalness to this. Hear me good friends--,6
Enter an Egyptian,6
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?,6
Confined in all she has her monument,6
That she preparedly may frame herself,6
Bid her have good heart:,6
How honourable and how kindly we,6
To be ungentle.,6
Exit,6
We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts,6
Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke,6
Would be eternal in our triumph: go,6
And how you find of her.,6
Exit,6
Exit GALLUS,6
To second Proculeius?,6
Let him alone for I remember now,6
Go with me to my tent; where you shall see,6
How calm and gentle I proceeded still,6
What I can show in this.,6
SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.,6
My desolation does begin to make,6
Not being Fortune he's but Fortune's knave,6
To do that thing that ends all other deeds;,6
Which sleeps and never palates more the dug,6
Enter to the gates of the monument PROCULEIUS GALLUS and Soldiers,6
And bids thee study on what fair demands,6
What's thy name?,6
Antony,6
I do not greatly care to be deceived,6
Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him,6
No less beg than a kingdom: if he please,6
He gives me so much of mine own as I,6
Be of good cheer;,6
Make your full reference freely to my lord,6
On all that need: let me report to him,6
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,6
Pray you tell him,6
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn,6
Look him i' the face.,6
Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied,6
You see how easily she may be surprised:,6
To PROCULEIUS and the Guard,6
Exit,6
O Cleopatra! thou art taken queen:,6
Drawing a dagger,6
Seizes and disarms her,6
Relieved but not betray'd.,6
That rids our dogs of languish?,6
Do not abuse my master's bounty by,6
His nobleness well acted which your death,6
Where art thou death?,6
Worthy many babes and beggars!,6
Sir I will eat no meat I'll not drink sir;,6
I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,6
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;,6
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,6
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt,6
Lay me stark naked and let the water-flies,6
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,6
You do extend,6
Find cause in Caesar.,6
Proculeius,6
And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,6
So Dolabella,6
To CLEOPATRA,6
If you'll employ me to him.,6
Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers,6
I cannot tell.,6
No matter sir what I have heard or known.,6
Is't not your trick?,6
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:,6
But such another man!,6
His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck,6
and lighted,6
Most sovereign creature--,6
Crested the world: his voice was propertied,6
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,6
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas,6
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above,6
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were,6
Cleopatra!,6
As this I dream'd of?,6
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.,6
It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff,6
And Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,6
Hear me good madam.,6
As answering to the weight: would I might never,6
By the rebound of yours a grief that smites,6
I thank you sir,6
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.,6
Though he be honourable--,6
Madam he will; I know't.,6
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR GALLUS PROCULEIUS MECAENAS SELEUCUS and others of his Train,6
It is the emperor madam.,6
Arise you shall not kneel:,6
Sir the gods,6
I must obey.,6
The record of what injuries you did us,6
As things but done by chance.,6
I cannot project mine own cause so well,6
Been laden with like frailties which before,6
Cleopatra know,6
If you apply yourself to our intents,6
A benefit in this change; but if you seek,6
Antony's course you shall bereave yourself,6
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,6
And may through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,6
Hang in what place you please. Here my good lord.,6
This is the brief of money plate and jewels,6
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?,6
This is my treasurer: let him speak my lord,6
To myself nothing. Speak the truth Seleucus.,6
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril,6
What have I kept back?,6
Nay blush not Cleopatra; I approve,6
See Caesar! O behold,6
And should we shift estates yours would be mine.,6
Even make me wild: O slave of no more trust,6
Go back I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,6
O rarely base!,6
O Caesar what a wounding shame is this,6
Doing the honour of thy lordliness,6
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by,6
That I some lady trifles have reserved,6
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,6
For Livia and Octavia to induce,6
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me,6
To SELEUCUS,6
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits,6
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.,6
Exit SELEUCUS,6
For things that others do; and when we fall,6
Are therefore to be pitied.,6
Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged,6
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,6
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;,6
For we intend so to dispose you as,6
Our care and pity is so much upon you,6
My master and my lord!,6
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train,6
Be noble to myself: but hark thee Charmian.,6
Finish good lady; the bright day is done,6
Hie thee again:,6
Go put it to the haste.,6
Re-enter DOLABELLA,6
Behold sir.,6
Dolabella!,6
Which my love makes religion to obey,6
Intends his journey; and within three days,6
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd,6
Dolabella,6
I your servant,6
Farewell and thanks.,6
Now Iras what think'st thou?,6
In Rome as well as I mechanic slaves,6
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,6
And forced to drink their vapour.,6
Nay 'tis most certain Iras: saucy lictors,6
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians,6
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony,6
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness,6
O the good gods!,6
I'll never see 't; for I am sure my nails,6
Why that's the way,6
Their most absurd intents.,6
Now Charmian!,6
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,6
Now noble Charmian we'll dispatch indeed;,6
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.,6
Exit IRAS. A noise within,6
Here is a rural fellow,6
He brings you figs.,6
Exit Guardsman,6
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.,6
Of woman in me: now from head to foot,6
No planet is of mine.,6
This is the man.,6
Exit Guardsman,6
That kills and pains not?,6
that should desire you to touch him for his biting,6
never recover.,6
Very many men and women too. I heard of one of,6
but something given to lie; as a woman should not,6
biting of it what pain she felt: truly she makes,6
believe all that they say shall never be saved by,6
worm's an odd worm.,6
I wish you all joy of the worm.,6
Farewell.,6
do his kind.,6
Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the,6
goodness in worm.,6
Very good. Give it nothing I pray you for it is,6
Will it eat me?,6
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a,6
not. But truly these same whoreson devils do the,6
that they make the devils mar five.,6
Yes forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.,6
Re-enter IRAS with a robe crown  and c,6
Immortal longings in me: now no more,6
Yare yare good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear,6
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock,6
To excuse their after wrath: husband I come:,6
I am fire and air; my other elements,6
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips.,6
Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies,6
If thou and nature can so gently part,6
Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?,6
It is not worth leave-taking.,6
The gods themselves do weep!,6
If she first meet the curled Antony,6
Which is my heaven to have. Come thou,6
To an asp which she applies to her breast,6
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool,6
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass,6
O eastern star!,6
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,6
O break! O break!,6
O Antony!--Nay I will take thee too.,6
What should I stay--,6
In this vile world? So fare thee well.,6
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows close;,6
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;,6
Enter the Guard rushing in,6
Speak softly wake her not.,6
Too slow a messenger.,6
O come apace dispatch! I partly feel thee.,6
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.,6
It is well done and fitting for a princess,6
Ah soldier!,6
Re-enter DOLABELLA,6
All dead.,6
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming,6
So sought'st to hinder.,6
Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching,6
That you did fear is done.,6
She levell'd at our purposes and being royal,6
I do not see them bleed.,6
A simple countryman that brought her figs:,6
Poison'd then.,6
This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:,6
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,6
O noble weakness!,6
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,6
In her strong toil of grace.,6
There is a vent of blood and something blown:,6
This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves,6
Upon the caves of Nile.,6
That so she died; for her physician tells me,6
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;,6
She shall be buried by her Antony:,6
A pair so famous. High events as these,6
No less in pity than his glory which,6
In solemn show attend this funeral;,6
High order in this great solemnity.,6
ACT I,7
Enter DUKE SOLINUS AEGEON Gaoler Officers and other Attendants,7
And by the doom of death end woes and all.,7
I am not partial to infringe our laws:,7
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke,7
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives,7
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.,7
Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,7
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,7
If any born at Ephesus be seen,7
Again: if any Syracusian born,7
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,7
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.,7
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;,7
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,7
Well Syracusian say in brief the cause,7
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.,7
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:,7
Was wrought by nature not by vile offence,7
In Syracusa was I born and wed,7
And by me had not our hap been bad.,7
By prosperous voyages I often made,7
And the great care of goods at random left,7
From whom my absence was not six months old,7
The pleasing punishment that women bear,7
And soon and safe arrived where I was.,7
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;,7
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.,7
A meaner woman was delivered,7
Those--for their parents were exceeding poor--,7
My wife not meanly proud of two such boys,7
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,7
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,7
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:,7
For what obscured light the heavens did grant,7
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;,7
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,7
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,7
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.,7
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,7
My wife more careful for the latter-born,7
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;,7
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:,7
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,7
And floating straight obedient to the stream,7
At length the sun gazing upon the earth,7
And by the benefit of his wished light,7
Two ships from far making amain to us,7
But ere they came--O let me say no more!,7
Nay forward old man; do not break off so;,7
O had the gods done so I had not now,7
For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,7
Which being violently borne upon,7
So that in this unjust divorce of us,7
What to delight in what to sorrow for.,7
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,7
And in our sight they three were taken up,7
At length another ship had seized on us;,7
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;,7
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;,7
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;,7
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.,7
Do me the favour to dilate at full,7
My youngest boy and yet my eldest care,7
After his brother: and importuned me,7
Reft of his brother but retain'd his name--,7
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,7
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,7
And coasting homeward came to Ephesus;,7
Or that or any place that harbours men.,7
And happy were I in my timely death,7
Hapless AEgeon whom the fates have mark'd,7
Now trust me were it not against our laws,7
Which princes would they may not disannul,7
But though thou art adjudged to the death,7
But to our honour's great disparagement,7
Therefore merchant I'll limit thee this day,7
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;,7
And live; if no then thou art doom'd to die.,7
I will my lord.,7
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.,7
SCENE II. The Mart.,7
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,7
This very day a Syracusian merchant,7
And not being able to buy out his life,7
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And stay there Dromio till I come to thee.,7
Till that I'll view the manners of the town,7
And then return and sleep within mine inn,7
Get thee away.,7
And go indeed having so good a mean.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
When I am dull with care and melancholy,7
What will you walk with me about the town,7
I am invited sir to certain merchants,7
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,7
And afterward consort you till bed-time:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And wander up and down to view the city.,7
Exit,7
He that commends me to mine own content,7
I to the world am like a drop of water,7
Who falling there to find his fellow forth,7
So I to find a mother and a brother,7
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus,7
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?,7
The capon burns the pig falls from the spit,7
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:,7
The meat is cold because you come not home;,7
You have no stomach having broke your fast;,7
Are penitent for your default to-day.,7
Stop in your wind sir: tell me this I pray:,7
O--sixpence that I had o' Wednesday last,7
The saddler had it sir; I kept it not.,7
I am not in a sportive humour now:,7
We being strangers here how darest thou trust,7
I pray you air as you sit at dinner:,7
If I return I shall be post indeed,7
Methinks your maw like mine should be your clock,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.,7
To me sir? why you gave no gold to me.,7
Come on sir knave have done your foolishness,7
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart,7
My mistress and her sister stays for you.,7
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,7
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:,7
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,7
But not a thousand marks between you both.,7
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.,7
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress slave hast thou?,7
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Being forbid? There take you that sir knave.,7
Nay and you will not sir I'll take my heels.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.,7
As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,7
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,7
And many such-like liberties of sin:,7
I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave:,7
Exit,7
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.,7
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,7
Sure Luciana it is two o'clock.,7
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.,7
A man is master of his liberty:,7
They'll go or come: if so be patient sister.,7
Because their business still lies out o' door.,7
O know he is the bridle of your will.,7
Why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.,7
But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky:,7
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:,7
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,7
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,7
Then let your will attend on their accords.,7
Not this but troubles of the marriage-bed.,7
Ere I learn love I'll practise to obey.,7
Till he come home again I would forbear.,7
They can be meek that have no other cause.,7
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;,7
As much or more would we ourselves complain:,7
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,7
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.,7
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.,7
Say is your tardy master now at hand?,7
can witness.,7
Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear:,7
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?,7
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce,7
But say I prithee is he coming home? It seems he,7
Why mistress sure my master is horn-mad.,7
I mean not cuckold-mad;,7
When I desired him to come home to dinner,7
'Tis dinner-time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;,7
Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.,7
The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:,7
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!',7
Quoth my master:,7
So that my errand due unto my tongue,7
For in conclusion he did beat me there.,7
Go back again and be new beaten home?,7
Back slave or I will break thy pate across.,7
Between you I shall have a holy head.,7
Am I so round with you as you with me,7
You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither:,7
Exit,7
His company must do his minions grace,7
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took,7
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?,7
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:,7
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:,7
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground,7
A sunny look of his would soon repair,7
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.,7
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.,7
Or else what lets it but he would be here?,7
Would that alone alone he would detain,7
I see the jewel best enamelled,7
That others touch and often touching will,7
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.,7
I'll weep what's left away and weeping die.,7
Exeunt,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse,7
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up,7
Is wander'd forth in care to seek me out,7
I could not speak with Dromio since at first,7
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse,7
As you love strokes so jest with me again.,7
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?,7
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I did not see you since you sent me hence,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;,7
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Think'st thou I jest? Hold take thou that and that.,7
Hold sir for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,7
And make a common of my serious hours.,7
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.,7
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,7
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering I,7
long I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce,7
But I pray sir why am I beaten?,7
Dost thou not know?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Ay sir and wherefore; for they say every why hath,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
For urging it the second time to me.,7
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme,7
Well sir I thank you.,7
Thank me sir for what?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
something. But say sir is it dinner-time?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Basting.,7
Well sir then 'twill be dry.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
time for all things.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
so plentiful an excrement?,7
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.,7
Why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
The plainer dealer the sooner lost: yet he loseth,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
For two; and sound ones too.,7
Nay not sound I pray you.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Certain ones then.,7
Name them.,7
trimming; the other that at dinner they should not,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
time for all things.,7
lost by nature.,7
But your reason was not substantial why there is no,7
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
But soft! who wafts us yonder?,7
Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown:,7
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.,7
That never words were music to thine ear,7
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,7
Unless I spake or look'd or touch'd or carved to thee.,7
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?,7
That undividable incorporate,7
Ah do not tear away thyself from me!,7
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,7
Without addition or diminishing,7
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,7
And that this body consecrate to thee,7
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,7
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,7
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?,7
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;,7
For if we too be one and thou play false,7
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.,7
I live unstain'd thou undishonoured.,7
Plead you to me fair dame? I know you not:,7
As strange unto your town as to your talk;,7
Want wit in all one word to understand.,7
When were you wont to use my sister thus?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
By me?,7
That he did buffet thee and in his blows,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
What is the course and drift of your compact?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Unless it be by inspiration.,7
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,7
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,7
Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:,7
Whose weakness married to thy stronger state,7
If aught possess thee from me it is dross,7
Who all for want of pruning with intrusion,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
What was I married to her in my dream?,7
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?,7
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.,7
O for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.,7
We talk with goblins owls and sprites:,7
They'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue.,7
Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot!,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nay master both in mind and in my shape.,7
Thou hast thine own form.,7
If thou art changed to aught 'tis to an ass.,7
Tis so I am an ass; else it could never be,7
Come come no longer will I be a fool,7
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.,7
Husband I'll dine above with you to-day,7
Sirrah if any ask you for your master,7
Come sister. Dromio play the porter well.,7
Am I in earth in heaven or in hell?,7
Known unto these and to myself disguised!,7
And in this mist at all adventures go.,7
Ay; and let none enter lest I break your pate.,7
Exeunt,7
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:,7
To see the making of her carcanet,7
But here's a villain that would face me down,7
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,7
Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this?,7
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show:,7
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.,7
I think thou art an ass.,7
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.,7
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.,7
You're sad Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer,7
I hold your dainties cheap sir and your,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.,7
Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:,7
Better cheer may you have but not with better heart.,7
Maud Bridget Marian Cicel Gillian Ginn!,7
idiot patch!,7
Dost thou conjure for wenches that thou call'st,7
When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.,7
the street.,7
catch cold on's feet.,7
Who talks within there? ho open the door!,7
me wherefore.,7
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.,7
when you may.,7
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?,7
is Dromio.,7
The one ne'er got me credit the other mickle blame.,7
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy,7
[Within]  What a coil is there Dromio? who are those,7
Let my master in Luce.,7
And so tell your master.,7
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?,7
can you tell?,7
answered him well.,7
OF EPHESUS,7
[Within]  And you said no.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?,7
[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.,7
You'll cry for this minion if I beat the door down.,7
[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all,7
[Within]  By my troth your town is troubled with,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
[Within]  Your wife sir knave! go get you from the door.,7
Here is neither cheer sir nor welcome: we would,7
In debating which was best we shall part with neither.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
You would say so master if your garments were thin.,7
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.,7
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.,7
knave's pate.,7
Ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind.,7
thee hind!,7
let me in.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
A crow without feather? Master mean you so?,7
If a crow help us in sirrah we'll pluck a crow together.,7
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.,7
Herein you war against your reputation,7
The unviolated honour of your wife.,7
Her sober virtue years and modesty,7
And doubt not sir but she will well excuse,7
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,7
And about evening come yourself alone,7
If by strong hand you offer to break in,7
A vulgar comment will be made of it,7
Against your yet ungalled estimation,7
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;,7
For ever housed where it gets possession.,7
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,7
I know a wench of excellent discourse,7
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,7
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:,7
To Angelo,7
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:,7
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--,7
Upon mine hostess there: good sir make haste.,7
I'll knock elsewhere to see if they'll disdain me.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Exeunt,7
Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse,7
A husband's office? shall Antipholus.,7
Shall love in building grow so ruinous?,7
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:,7
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:,7
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;,7
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;,7
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;,7
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?,7
And let her read it in thy looks at board:,7
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.,7
Being compact of credit that you love us;,7
We in your motion turn and you may move us.,7
Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife:,7
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.,7
Sweet mistress--what your name is else I know not,7
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not,7
Teach me dear creature how to think and speak;,7
Smother'd in errors feeble shallow weak,7
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you,7
Are you a god? would you create me new?,7
But if that I am I then well I know,7
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe,7
O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note,7
Sing siren for thyself and I will dote:,7
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,7
He gains by death that hath such means to die:,7
What are you mad that you do reason so?,7
Not mad but mated; how I do not know.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Gaze where you should and that will clear your sight.,7
As good to wink sweet love as look on night.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
That's my sister.,7
No;,7
Mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart,7

that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me.,7
What claim lays she to thee?,7
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that I,7
being a very beastly creature lays claim to me.,7
What is she?,7
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have,7
wondrous fat marriage.,7
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?,7
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a,7
warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a,7
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.,7
What complexion is she of?,7
clean kept: for why she sweats; a man may go over,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
No sir 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.,7
What's her name?,7
an ell and three quarters will not measure her from,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:,7
countries in her.,7
In what part of her body stands Ireland?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.,7
Where France?,7
against her heir.,7
Where England?,7
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Faith I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.,7
Where America the Indies?,7
rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich,7
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.,7
Where stood Belgia the Netherlands?,7
drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me,7
privy marks I had about me as the mark of my,7
left arm that I amazed ran from her as a witch:,7
faith and my heart of steel,7

Go hie thee presently post to the road:,7
I will not harbour in this town to-night:,7
Where I will walk till thou return to me.,7
Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone.,7
So fly I from her that would be my wife.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.,7
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,7
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,7
But lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,7
Enter ANGELO with the chain,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I know it well sir lo here is the chain.,7
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.,7
What is your will that I shall do with this?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Not once nor twice but twenty times you have.,7
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.,7
Exit,7
What I should think of this I cannot tell:,7
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.,7
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.,7
If any ship put out then straight away.,7

For locking me out of my doors by day.,7
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.,7
Exit,7
A man is well holp up that trusts to you:,7
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.,7
If it were chain'd together and therefore came not.,7
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,7
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more,7
I pray you see him presently discharged,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Besides I have some business in the town.,7
And with you take the chain and bid my wife,7
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Well sir I will. Have you the chain about you?,7
An if I have not sir I hope you have;,7
Nay come I pray you sir give me the chain:,7
And I to blame have held him here too long.,7
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse,7
I should have chid you for not bringing it,7
The hour steals on; I pray you sir dispatch.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Come come you know I gave it you even now.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7

Good sir say whether you'll answer me or no:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
The money that you owe me for the chain.,7
I owe you none till I receive the chain.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
You wrong me more sir in denying it:,7
Well officer arrest him at my suit.,7
This touches me in reputation.,7
Or I attach you by this officer.,7
Consent to pay thee that I never had!,7
Here is thy fee; arrest him officer,7
If he should scorn me so apparently.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
But sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear,7
Sir sir I will have law in Ephesus,7
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse from the bay,7
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,7
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought,7
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind,7
But for their owner master and yourself.,7
How now! a madman! Why thou peevish sheep,7
A ship you sent me to to hire waftage.,7
Thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope;,7
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.,7
Give her this key and tell her in the desk,7
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:,7
And that shall bail me; hie thee slave be gone!,7
Exeunt Second Merchant Angelo Officer and Antipholus of Ephesus,7
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:,7
Thither I must although against my will,7
Exit,7
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA,7
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye,7
Look'd he or red or pale or sad or merrily?,7
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?,7
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.,7
And true he swore though yet forsworn he were.,7
And what said he?,7
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?,7
First he did praise my beauty then my speech.,7
Have patience I beseech.,7
My tongue though not my heart shall have his will.,7
Ill-faced worse bodied shapeless everywhere;,7
Stigmatical in making worse in mind.,7
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.,7
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.,7
My heart prays for him though my tongue do curse.,7
Here! go; the desk the purse! sweet now make haste.,7
By running fast.,7
No he's in Tartar limbo worse than hell.,7
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;,7
A wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff;,7
countermands,7
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;,7
Why man what is the matter?,7
What is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.,7
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him that can I tell.,7
Go fetch it sister.,7
This I wonder at,7
Tell me was he arrested on a band?,7
A chain a chain! Do you not hear it ring?,7
No no the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:,7
strikes one.,7
O yes; if any hour meet a sergeant a' turns back for,7
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!,7
worth to season.,7
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?,7
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?,7
Go Dromio; there's the money bear it straight;,7
Come sister: I am press'd down with conceit--,7
Exeunt,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse,7
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me,7
And every one doth call me by my name.,7
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;,7
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,7
And therewithal took measure of my body.,7
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.,7
Master here's the gold you sent me for. What have,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam,7
skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came,7
forsake your liberty.,7
I understand thee not.,7
bass-viol in a case of leather; the man sir,7
and 'rests them; he sir that takes pity on decayed,7
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings,7
thinks a man always going to bed and says 'God,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Why sir I brought you word an hour since that the,7
you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy,7

The fellow is distract and so am I;,7
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!,7
Well met well met Master Antipholus.,7
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?,7
Satan avoid! I charge thee tempt me not.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nay she is worse she is the devil's dam; and here,7
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as,7
written they appear to men like angels of light:,7
ergo light wenches will burn. Come not near her.,7
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?,7
long spoon.,7
Why Dromio?,7
the devil.,7
Avoid then fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?,7
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.,7
Or for my diamond the chain you promised,7
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,7
A nut a cherry-stone;,7
Master be wise: an if you give it her,7
I pray you sir my ring or else the chain:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Fly pride' says the peacock: mistress that you know.,7
Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad,7
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,7
Both one and other he denies me now.,7
Besides this present instance of his rage,7
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.,7
On purpose shut the doors against his way.,7
And tell his wife that being lunatic,7
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;,7
Exit,7
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer,7
Fear me not man; I will not break away:,7
To warrant thee as I am 'rested for.,7
And will not lightly trust the messenger,7
I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her ears.,7
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.,7
Here's that I warrant you will pay them all.,7
But where's the money?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I'll serve you sir five hundred at the rate.,7
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Beating him,7
Nay 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.,7
Nay rather persuade him to hold his hands.,7
Thou whoreson senseless villain!,7
your blows.,7
ass.,7
ears. I have served him from the hour of my,7
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold he,7
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;,7
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when,7
beggar wont her brat; and I think when he hath,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Enter ADRIANA LUCIANA the Courtezan and PINCH,7
rather the prophecy like the parrot 'beware the,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Beating him,7
His incivility confirms no less.,7
Establish him in his true sense again,7
Alas how fiery and how sharp he looks!,7
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.,7
There is my hand and let it feel your ear.,7
I charge thee Satan housed within this man,7
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
O that thou wert not poor distressed soul!,7
You minion you are these your customers?,7
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,7
And I denied to enter in my house?,7
Where would you had remain'd until this time,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Sir sooth to say you did not dine at home.,7
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Sans fable she herself reviled you there.,7
Did not her kitchen-maid rail taunt and scorn me?,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,7
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?,7
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.,7
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.,7
By Dromio here who came in haste for it.,7
But surely master not a rag of money.,7
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?,7
And I am witness with her that she did.,7
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!,7
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?,7
And gentle master I received no gold;,7
Dissembling villain thou speak'st false in both.,7
Dissembling harlot thou art false in all;,7
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:,7
That would behold in me this shameful sport.,7
O bind him bind him! let him not come near me.,7
Ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks!,7
What will you murder me? Thou gaoler thou,7
To make a rescue?,7
He is my prisoner and you shall not have him.,7
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus,7
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man,7
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,7
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:,7
And knowing how the debt grows I will pay it.,7
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!,7
O most unhappy strumpet!,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad good master:,7
God help poor souls how idly do they talk!,7
Exeunt all but Adriana Luciana Officer and Courtezan,7
One Angelo a goldsmith: do you know him?,7
Two hundred ducats.,7
Due for a chain your husband had of him.,7
When as your husband all in rage to-day,7
The ring I saw upon his finger now--,7
It may be so but I did never see it.,7
I long to know the truth hereof at large.,7
God for thy mercy! they are loose again.,7
Let's call more help to have them bound again.,7
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse,7
I see these witches are afraid of swords.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.,7
no harm: you saw they speak us fair give us gold:,7
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of,7
turn witch.,7
I will not stay to-night for all the town;,7
Exeunt,7
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.,7
I am sorry sir that I have hinder'd you;,7
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.,7
Of very reverend reputation sir,7
Second to none that lives here in the city:,7
Speak softly; yonder as I think he walks.,7
Tis so; and that self chain about his neck,7
Good sir draw near to me I'll speak to him.,7
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;,7
With circumstance and oaths so to deny,7
Beside the charge the shame imprisonment,7
Who but for staying on our controversy,7
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?,7
I think I had; I never did deny it.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
These ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee.,7
To walk where any honest man resort.,7
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:,7
Against thee presently if thou darest stand.,7
They draw,7
Hold hurt him not for God's sake! he is mad.,7
Bind Dromio too and bear them to my house.,7
This is some priory. In or we are spoil'd!,7
Enter the Lady Abbess AEMILIA,7
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.,7
And bear him home for his recovery.,7
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.,7
This week he hath been heavy sour sad,7
But till this afternoon his passion,7
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?,7
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?,7
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.,7
To none of these except it be the last;,7
You should for that have reprehended him.,7
Ay but not rough enough.,7
Haply in private.,7
Ay but not enough.,7
In bed he slept not for my urging it;,7
Alone it was the subject of my theme;,7
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.,7
The venom clamours of a jealous woman,7
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,7
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:,7
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;,7
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:,7
But moody and dull melancholy,7
And at her heels a huge infectious troop,7
In food in sport and life-preserving rest,7
The consequence is then thy jealous fits,7
She never reprehended him but mildly,7
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?,7
Good people enter and lay hold on him.,7
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.,7
And it shall privilege him from your hands,7
Or lose my labour in assaying it.,7
Diet his sickness for it is my office,7
And therefore let me have him home with me.,7
Till I have used the approved means I have,7
To make of him a formal man again:,7
A charitable duty of my order.,7
I will not hence and leave my husband here:,7
To separate the husband and the wife.,7
Exit,7
Come go: I will fall prostrate at his feet,7
Have won his grace to come in person hither,7
By this I think the dial points at five:,7
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,7
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.,7
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,7
Against the laws and statutes of this town,7
See where they come: we will behold his death.,7
Enter DUKE SOLINUS attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers,7
If any friend will pay the sum for him,7
Justice most sacred duke against the abbess!,7
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.,7
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,7
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;,7
With him his bondman all as mad as he--,7
By rushing in their houses bearing thence,7
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,7
That here and there his fury had committed.,7
He broke from those that had the guard of him;,7
Each one with ireful passion with drawn swords,7
Chased us away; till raising of more aid,7
Into this abbey whither we pursued them:,7
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,7
Therefore most gracious duke with thy command,7
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,7
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,7
Go some of you knock at the abbey-gate,7
I will determine this before I stir.,7
O mistress mistress shift and save yourself!,7
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,7
And ever as it blazed they threw on him,7
My master preaches patience to him and the while,7
And sure unless you send some present help,7
Peace fool! thy master and his man are here,7
Mistress upon my life I tell you true;,7
He cries for you and vows if he can take you,7
Cry within,7
Come stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!,7
That he is borne about invisible:,7
And now he's there past thought of human reason.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Even for the service that long since I did thee,7
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood,7
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,7
Even in the strength and height of injury!,7
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
While she with harlots feasted in my house.,7
No my good lord: myself he and my sister,7
As this is false he burdens me withal!,7
But she tells to your highness simple truth!,7
In this the madman justly chargeth them.,7
My liege I am advised what I say,7
Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire,7
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:,7
Could witness it for he was with me then;,7
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,7
Our dinner done and he not coming thither,7
And in his company that gentleman.,7
That I this day of him received the chain,7
He did arrest me with an officer.,7
For certain ducats: he with none return'd,7
To go in person with me to my house.,7
My wife her sister and a rabble more,7
They brought one Pinch a hungry lean-faced villain,7
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,7
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,7
And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse,7
Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together,7
And in a dark and dankish vault at home,7
Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,7
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech,7
For these deep shames and great indignities.,7
That he dined not at home but was lock'd out.,7
He had my lord: and when he ran in here,7
Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine,7
After you first forswore it on the mart:,7
And then you fled into this abbey here,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:,7
And this is false you burden me withal.,7
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.,7
If he were mad he would not plead so coldly:,7
Denies that saying. Sirrah what say you?,7
He did and from my finger snatch'd that ring.,7
Tis true my liege; this ring I had of her.,7
As sure my liege as I do see your grace.,7
I think you are all mated or stark mad.,7
Most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word:,7
And pay the sum that may deliver me.,7
Is not your name sir call'd Antipholus?,7
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,7
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.,7
Ourselves we do remember sir by you;,7
You are not Pinch's patient are you sir?,7
I never saw you in my life till now.,7
And careful hours with time's deformed hand,7
But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice?,7
Neither.,7
No trust me sir nor I.,7
Ay sir but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a,7
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,7
In seven short years that here my only son,7
Though now this grained face of mine be hid,7
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,7
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,7
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
But seven years since in Syracusa boy,7
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.,7
The duke and all that know me in the city,7
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.,7
Have I been patron to Antipholus,7
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.,7
Most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd.,7
I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me.,7
And so of these. Which is the natural man,7
I sir am Dromio; command him away.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
O my old master! who hath bound him here?,7
And gain a husband by his liberty.,7
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia,7
O if thou be'st the same AEgeon speak,7
If I dream not thou art AEmilia:,7
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?,7
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;,7
By force took Dromio and my son from them,7
What then became of them I cannot tell,7
Why here begins his morning story right;,7
And these two Dromios one in semblance--,7
These are the parents to these children,7
Antipholus thou camest from Corinth first?,7
No sir not I; I came from Syracuse.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And I with him.,7
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,7
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?,7
I gentle mistress.,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
And this fair gentlewoman her sister here,7
To Luciana,7
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;,7
That is the chain sir which you had of me.,7
I think it be sir; I deny it not.,7
And you sir for this chain arrested me.,7
I sent you money sir to be your bail,7
No none by me.,7
This purse of ducats I received from you,7
I see we still did meet each other's man,7
And thereupon these errors are arose.,7
These ducats pawn I for my father here.,7
Sir I must have that diamond from you.,7
There take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.,7
To go with us into the abbey here,7
And all that are assembled in this place,7
Have suffer'd wrong go keep us company,7
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail,7
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.,7
And you the calendars of their nativity,7
After so long grief such festivity!,7
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse Antipholus of Ephesus Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus,7
ANTIPHOLUS,7
Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur.,7
He speaks to me. I am your master Dromio:,7
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.,7
There is a fat friend at your master's house,7
She now shall be my sister not my wife.,7
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.,7
Not I sir; you are my elder.,7
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.,7
We came into the world like brother and brother;,7
Exeunt,7
SCENE I. Rome. A street.,8
Before we proceed any further hear me speak.,8
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?,8
First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.,8
Let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price.,8
No more talking on't; let it be done: away away!,8
We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good.,8
would yield us but the superfluity while it were,8
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that,8
inventory to particularise their abundance; our,8
our pikes ere we become rakes: for the gods know I,8
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?,8
Consider you what services he has done for his country?,8
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud.,8
I say unto you what he hath done famously he did,8
content to say it was for his country he did it to,8
is even till the altitude of his virtue.,8
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.,8
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition.,8
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city,8
Come come.,8
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA,8
the people.,8
What work's my countrymen in hand? where go you,8
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have,8
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor,8
have strong arms too.,8
Will you undo yourselves?,8
I tell you friends most charitable care,8
Your suffering in this dearth you may as well,8
Against the Roman state whose course will on,8
Of more strong link asunder than can ever,8
The gods not the patricians make it and,8
You are transported by calamity,8
The helms o' the state who care for you like fathers,8
Care for us! True indeed! They ne'er cared for us,8
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury to,8
established against the rich and provide more,8
the poor. If the wars eat us not up they will; and,8
Either you must,8
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you,8
But since it serves my purpose I will venture,8
Well I'll hear it sir: yet you must not think to,8
you deliver.,8
Rebell'd against the belly thus accused it:,8
I' the midst o' the body idle and unactive,8
Like labour with the rest where the other instruments,8
And mutually participate did minister,8
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--,8
Sir I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,8
For look you I may make the belly smile,8
To the discontented members the mutinous parts,8
As you malign our senators for that,8
Your belly's answer? What!,8
The counsellor heart the arm our soldier,8
With other muniments and petty helps,8
What then?,8
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,8
Well what then?,8
What could the belly answer?,8
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--,8
Ye're long about it.,8
Your most grave belly was deliberate,8
True is it my incorporate friends' quoth he,8
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,8
Of the whole body: but if you do remember,8
Even to the court the heart to the seat o' the brain;,8
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins,8
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,8
Ay sir; well well.,8
See what I do deliver out to each,8
From me do back receive the flour of all,8
It was an answer: how apply you this?,8
And you the mutinous members; for examine,8
Touching the weal o' the common you shall find,8
But it proceeds or comes from them to you,8
You the great toe of this assembly?,8
For that being one o' the lowest basest poorest,8
Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run,8
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:,8
The one side must have bale.,8
Hail noble Marcius!,8
That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,8
We have ever your good word.,8
Beneath abhorring. What would you have you curs,8
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,8
Where foxes geese: you are no surer no,8
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is,8
And curse that justice did it.,8
Deserves your hate; and your affections are,8
Which would increase his evil. He that depends,8
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?,8
And call him noble that was now your hate,8
That in these several places of the city,8
Under the gods keep you in awe which else,8
For corn at their own rates; whereof they say,8
Hang 'em! They say!,8
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,8
and give out,8
And feebling such as stand not in their liking,8
grain enough!,8
And let me use my sword I'll make a quarry,8
As I could pick my lance.,8
For though abundantly they lack discretion,8
What says the other troop?,8
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,8
That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not,8
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,8
To break the heart of generosity,8
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,8
What is granted them?,8
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,8
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,8
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes,8
This is strange.,8
Enter a Messenger hastily,8
Here: what's the matter?,8
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent,8
Enter COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS,8
The Volsces are in arms.,8
Tullus Aufidius that will put you to 't.,8
And were I any thing but what I am,8
You have fought together.,8
Upon my party I'ld revolt to make,8
That I am proud to hunt.,8
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.,8
Sir it is;,8
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.,8
No Caius Marcius;,8
Ere stay behind this business.,8
Your company to the Capitol; where I know,8
[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.,8
Right worthy you priority.,8
[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!,8
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither,8
Your valour puts well forth: pray follow.,8
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?,8
When we were chosen tribunes for the people--,8
Nay. but his taunts.,8
Be-mock the modest moon.,8
Too proud to be so valiant.,8
Tickled with good success disdains the shadow,8
His insolence can brook to be commanded,8
Fame at the which he aims,8
Better be held nor more attain'd than by,8
Shall be the general's fault though he perform,8
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he,8
Besides if things go well,8
Of his demerits rob Cominius.,8
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.,8
To Marcius shall be honours though indeed,8
Let's hence and hear,8
More than his singularity he goes,8
Lets along.,8
SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.,8
So your opinion is Aufidius,8
And know how we proceed.,8
What ever have been thought on in this state,8
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone,8
I have the letter here; yes here it is.,8
They have press'd a power but it is not known,8
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,8
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,8
These three lead on this preparation,8
Consider of it.',8
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready,8
Nor did you think it folly,8
They needs must show themselves; which,8
It seem'd appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.,8
To take in many towns ere almost Rome,8
Noble Aufidius,8
Let us alone to guard Corioli:,8
Bring your army; but I think you'll find,8
O doubt not that;,8
Some parcels of their power are forth already,8
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,8
Till one can do no more.,8
And keep your honours safe!,8
Farewell.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA they set them down on two low stools and sew,8
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband I,8
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where,8
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when,8
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not,8
how honour would become such a person. that it was,8
renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek,8
war I sent him; from whence he returned his brows,8
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child,8
man.,8
Then his good report should have been my son; I,8
sincerely: had I a dozen sons each in my love,8
Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their,8
Enter a Gentlewoman,8
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.,8
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,8
As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him:,8
Come on you cowards! you were got in fear,8
With his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes,8
Or all or lose his hire.,8
Away you fool! it more becomes a man,8
When she did suckle Hector look'd not lovelier,8
At Grecian sword contemning. Tell Valeria,8
Exit Gentlewoman,8
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee,8
Enter VALERIA with an Usher and Gentlewoman,8
Sweet madam.,8
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.,8
faith. How does your little son?,8
He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than,8
O' my word the father's son: I'll swear'tis a,8
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a,8
butterfly: and when he caught it he let it go,8
comes and again; catched it again; or whether his,8
teeth and tear it; O I warrant it how he mammocked,8
One on 's father's moods.,8
A crack madam.,8
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.,8
Not out of doors!,8
Indeed no by your patience; I'll not over the,8
Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,8
I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with,8
Why I pray you?,8
You would be another Penelope: yet they say all,8
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric,8
pricking it for pity. Come you shall go with us.,8
In truth la go with me; and I'll tell you,8
O good madam there can be none yet.,8
him last night.,8
In earnest it's true; I heard a senator speak it.,8
whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of,8
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt,8
on mine honour; and so I pray go with us.,8
thing hereafter.,8
disease our better mirth.,8
Come good sweet lady. Prithee Virgilia turn thy,8
No at a word madam; indeed I must not. I wish,8
Well then farewell.,8
SCENE IV. Before Corioli.,8
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.,8
Tis done.,8
Say has our general met the enemy?,8
So the good horse is mine.,8
No I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will,8
How far off lie these armies?,8
Then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours.,8
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,8
They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls,8
No nor a man that fears you less than he,8
Drums afar off,8
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,8
Which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes;,8
Alarum afar off,8
There is Aufidius; list what work he makes,8
O they are at it!,8
Enter the army of the Volsces,8
Now put your shields before your hearts and fight,8
brave Titus:,8
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on my fellows:,8
And he shall feel mine edge.,8
All the contagion of the south light on you,8
Plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd,8
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,8
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!,8
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,8
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;,8
As they us to our trenches followed.,8
So now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:,8
Not for the fliers: mark me and do the like.,8
Fool-hardiness; not I.,8
MARCIUS is shut in,8
To the pot I warrant him.,8
Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS,8
Slain sir doubtless.,8
With them he enters; who upon the sudden,8
To answer all the city.,8
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,8
A carbuncle entire as big as thou art,8
Even to Cato's wish not fierce and terrible,8
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,8
Were feverous and did tremble.,8
Look sir.,8
Let's fetch him off or make remain alike.,8
SCENE V. Corioli. A street.,8
This will I carry to Rome.,8
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.,8
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet,8
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions leaden spoons,8
Bury with those that wore them these base slaves,8
And hark what noise the general makes! To him!,8
Piercing our Romans: then valiant Titus take,8
Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste,8
Worthy sir thou bleed'st;,8
A second course of fight.,8
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:,8
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus,8
Now the fair goddess Fortune,8
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,8
Thy friend no less,8
Thou worthiest Marcius!,8
Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;,8
Where they shall know our mind: away!,8
SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.,8
Breathe you my friends: well fought;,8
Like Romans neither foolish in our stands,8
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,8
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!,8
That both our powers with smiling,8
May give you thankful sacrifice.,8
Thy news?,8
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:,8
And then I came away.,8
Methinks thou speak'st not well.,8
Above an hour my lord.,8
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,8
Spies of the Volsces,8
Three or four miles about else had I sir,8
Who's yonder,8
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have,8
[Within]                 Come I too late?,8
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue,8
Enter MARCIUS,8
Ay if you come not in the blood of others,8
O let me clip ye,8
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,8
Flower of warriors,8
As with a man busied about decrees:,8
Ransoming him or pitying threatening the other;,8
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,8
Where is that slave,8
Where is he? call him hither.,8
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,8
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge,8
But how prevail'd you?,8
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?,8
Marcius,8
Retire to win our purpose.,8
They have placed their men of trust?,8
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,8
Their very heart of hope.,8
By all the battles wherein we have fought,8
We have made to endure friends that you directly,8
And that you not delay the present but,8
We prove this very hour.,8
You were conducted to a gentle bath,8
Deny your asking: take your choice of those,8
Those are they,8
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting,8
Lesser his person than an ill report;,8
And that his country's dearer than himself;,8
Wave thus to express his disposition,8
They all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps,8
If these shows be not outward which of you,8
Able to bear against the great Aufidius,8
Though thanks to all must I select,8
Shall bear the business in some other fight,8
And four shall quickly draw out my command,8
March on my fellows:,8
Divide in all with us.,8
SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.,8
So let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,8
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve,8
We cannot keep the town.,8
Hence and shut your gates upon's.,8
Exeunt,8
Alarum as in battle. Enter from opposite sides MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS,8
Worse than a promise-breaker.,8
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor,8
Let the first budger die the other's slave,8
If I fly Marcius,8
Within these three hours Tullus,8
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood,8
Wrench up thy power to the highest.,8
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,8
They fight and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless,8
In your condemned seconds.,8
SCENE IX. The Roman camp.,8
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,8
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,8
I' the end admire where ladies shall be frighted,8
dull tribunes,8
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods,8
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,8
Enter TITUS LARTIUS with his power from the pursuit,8
Here is the steed we the caparison:,8
Pray now no more: my mother,8
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done,8
As you have been; that's for my country:,8
Hath overta'en mine act.,8
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know,8
Worse than a theft no less than a traducement,8
Which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,8
In sign of what you are not to reward,8
I have some wounds upon me and they smart,8
Should they not,8
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,8
The treasure in this field achieved and city,8
Before the common distribution at,8
I thank you general;,8
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;,8
That have beheld the doing.,8
May these same instruments which you profane,8
I' the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be,8
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,8
No more I say! For that I have not wash'd,8
Which without note here's many else have done--,8
In acclamations hyperbolical;,8
In praises sauced with lies.,8
More cruel to your good report than grateful,8
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you,8
Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,8
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,8
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,8
With all the applause and clamour of the host,8
The addition nobly ever!,8
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!,8
And when my face is fair you shall perceive,8
I mean to stride your steed and at all times,8
To the fairness of my power.,8
Where ere we do repose us we will write,8
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome,8
For their own good and ours.,8
The gods begin to mock me. I that now,8
Of my lord general.,8
I sometime lay here in Corioli,8
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;,8
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you,8
O well begg'd!,8
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him Titus.,8
By Jupiter! forgot.,8
Have we no wine here?,8
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time,8
Exeunt,8
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody with two or three Soldiers,8
Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.,8
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,8
What good condition can a treaty find,8
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,8
As often as we eat. By the elements,8
He's mine or I am his: mine emulation,8
I thought to crush him in an equal force,8
Or wrath or craft may get him.,8
Bolder though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd,8
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,8
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,8
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst,8
At home upon my brother's guard even there,8
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;,8
Be hostages for Rome.,8
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--,8
How the world goes that to the pace of it,8
I shall sir.,8
ACT II,8
Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people SICINIUS and BRUTUS.,8
Good or bad?,8
love not Marcius.,8
Pray you who does the wolf love?,8
Ay to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the,8
He's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear.,8
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.,8
In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two,8
He's poor in no one fault but stored with all.,8
And topping all others in boasting.,8
censured here in the city I mean of us o' the,8
Why how are we censured?,8
Well well sir well.,8
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:,8
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a,8
being proud?,8
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps,8
single: your abilities are too infant-like for,8
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,8
O that you could!,8
Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,8
any in Rome.,8
I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that,8
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in,8
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more,8
of the morning: what I think I utter and spend my,8
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink,8
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have,8
compound with the major part of your syllables: and,8
you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that,8
the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known,8
conspectuities glean out of this character if I be,8
Come sir come we know you well enough.,8
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you,8
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;,8
second day of audience. When you are hearing a,8
pinched with the colic you make faces like,8
patience; and in roaring for a chamber-pot,8
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their,8
a pair of strange ones.,8
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary,8
Our very priests must become mockers if they shall,8
you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the,8
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's,8
saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud;,8
since Deucalion though peradventure some of the,8
your worships: more of your conversation would,8
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.,8
Enter VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA and VALERIA,8
were she earthly no nobler--whither do you follow,8
Honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches; for,8
Ha! Marcius coming home!,8
approbation.,8
Marcius coming home!,8
Look here's a letter from him: the state hath,8
at home for you.,8
me!,8
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven,8
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in,8
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he,8
O no no no.,8
So do I too if it be not too much: brings a',8
On's brows: Menenius he comes the third time home,8
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?,8
Aufidius got off.,8
an he had stayed by him I would not have been so,8
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?,8
has letters from the general wherein he gives my,8
action outdone his former deeds doubly,8
Wondrous! ay I warrant you and not without his,8
The gods grant them true!,8
True! I'll be sworn they are true.,8
To the Tribunes,8
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?,8
large cicatrices to show the people when he shall,8
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.,8
nine that I know.,8
wounds upon him.,8
A shout and flourish,8
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he,8
Death that dark spirit in 's nervy arm doth lie;,8
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general and TITUS LARTIUS; between them CORIOLANUS  crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers and a Herald,8
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,8
In honour follows Coriolanus.,8
Flourish,8
No more of this; it does offend my heart:,8
Look sir your mother!,8
You have I know petition'd all the gods,8
Kneels,8
My gentle Marcius worthy Caius and,8
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--,8
My gracious silence hail!,8
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay my dear,8
And mothers that lack sons.,8
And live you yet?,8
O my sweet lady pardon.,8
And welcome general: and ye're welcome all.,8
And I could laugh I am light and heavy. Welcome.,8
That is not glad to see thee! You are three,8
We have some old crab-trees here,8
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome warriors:,8
The faults of fools but folly.,8
Menenius ever ever.,8
[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand and yours:,8
The good patricians must be visited;,8
But with them change of honours.,8
To see inherited my very wishes,8
There's one thing wanting which I doubt not but,8
Know good mother,8
Than sway with them in theirs.,8
Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward,8
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse,8
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins,8
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls bulks windows,8
With variable complexions all agreeing,8
Do press among the popular throngs and puff,8
Commit the war of white and damask in,8
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother,8
Were slily crept into his human powers,8
On the sudden,8
Then our office may,8
He cannot temperately transport his honours,8
Lose those he hath won.,8
Doubt not,8
Upon their ancient malice will forget,8
That he will give them make I as little question,8
I heard him swear,8
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put,8
Nor showing as the manner is his wounds,8
Tis right.,8
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,8
I wish no better,8
In execution.,8
It shall be to him then as our good wills,8
So it must fall out,8
We must suggest the people in what hatred,8
Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and,8
In human action and capacity,8
Than camels in the war who have their provand,8
For sinking under them.,8
At some time when his soaring insolence,8
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy,8
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze,8
Enter a Messenger,8
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought,8
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and,8
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,8
As to Jove's statue and the commons made,8
I never saw the like.,8
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,8
Have with you.,8
SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.,8
Come come they are almost here. How many stand,8
Three they say: but 'tis thought of every one,8
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and,8
Faith there had been many great men that have,8
be many that they have loved they know not,8
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore for,8
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their,8
them plainly see't.,8
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither,8
devotion than can render it him; and leaves,8
opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and,8
dislikes to flatter them for their love.,8
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,8
bonneted without any further deed to have them at,8
planted his honours in their eyes and his actions,8
silent and not confess so much were a kind of,8
malice that giving itself the lie would pluck,8
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way they,8
A sennet. Enter with actors before them COMINIUS  the consul MENENIUS CORIOLANUS Senators  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands,8
To send for Titus Lartius it remains,8
To gratify his noble service that,8
please you,8
The present consul and last general,8
A little of that worthy work perform'd,8
We met here both to thank and to remember,8
Speak good Cominius:,8
Rather our state's defective for requital,8
To the Tribunes,8
We do request your kindest ears and after,8
To yield what passes here.,8
Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts,8
The theme of our assembly.,8
We shall be blest to do if he remember,8
He hath hereto prized them at.,8
I would you rather had been silent. Please you,8
Most willingly;,8
Than the rebuke you give it.,8
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.,8
CORIOLANUS offers to go away,8
Sit Coriolanus; never shame to hear,8
Your horror's pardon:,8
Than hear say how I got them.,8
My words disbench'd you not.,8
When blows have made me stay I fled from words.,8
your people,8
Pray now sit down.,8
When the alarum were struck than idly sit,8
Exit,8
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--,8
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour,8
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus,8
That valour is the chiefest virtue and,8
The man I speak of cannot in the world,8
When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought,8
Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight,8
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid,8
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,8
When he might act the woman in the scene,8
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age,8
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since,8
Before and in Corioli let me say,8
And by his rare example made the coward,8
A vessel under sail so men obey'd,8
Where it did mark it took; from face to foot,8
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd,8
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,8
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:,8
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit,8
And to the battle came he; where he did,8
Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd,8
To ease his breast with panting.,8
He cannot but with measure fit the honours,8
Our spoils he kick'd at,8
The common muck of the world: he covets less,8
His deeds with doing them and is content,8
He's right noble:,8
Call Coriolanus.,8
Re-enter CORIOLANUS,8
To make thee consul.,8
My life and services.,8
That you do speak to the people.,8
Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot,8
For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage: please you,8
Sir the people,8
One jot of ceremony.,8
Pray you go fit you to the custom and,8
Your honour with your form.,8
That I shall blush in acting and might well,8
Mark you that?,8
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,8
Of their breath only!,8
We recommend to you tribunes of the people,8
Wish we all joy and honour.,8
Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS,8
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,8
Should be in them to give.,8
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,8
Exeunt,8
Enter seven or eight Citizens,8
We may sir if we will.,8
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us,8
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so if,8
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is,8
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the,8
monstrous members.,8
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn he,8
We have been called so of many; not that our heads,8
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and,8
one skull they would fly east west north south,8
once to all the points o' the compass.,8
fly?,8
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head but,8
Why that way?,8
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return,8
You are never without your tricks: you may you may.,8
that's no matter the greater part carries it. I,8
never a worthier man.,8
Here he comes and in the gown of humility: mark his,8
come by him where he stands by ones by twos and,8
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single,8
tongues: therefore follow me and I direct you how,8
Content content.,8
O sir you are not right: have you not known,8
What must I say?,8
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look sir my wounds!,8
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran,8
O me the gods!,8
To think upon you.,8
I would they would forget me like the virtues,8
You'll mar all:,8
In wholesome manner.,8
Bid them wash their faces,8
Re-enter two of the Citizens,8
Re-enter a third Citizen,8
We do sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.,8
Your own desert!,8
How not your own desire?,8
poor with begging.,8
gain by you.,8
The price is to ask it kindly.,8
show you which shall be yours in private. Your,8
You shall ha' it worthy sir.,8
begged. I have your alms: adieu.,8
An 'twere to give again--but 'tis no matter.,8
Re-enter two other Citizens,8
voices that I may be consul I have here the,8
You have deserved nobly of your country and you,8
Your enigma?,8
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved,8
You should account me the more virtuous that I have,8
sworn brother the people to earn a dearer,8
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is,8
the insinuating nod and be off to them most,8
bewitchment of some popular man and give it,8
I may be consul.,8
you our voices heartily.,8
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I,8
The gods give you joy sir heartily!,8
Most sweet voices!,8
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.,8
To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear,8
What custom wills in all things should we do't,8
And mountainous error be too highly heapt,8
Let the high office and the honour go,8
The one part suffer'd the other will I do.,8
Here come more voices.,8
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear,8
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have,8
Indeed I would be consul.,8
man's voice.,8
and make him good friend to the people!,8
Exeunt,8
Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS,8
Endue you with the people's voice: remains,8
Anon do meet the senate.,8
The custom of request you have discharged:,8
To meet anon upon your approbation.,8
There Coriolanus.,8
You may sir.,8
Repair to the senate-house.,8
We stay here for the people.,8
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS,8
Tis warm at 's heart.,8
will you dismiss the people?,8
How now my masters! have you chose this man?,8
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.,8
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.,8
He flouted us downright.,8
Not one amongst us save yourself but says,8
His marks of merit wounds received for's country.,8
No no; no man saw 'em.,8
in private;,8
I would be consul' says he: 'aged custom,8
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,8
Your most sweet voices: now you have left,8
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?,8
Or seeing it of such childish friendliness,8
Could you not have told him,8
But was a petty servant to the state,8
Your liberties and the charters that you bear,8
A place of potency and sway o' the state,8
Fast foe to the plebeii your voices might,8
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less,8
Would think upon you for your voices and,8
Standing your friendly lord.,8
As you were fore-advised had touch'd his spirit,8
Either his gracious promise which you might,8
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,8
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,8
And pass'd him unelected.,8
He did solicit you in free contempt,8
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,8
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry,8
Have you,8
Of him that did not ask but mock bestow,8
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.,8
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.,8
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends,8
Their liberties; make them of no more voice,8
As therefore kept to do so.,8
And on a safer judgment all revoke,8
And his old hate unto you; besides forget not,8
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,8
The apprehension of his present portance,8
After the inveterate hate he bears you.,8
A fault on us your tribunes; that we laboured,8
Cast your election on him.,8
More after our commandment than as guided,8
Preoccupied with what you rather must do,8
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.,8
How youngly he began to serve his country,8
The noble house o' the Marcians from whence came,8
Who after great Hostilius here was king;,8
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;,8
Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,8
One thus descended,8
To be set high in place we did commend,8
Scaling his present bearing with his past,8
Your sudden approbation.,8
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;,8
Repair to the Capitol.,8
Repent in their election.,8
Let them go on;,8
Than stay past doubt for greater:,8
With their refusal both observe and answer,8
To the Capitol come:,8
And this shall seem as partly 'tis their own,8
Exeunt,8
SCENE I. Rome. A street.,8
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?,8
Our swifter composition.,8
Ready when time shall prompt them to make road.,8
They are worn lord consul so,8
Their banners wave again.,8
On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curse,8
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.,8
He did my lord.,8
How often he had met you sword to sword;,8
Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes,8
Be call'd your vanquisher.,8
At Antium.,8
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.,8
Behold these are the tribunes of the people,8
For they do prank them in authority,8
Pass no further.,8
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.,8
The matter?,8
Cominius no.,8
Tribunes give way; he shall to the market-place.,8
Stop,8
Are these your herd?,8
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are,8
You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth?,8
Be calm be calm.,8
To curb the will of the nobility:,8
Nor ever will be ruled.,8
The people cry you mock'd them and of late,8
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them,8
Why this was known before.,8
Have you inform'd them sithence?,8
You are like to do such business.,8
Each way to better yours.,8
Let me deserve so ill as you and make me,8
You show too much of that,8
To where you are bound you must inquire your way,8
Or never be so noble as a consul,8
Let's be calm.,8
Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus,8
I' the plain way of his merit.,8
This was my speech and I will speak't again--,8
Not in this heat sir now.,8
I crave their pardons:,8
Regard me as I do not flatter and,8
In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate,8
Which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd,8
By mingling them with us the honour'd number,8
Which they have given to beggars.,8
No more words we beseech you.,8
As for my country I have shed my blood,8
Coin words till their decay against those measles,8
The very way to catch them.,8
As if you were a god to punish not,8
Twere well,8
What what? his choler?,8
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,8
It is a mind,8
Not poison any further.,8
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you,8
Twas from the canon.,8
O good but most unwise patricians! why,8
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,8
The horn and noise o' the monster's wants not spirit,8
And make your channel his? If he have power,8
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,8
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,8
When both your voices blended the great'st taste,8
And such a one as he who puts his 'shall',8
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!,8
To know when two authorities are up,8
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take,8
Well on to the market-place.,8
The corn o' the storehouse gratis as 'twas used,8
Well well no more of that.,8
I say they nourish'd disobedience fed,8
Why shall the people give,8
I'll give my reasons,8
Was not our recompense resting well assured,8
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,8
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war,8
Most valour spoke not for them: the accusation,8
All cause unborn could never be the motive,8
How shall this bisson multitude digest,8
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;,8
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase,8
Call our cares fears; which will in time,8
The crows to peck the eagles.,8
Enough with over-measure.,8
What may be sworn by both divine and human,8
Where one part does disdain with cause the other,8
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no,8
Real necessities and give way the while,8
it follows,8
You that will be less fearful than discreet,8
More than you doubt the change on't that prefer,8
To jump a body with a dangerous physic,8
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick,8
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state,8
Not having the power to do the good it would,8
Has said enough.,8
As traitors do.,8
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?,8
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,8
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,8
And throw their power i' the dust.,8
This a consul? no.,8
Enter an AEdile,8
Go call the people:,8
in whose name myself,8
A foe to the public weal: obey I charge thee,8
Hence old goat!,8
Aged sir hands off.,8
Out of thy garments.,8
Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians) with the AEdiles,8
Here's he that would take from you all your power.,8
Down with him! down with him!,8
They all bustle about CORIOLANUS crying,8
Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!',8
What is about to be? I am out of breath;,8
To the people! Coriolanus patience!,8
Hear me people; peace!,8
You are at point to lose your liberties:,8
Whom late you have named for consul.,8
This is the way to kindle not to quench.,8
What is the city but the people?,8
The people are the city.,8
The people's magistrates.,8
And so are like to do.,8
To bring the roof to the foundation,8
In heaps and piles of ruin.,8
Or let us stand to our authority,8
Upon the part o' the people in whose power,8
Of present death.,8
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian and from thence,8
AEdiles seize him!,8
Hear me one word;,8
Peace peace!,8
country's friend,8
Thus violently redress.,8
That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous,8
And bear him to the rock.,8
Drawing his sword,8
Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me.,8
Lay hands upon him.,8
You that be noble; help him young and old!,8
In this mutiny the Tribunes the AEdiles and the People are beat in,8
All will be naught else.,8
Stand fast;,8
Sham it be put to that?,8
I prithee noble friend home to thy house;,8
For 'tis a sore upon us,8
Come sir along with us.,8
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,8
Be gone;,8
One time will owe another.,8
I could beat forty of them.,8
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea the,8
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;,8
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,8
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear,8
Pray you be gone:,8
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd,8
Nay come away.,8
This man has marr'd his fortune.,8
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,8
What his breast forges that his tongue must vent;,8
He heard the name of death.,8
Here's goodly work!,8
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!,8
Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS with the rabble,8
That would depopulate the city and,8
You worthy tribunes--,8
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,8
Than the severity of the public power,8
He shall well know,8
And we their hands.,8
Sir sir--,8
Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt,8
Sir how comes't that you,8
Hear me speak:,8
So can I name his faults--,8
The consul Coriolanus.,8
No no no no no.,8
I may be heard I would crave a word or two;,8
Than so much loss of time.,8
For we are peremptory to dispatch,8
Were but one danger and to keep him here,8
He dies to-night.,8
That our renowned Rome whose gratitude,8
In Jove's own book like an unnatural dam,8
He's a disease that must be cut away.,8
Mortal to cut it off; to cure it easy.,8
Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost--,8
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;,8
Were to us all that do't and suffer it,8
This is clean kam.,8
It honour'd him.,8
Being once gangrened is not then respected,8
We'll hear no more.,8
Lest his infection being of catching nature,8
One word more one word.,8
The harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late,8
Lest parties as he is beloved break out,8
If it were so--,8
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?,8
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars,8
In bolted language; meal and bran together,8
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him,8
In peace to his utmost peril.,8
It is the humane way: the other course,8
Unknown to the beginning.,8
Be you then as the people's officer.,8
Go not home.,8
Where if you bring not Marcius we'll proceed,8
I'll bring him to you.,8
Let me desire your company: he must come,8
Pray you let's to him.,8
SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.,8
Let them puff all about mine ears present me,8
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,8
Below the beam of sight yet will I still,8
You do the nobler.,8
Does not approve me further who was wont,8
To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads,8
When one but of my ordinance stood up,8
Enter VOLUMNIA,8
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me,8
The man I am.,8
I would have had you put your power well on,8
Let go.,8
With striving less to be so; lesser had been,8
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed,8
Let them hang.,8
Enter MENENIUS and Senators,8
too rough;,8
There's no remedy;,8
Cleave in the midst and perish.,8
I have a heart as little apt as yours,8
To better vantage.,8
Before he should thus stoop to the herd but that,8
For the whole state I would put mine armour on,8
What must I do?,8
Well what then? what then?,8
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;,8
You are too absolute;,8
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,8
I' the war do grow together: grant that and tell me,8
That they combine not there.,8
A good demand.,8
The same you are not which for your best ends,8
That it shall hold companionship in peace,8
It stands in like request?,8
Because that now it lies you on to speak,8
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,8
Your tongue though but bastards and syllables,8
Now this no more dishonours you at all,8
Which else would put you to your fortune and,8
I would dissemble with my nature where,8
I should do so in honour: I am in this,8
And you will rather show our general louts,8
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard,8
Noble lady!,8
Not what is dangerous present but the loss,8
I prithee now my son,8
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--,8
Action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant,8
Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,8
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,8
Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess,8
In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame,8
As thou hast power and person.,8
Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours;,8
As words to little purpose.,8
Go and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather,8
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.,8
I have been i' the market-place; and sir'tis fit,8
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.,8
I think 'twill serve if he,8
He must and will,8
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?,8
A lie that it must bear? Well I will do't:,8
This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it,8
You have put me now to such a part which never,8
Come come we'll prompt you.,8
My praises made thee first a soldier so,8
Thou hast not done before.,8
Away my disposition and possess me,8
Which quired with my drum into a pipe,8
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves,8
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue,8
Who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his,8
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,8
A most inherent baseness.,8
To beg of thee it is my more dishonour,8
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear,8
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list,8
But owe thy pride thyself.,8
Mother I am going to the market-place;,8
Cog their hearts from them and come home beloved,8
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;,8
I' the way of flattery further.,8
Exit,8
To answer mildly; for they are prepared,8
Than are upon you yet.,8
Let them accuse me by invention I,8
Ay but mildly.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS,8
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,8
And that the spoil got on the Antiates,8
Enter an AEdile,8
He's coming.,8
With old Menenius and those senators,8
Have you a catalogue,8
Set down by the poll?,8
Have you collected them by tribes?,8
Assemble presently the people hither;,8
I' the right and strength o' the commons' be it either,8
If I say fine cry 'Fine;' if death cry 'Death.',8
And power i' the truth o' the cause.,8
And when such time they have begun to cry,8
Enforce the present execution,8
Very well.,8
When we shall hap to give 't them.,8
Exit AEdile,8
Ever to conquer and to have his worth,8
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks,8
With us to break his neck.,8
Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS and COMINIUS with Senators and Patricians,8
Ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece,8
Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice,8
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,8
Amen amen.,8
Re-enter AEdile with Citizens,8
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace I say!,8
Well say. Peace ho!,8
Must all determine here?,8
If you submit you to the people's voices,8
To suffer lawful censure for such faults,8
I am content.,8
The warlike service he has done consider; think,8
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.,8
Scars to move laughter only.,8
That when he speaks not like a citizen,8
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,8
Rather than envy you.,8
What is the matter,8
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour,8
Answer to us.,8
We charge you that you have contrived to take,8
Yourself into a power tyrannical;,8
How! traitor!,8
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!,8
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,8
Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say,8
As I do pray the gods.,8
To the rock to the rock with him!,8
We need not put new matter to his charge:,8
Beating your officers cursing yourselves,8
Those whose great power must try him; even this,8
Deserves the extremest death.,8
Served well for Rome--,8
I talk of that that know it.,8
Is this the promise that you made your mother?,8
I know no further:,8
Vagabond exile raying pent to linger,8
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;,8
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.',8
As much as in him lies from time to time,8
To pluck away their power as now at last,8
Of dreaded justice but on the ministers,8
And in the power of us the tribunes we,8
In peril of precipitation,8
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,8
It shall be so it shall be so; let him away:,8
Hear me my masters and my common friends--,8
Let me speak:,8
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love,8
More holy and profound than mine own life,8
And treasure of my loins; then if I would,8
We know your drift: speak what?,8
As enemy to the people and his country:,8
It shall be so it shall be so.,8
As reek o' the rotten fens whose loves I prize,8
That do corrupt my air I banish you;,8
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!,8
Fan you into despair! Have the power still,8
Your ignorance which finds not till it feels,8
Still your own foes deliver you as most,8
That won you without blows! Despising,8
There is a world elsewhere.,8
The people's enemy is gone is gone!,8
Shouting and throwing up their caps,8
As he hath followed you with all despite;,8
Attend us through the city.,8
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.,8
ACT IV,8
Enter CORIOLANUS VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA MENENIUS COMINIUS with the young Nobility of Rome,8
With many heads butts me away. Nay mother,8
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;,8
That when the sea was calm all boats alike,8
When most struck home being gentle wounded craves,8
With precepts that would make invincible,8
O heavens! O heavens!,8
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,8
What what what!,8
Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,8
Six of his labours you'ld have done and saved,8
Droop not; adieu. Farewell my wife my mother:,8
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,8
I have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld,8
Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,8
My hazards still have been your solace: and,8
Like to a lonely dragon that his fen,8
Will or exceed the common or be caught,8
My first son.,8
With thee awhile: determine on some course,8
That starts i' the way before thee.,8
I'll follow thee a month devise with thee,8
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth,8
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,8
I' the absence of the needer.,8
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full,8
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.,8
My friends of noble touch when I am forth,8
While I remain above the ground you shall,8
But what is like me formerly.,8
As any ear can hear. Come let's not weep.,8
From these old arms and legs by the good gods,8
Give me thy hand: Come.,8
SCENE II. The same. A  street near the gate.,8
Bid them all home; he's gone and we'll no further.,8
In his behalf.,8
Let us seem humbler after it is done,8
Bid them home:,8
Stand in their ancient strength.,8
Exit AEdile,8
Let's not meet her.,8
They say she's mad.,8
Enter VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA and MENENIUS,8
Requite your love!,8
If that I could for weeping you should hear--,8
To BRUTUS,8
[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power,8
Are  you mankind?,8
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship,8
Than thou hast spoken words?,8
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;,8
Nay but thou shalt stay too: I would my son,8
His good sword in his hand.,8
What then!,8
Bastards and all.,8
Come come peace.,8
As he began and not unknit himself,8
I would he had.,8
Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth,8
Will not have earth to know.,8
Now pray sir get you gone:,8
As far as doth the Capitol exceed,8
This lady's husband here this do you see--,8
Well well we'll leave you.,8
With one that wants her wits?,8
Exeunt Tribunes,8
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em,8
Of what lies heavy to't.,8
And by my troth you have cause. You'll sup with me?,8
And so shall starve with feeding. Come let's go:,8
In anger Juno-like. Come come come.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter a Roman and a Volsce meeting,8
me: your name I think is Adrian.,8
I am a Roman; and my services are,8
Nicanor? no.,8
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your,8
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,8
day's journey.,8
people against the senators patricians and nobles.,8
so: they are in a most warlike preparation and,8
The main blaze of it is past but a small thing,8
so to heart the banishment of that worthy,8
all power from the people and to pluck from them,8
tell you and is almost mature for the violent,8
Coriolanus banished!,8
You will be welcome with this intelligence Nicanor.,8
said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is,8
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars his,8
of his country.,8
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my,8
I shall between this and supper tell you most,8
their adversaries. Have you an army ready say you?,8
distinctly billeted already in the entertainment,8
I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the,8
So sir heartily well met and most glad of your company.,8
to be glad of yours.,8
Exeunt,8
Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel disguised and muffled,8
Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir,8
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,8
In puny battle slay me.,8
Save you sir.,8
Direct me if it be your will,8
He is and feasts the nobles of the state,8
Which is his house beseech you?,8
Thank you sir: farewell.,8
O world thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,8
Whose house whose bed whose meal and exercise,8
Unseparable shall within this hour,8
To bitterest enmity: so fellest foes,8
To take the one the other by some chance,8
And interjoin their issues. So with me:,8
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,8
I'll do his country service.,8
SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.,8
Wine wine wine! What service,8
Exit,8
Where's Cotus? my master calls,8
Exit,8
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I,8
Re-enter the first Servingman,8
Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.,8
I have deserved no better entertainment,8
Re-enter second Servingman,8
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?,8
Away!,8
Now thou'rt troublesome.,8
Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him,8
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him,8
Retires,8
the house.,8
What are you?,8
A marvellous poor one.,8
Pray you poor gentleman take up some other,8
Follow your function go and batten on cold bits.,8
What you will not? Prithee tell my master what a,8
And I shall.,8
Where dwellest thou?,8
Under the canopy!,8
Where's that?,8
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!,8
No I serve not thy master.,8
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy,8
trencher hence!,8
Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman,8
Here sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog but for,8
Retires,8
Why speak'st not? speak man: what's thy name?,8
Unmuffling,8
Think me for the man I am necessity,8
What is thy name?,8
And harsh in sound to thine.,8
Thou hast a grim appearance and thy face,8
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?,8
thou me yet?,8
My name is Caius Marcius who hath done,8
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may,8
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood,8
But with that surname; a good memory,8
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;,8
Permitted by our dastard nobles who,8
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be,8
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--,8
I had fear'd death of all the men i' the world,8
To be full quit of those my banishers,8
A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge,8
Of shame seen through thy country speed,8
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it,8
As benefits to thee for I will fight,8
Of all the under fiends. But if so be,8
Thou'rt tired then in a word I also am,8
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;,8
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,8
And cannot live but to thy shame unless,8
O Marcius Marcius!,8
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter,8
And say 'Tis true' I'ld not believe them more,8
Mine arms about that body where against,8
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip,8
As hotly and as nobly with thy love,8
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,8
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,8
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw,8
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose,8
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out,8
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;,8
Unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat,8
Had we no quarrel else to Rome but that,8
From twelve to seventy and pouring war,8
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O come go in,8
Who now are here taking their leaves of me,8
Though not for Rome itself.,8
Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have,8
The one half of my commission; and set down--,8
Thy country's strength and weakness--thine own ways;,8
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,8
Let me commend thee first to those that shall,8
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;,8
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward,8
By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with,8
false report of him.,8
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top.,8
him: he had sir a kind of face methought--I,8
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,8
So did I I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest,8
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.,8
Nay it's no matter for that.,8
Nay not so neither: but I take him to be the,8
Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that:,8
Ay and for an assault too.,8
O slaves I can tell you news-- news you rascals!,8
I would not be a Roman of all nations; I had as,8
Wherefore? wherefore?,8
Caius Marcius.,8
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always,8
Come we are fellows and friends: he was ever too,8
He was too hard for him directly to say the troth,8
him like a carbon ado.,8
broiled and eaten him too.,8
Why he is so made on here within as if he were son,8
question asked him by any of the senators but they,8
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and,8
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i',8
yesterday; for the other has half by the entreaty,8
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he,8
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.,8
many friends as enemies; which friends sir as it,8
we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude.,8
But when they shall see sir his crest up again,8
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with,8
But when goes this forward?,8
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis as it were a,8
wipe their lips.,8
This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase,8
Let me have war say I; it exceeds peace as far as,8
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy;,8
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.,8
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a,8
Ay and it makes men hate one another.,8
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap,8
In in in in!,8
SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.,8
We hear not of him neither need we fear him;,8
And quietness of the people which before,8
Blush that the world goes well who rather had,8
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see,8
About their functions friendly.,8
Enter MENENIUS,8
Tis he'tis he: O he is grown most kind of late.,8
Hail to you both!,8
Is not much miss'd but with his friends:,8
Were he more angry at it.,8
He could have temporized.,8
Nay I hear nothing: his mother and his wife,8
Enter three or four Citizens,8
God-den our neighbours.,8
Ourselves our wives and children on our knees,8
Live and thrive!,8
Had loved you as we did.,8
Farewell farewell.,8
This is a happier and more comely time,8
Crying confusion.,8
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,8
Self-loving--,8
Without assistance.,8
We should by this to all our lamentation,8
The gods have well prevented it and Rome,8
Enter an AEdile,8
There is a slave whom we have put in prison,8
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,8
Destroy what lies before 'em.,8
Who hearing of our Marcius' banishment,8
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,8
Come what talk you,8
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be,8
Cannot be!,8
And three examples of the like have been,8
Before you punish him where he heard this,8
And beat the messenger who bids beware,8
Tell not me:,8
Not possible.,8
The nobles in great earnestness are going,8
That turns their countenances.,8
Go whip him 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;,8
Yes worthy sir,8
More fearful is deliver'd.,8
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--,8
Join'd with Aufidius leads a power 'gainst Rome,8
The young'st and oldest thing.,8
Raised only that the weaker sort may wish,8
The very trick on't.,8
He and Aufidius can no more atone,8
Enter a second Messenger,8
A fearful army led by Caius Marcius,8
Upon our territories; and have already,8
What lay before them.,8
O you have made good work!,8
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and,8
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses--,8
Your temples burned in their cement and,8
Into an auger's bore.,8
You have made fair work I fear me.--Pray your news?--,8
If!,8
Made by some other deity than nature,8
Against us brats with no less confidence,8
Or butchers killing flies.,8
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much,8
The breath of garlic-eaters!,8
Your Rome about your ears.,8
Did shake down mellow fruit.,8
But is this true sir?,8
Before you find it other. All the regions,8
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,8
Your enemies and his find something in him.,8
The noble man have mercy.,8
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people,8
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends if they,8
As those should do that had deserved his hate,8
Tis true:,8
That should consume it I have not the face,8
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!,8
A trembling upon Rome such as was never,8
Say not we brought it.,8
And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters,8
But I fear,8
The second name of men obeys his points,8
Is all the policy strength and defence,8
Enter a troop of Citizens,8
And is Aufidius with him? You are they,8
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at,8
And not a hair upon a soldier's head,8
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,8
if he could burn us all into one coal,8
Faith we hear fearful news.,8
When I said banish him I said 'twas pity.,8
And so did I; and to say the truth so did very,8
though we willingly consented to his banishment yet,8
Ye re goodly things you voices!,8
Good work you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?,8
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS,8
These are a side that would be glad to have,8
And show no sign of fear.,8
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished,8
So did we all. But come let's home.,8
I do not like this news.,8
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth,8
Pray let us go.,8
SCENE VII. A camp at a small distance from Rome.,8
Do they still fly to the Roman?,8
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,8
And you are darken'd in this action sir,8
I cannot help it now,8
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,8
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature,8
What cannot be amended.,8
I mean for your particular--you had not,8
Had borne the action of yourself or else,8
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,8
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,8
To the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly.,8
Fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon,8
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,8
Sir I beseech you think you he'll carry Rome?,8
And the nobility of Rome are his:,8
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people,8
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome,8
By sovereignty of nature. First he was,8
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,8
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,8
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,8
From the casque to the cushion but commanding peace,8
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--,8
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,8
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues,8
And power unto itself most commendable,8
To extol what it hath done.,8
Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail.,8
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.,8
ACT V,8
Enter MENENIUS COMINIUS SICINIUS BRUTUS and others,8
Which was sometime his general; who loved him,8
But what o' that? Go you that banish'd him;,8
The way into his mercy: nay if he coy'd,8
He would not seem to know me.,8
Yet one time he did call me by my name:,8
That we have bled together. Coriolanus,8
He was a kind of nothing titleless,8
Of burning Rome.,8
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,8
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon,8
It was a bare petition of a state,8
Very well:,8
I offer'd to awaken his regard,8
He could not stay to pick them in a pile,8
For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt,8
For one poor grain or two!,8
And this brave fellow too we are the grains:,8
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.,8
In this so never-needed help yet do not,8
Would be your country's pleader your good tongue,8
Might stop our countryman.,8
Pray you go to him.,8
Only make trial what your love can do,8
Well and say that Marcius,8
Unheard; what then?,8
With his unkindness? say't be so?,8
must have that thanks from Rome after the measure,8
I'll undertake 't:,8
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.,8
The veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then,8
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd,8
With wine and feeding we have suppler souls,8
Till he be dieted to my request,8
You know the very road into his kindness,8
Good faith I'll prove him,8
Of my success.,8
He'll never hear him.,8
I tell you he does sit in gold his eye,8
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;,8
Thus with his speechless hand: what he would do,8
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:,8
Unless his noble mother and his wife;,8
For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,8
Exeunt,8
Two Sentinels on guard.,8
Stay: whence are you?,8
You guard like men; 'tis well: but by your leave,8
To speak with Coriolanus.,8
From Rome.,8
Will no more hear from thence.,8
You'll speak with Coriolanus.,8
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,8
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.,8
Is not here passable.,8
The general is my lover: I have been,8
His name unparallel'd haply amplified;,8
Of whom he's chief with all the size that verity,8
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,8
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore fellow,8
Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his,8
should not pass here; no though it were as virtuous,8
Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius,8
Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you,8
say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.,8
speak with him till after dinner.,8
I am as thy general is.,8
when you have pushed out your gates the very,8
ignorance given your enemy your shield think to,8
women the virginal palms of your daughters or with,8
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the,8
such weak breath as this? No you are deceived;,8
execution: you are condemned our general has sworn,8
Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would,8
Come my captain knows you not.,8
My general cares not for you. Back I say go; lest,8
the utmost of your having: back.,8
Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS,8
Now you companion I'll say an errand for you:,8
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from,8
with him if thou standest not i' the state of,8
spectatorship and crueller in suffering; behold now,8
To CORIOLANUS,8
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than,8
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee here's,8
thee; but being assured none but myself could move,8
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy,8
wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet,8
access to thee.,8
How! away!,8
Are servanted to others: though I owe,8
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,8
Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.,8
Your gates against my force. Yet for I loved thee,8
Gives a letter,8
I will not hear thee speak. This man Aufidius,8
You keep a constant temper.,8
Now sir is your name Menenius?,8
way home again.,8
greatness back?,8
I neither care for the world nor your general: for,8
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by,8
do his worst. For you be that you are long; and,8
as I was said to Away!,8
A noble fellow I warrant him.,8
oak not to be wind-shaken.,8
SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.,8
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow,8
You must report to the Volscian lords how plainly,8
Only their ends,8
The general suit of Rome; never admitted,8
That thought them sure of you.,8
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,8
Nay godded me indeed. Their latest refuge,8
Though I show'd sourly to him once more offer'd,8
And cannot now accept; to grace him only,8
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,8
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?,8
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow,8
Enter in mourning habits VIRGILIA VOLUMNIA leading young MARCIUS VALERIA and Attendants,8
Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand,8
All bond and privilege of nature break!,8
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,8
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;,8
In supplication nod: and my young boy,8
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces,8
Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand,8
And knew no other kin.,8
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.,8
Makes you think so.,8
I have forgot my part and I am out,8
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,8
Long as my exile sweet as my revenge!,8
I carried from thee dear; and my true lip,8
And the most noble mother of the world,8
Kneels,8
Than that of common sons.,8
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint,8
Show duty as mistaken all this while,8
Kneels,8
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?,8
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds,8
Murdering impossibility to make,8
Thou art my warrior;,8
The noble sister of Publicola,8
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,8
This is a poor epitome of yours,8
May show like all yourself.,8
With the consent of supreme Jove inform,8
To shame unvulnerable and stick i' the wars,8
And saving those that eye thee!,8
That's my brave boy!,8
Are suitors to you.,8
Or if you'ld ask remember this before:,8
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me,8
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not,8
To ally my rages and revenges with,8
O no more no more!,8
For we have nothing else to ask but that,8
That if you fail in our request the blame,8
Aufidius and you Volsces mark; for we'll,8
Should we be silent and not speak our raiment,8
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself,8
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,8
Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance,8
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;,8
The son the husband and the father tearing,8
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us,8
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,8
Whereto we are bound together with thy victory,8
The country our dear nurse or else thy person,8
An evident calamity though we had,8
Must as a foreign recreant be led,8
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,8
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself son,8
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee,8
Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner,8
Trust to't thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,8
Ay and mine,8
Living to time.,8
I'll run away till I am bigger but then I'll fight.,8
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.,8
Rising,8
If it were so that our request did tend,8
The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us,8
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces,8
This we received;' and each in either side,8
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st great son,8
That if thou conquer Rome the benefit,8
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;,8
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;,8
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me son:,8
To imitate the graces of the gods;,8
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt,8
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man,8
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou boy:,8
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world,8
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life,8
When she poor hen fond of no second brood,8
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,8
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,8
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:,8
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride,8
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,8
This boy that cannot tell what he would have,8
Does reason our petition with more strength,8
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;,8
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:,8
And then I'll speak a little.,8
O mother mother!,8
The gods look down and this unnatural scene,8
You have won a happy victory to Rome;,8
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,8
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars,8
Were you in my stead would you have heard,8
I was moved withal.,8
And sir it is no little thing to make,8
What peace you'll make advise me: for my part,8
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!,8
thy honour,8
Myself a former fortune.,8
Ay by and by;,8
But we will drink together; and you shall bear,8
On like conditions will have counter-seal'd.,8
To have a temple built you: all the swords,8
Could not have made this peace.,8
SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.,8
See you yond coign o' the Capitol yond,8
Why what of that?,8
little finger there is some hope the ladies of,8
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are,8
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the,8
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;,8
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a,8
He loved his mother dearly.,8
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness,8
moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before,8
his eye; talks like a knell and his hum is a,8
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with,8
and a heaven to throne in.,8
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his,8
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that,8
you.,8
No in such a case the gods will not be good unto,8
and he returning to break our necks they respect not us.,8
Sir if you'ld save your life fly to your house:,8
And hale him up and down all swearing if,8
They'll give him death by inches.,8
What's the news?,8
The Volscians are dislodged and Marcius gone:,8
No not the expulsion of the Tarquins.,8
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?,8
Where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it?,8
As the recomforted through the gates. Why hark you!,8
The trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes,8
Make the sun dance. Hark you!,8
This is good news:,8
Is worth of consuls senators patricians,8
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:,8
I'd not have given a doit. Hark how they joy!,8
First the gods bless you for your tidings; next,8
Sir we have all,8
They are near the city?,8
We will meet them,8
Exeunt,8
Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA  VALERIA  and c. passing over the stage followed by Patricians and others,8
Call all your tribes together praise the gods,8
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,8
Cry 'Welcome ladies welcome!',8
A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt,8
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with Attendants,8
Deliver them this paper: having read it,8
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,8
The city ports by this hath enter'd and,8
To purge herself with words: dispatch.,8
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction,8
How is it with our general?,8
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,8
Most noble sir,8
You wish'd us parties we'll deliver you,8
Sir I cannot tell:,8
The people will remain uncertain whilst,8
Makes the survivor heir of all.,8
And my pretext to strike at him admits,8
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,8
Seducing so my friends; and to this end,8
But to be rough unswayable and free.,8
When he did stand for consul which he lost,8
That I would have spoke of:,8
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;,8
In all his own desires; nay let him choose,8
My best and freshest men; served his designments,8
Which he did end all his; and took some pride,8
I seem'd his follower not partner and,8
I had been mercenary.,8
The army marvell'd at it and in the last,8
For no less spoil than glory--,8
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.,8
As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour,8
And I'll renew me in his fall. But hark!,8
Your native town you enter'd like a post,8
Splitting the air with noise.,8
Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear,8
Therefore at your vantage,8
With what he would say let him feel your sword,8
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury,8
Say no more:,8
Enter the Lords of the city,8
I have not deserved it.,8
What I have written to you?,8
And grieve to hear't.,8
Might have found easy fines: but there to end,8
The benefit of our levies answering us,8
There was a yielding--this admits no excuse.,8
Enter CORIOLANUS marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him,8
No more infected with my country's love,8
Under your great command. You are to know,8
With bloody passage led your wars even to,8
Do more than counterpoise a full third part,8
With no less honour to the Antiates,8
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,8
We have compounded on.,8
But tell the traitor in the high'st degree,8
Traitor! how now!,8
Marcius!,8
I'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name,8
You lords and heads o' the state perfidiously,8
For certain drops of salt your city Rome,8
Breaking his oath and resolution like,8
Counsel o' the war but at his nurse's tears,8
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart,8
Hear'st thou Mars?,8
Ha!,8
Measureless liar thou hast made my heart,8
Pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever,8
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--,8
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join,8
Peace both and hear me speak.,8
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!,8
That like an eagle in a dove-cote I,8
Alone I did it. Boy!,8
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,8
Fore your own eyes and ears?,8
Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd,8
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.',8
The man is noble and his fame folds-in,8
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand Aufidius,8
O that I had him,8
To use my lawful sword!,8
Kill kill kill kill kill him!,8
Hold hold hold hold!,8
O Tullus--,8
Tread not upon him. Masters all be quiet;,8
My lords when you shall know--as in this rage,8
Which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice,8
To call me to your senate I'll deliver,8
Your heaviest censure.,8
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded,8
Did follow to his urn.,8
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.,8
My rage is gone;,8
Help three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.,8
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he,8
Which to this hour bewail the injury,8
Exeunt bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded,8
SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.,9
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods,9
Still seem as does the king.,9
His daughter and the heir of's kingdom whom,9
That late he married--hath referr'd herself,9
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all,9
Be touch'd at very heart.,9
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,9
Although they wear their faces to the bent,9
Glad at the thing they scowl at.,9
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing,9
I mean that married her alack good man!,9
As to seek through the regions of the earth,9
In him that should compare. I do not think,9
Endows a man but he.,9
I do extend him sir within himself,9
His measure duly.,9
I cannot delve him to the root: his father,9
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,9
He served with glory and admired success,9
And had besides this gentleman in question,9
Died with their swords in hand; for which,9
Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow,9
Big of this gentleman our theme deceased,9
To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus,9
Puts to him all the learnings that his time,9
As we do air fast as 'twas minister'd,9
Which rare it is to do--most praised most loved,9
A glass that feated them and to the graver,9
For whom he now is banish'd her own price,9
By her election may be truly read,9
I honour him,9
Is she sole child to the king?,9
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,9
I' the swathing-clothes the other from their nursery,9
Which way they went.,9
Some twenty years.,9
So slackly guarded and the search so slow,9
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,9
Yet is it true sir.,9
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,9
Exeunt,9
No be assured you shall not find me daughter,9
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner but,9
That lock up your restraint. For you Posthumus,9
I will be known your advocate: marry yet,9
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience,9
Please your highness,9
You know the peril.,9
The pangs of barr'd affections though the king,9
Exit,9
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant,9
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--,9
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;,9
Of angry eyes not comforted to live,9
That I may see again.,9
O lady weep no more lest I give cause,9
Than doth become a man. I will remain,9
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,9
Known but by letter: thither write my queen,9
Though ink be made of gall.,9
Be brief I pray you:,9
How much of his displeasure.,9
Yet I'll move him,9
But he does buy my injuries to be friends;,9
Exit,9
As long a term as yet we have to live,9
Nay stay a little:,9
Such parting were too petty. Look here love;,9
But keep it till you woo another wife,9
How how! another?,9
And sear up my embracements from a next,9
Putting on the ring,9
While sense can keep it on. And sweetest fairest,9
To your so infinite loss so in our trifles,9
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it,9
Putting a bracelet upon her arm,9
When shall we see again?,9
Alack the king!,9
If after this command thou fraught the court,9
Thou'rt poison to my blood.,9
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.,9
There cannot be a pinch in death,9
O disloyal thing,9
A year's age on me.,9
Harm not yourself with your vexation,9
Subdues all pangs all fears.,9
Past hope and in despair; that way past grace.,9
O blest that I might not! I chose an eagle,9
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne,9
No; I rather added,9
O thou vile one!,9
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:,9
A man worth any woman overbuys me,9
What art thou mad?,9
A neat-herd's daughter and my Leonatus,9
Thou foolish thing!,9
They were again together: you have done,9
And pen her up.,9
Dear lady daughter peace! Sweet sovereign,9
Out of your best advice.,9
A drop of blood a day; and being aged,9
Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords,9
Enter PISANIO,9
My lord your son drew on my master.,9
No harm I trust is done?,9
But that my master rather play'd than fought,9
By gentlemen at hand.,9
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.,9
I would they were in Afric both together;,9
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?,9
To bring him to the haven; left these notes,9
When 't pleased you to employ me.,9
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour,9
I humbly thank your highness.,9
About some half-hour hence,9
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.,9
SCENE II. The same. A public place.,9
Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt; the,9
sacrifice: where air comes out air comes in:,9
If my shirt were bloody then to shift it. Have I hurt him?,9
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass if he be,9
[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the,9
The villain would not stand me.,9
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but,9
[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!,9
[Aside]  So would I till you had measured how long,9
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!,9
is damned.,9
go not together: she's a good sign but I have seen,9
[Aside]  She shines not upon fools lest the,9
Come I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some,9
[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall,9
You'll go with us?,9
Nay come let's go together.,9
Exeunt,9
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO,9
And question'dst every sail: if he should write,9
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last,9
It was his queen his queen!,9
And kiss'd it madam.,9
And that was all?,9
As he could make me with this eye or ear,9
The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief,9
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,9
Thou shouldst have made him,9
To after-eye him.,9
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them but,9
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,9
The smallness of a gnat to air and then,9
When shall we hear from him?,9
With his next vantage.,9
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him,9
Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear,9
Mine interest and his honour or have charged him,9
To encounter me with orisons for then,9
Give him that parting kiss which I had set,9
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north,9
Enter a Lady,9
Desires your highness' company.,9
I will attend the queen.,9
Exeunt,9
Enter PHILARIO IACHIMO a Frenchman a Dutchman and a Spaniard,9
then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy,9
could then have looked on him without the help of,9
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.,9
he is with that which makes him both without and within.,9
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.,9
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,9
And then his banishment.,9
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully,9
which else an easy battery might lay flat for,9
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps,9
His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I,9
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained,9
knowing to a stranger of his quality.,9
I beseech you all be better known to this,9
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear,9
Sir we have known together in Orleans.,9
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.,9
did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity,9
purpose as then each bore upon importance of so,9
By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller;,9
my every action to be guided by others' experiences:,9
it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.,9
and by such two that would by all likelihood have,9
Can we with manners ask what was the difference?,9
which may without contradiction suffer the report.,9
night where each of us fell in praise of our,9
vouching--and upon warrant of bloody,9
chaste constant-qualified and less attemptable,9
That lady is not now living or this gentleman's,9
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.,9
Being so far provoked as I was in France I would,9
adorer not her friend.,9
comparison--had been something too fair and too good,9
I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres,9
excelled many: but I have not seen the most,9
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.,9
More than the world enjoys.,9
outprized by a trifle.,9
there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit,9
and only the gift of the gods.,9
Which by their graces I will keep.,9
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your,9
estimations; the one is but frail and the other,9
courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last.,9

Let us leave here gentlemen.,9

No no.,9

What's that?,9

let it die as it was born and I pray you be,9
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the,9
What lady would you choose to assail?,9
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,9
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a,9
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.,9
I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.,9
ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot,9

graver purpose I hope.,9
what's spoken I swear.,9

unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.,9
By the gods it is one. If I bring you no,9
bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats,9
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,9
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more,9
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles,9

your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she,9
otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you,9

Agreed.,9
Will this hold think you?,9
Pray let us follow 'em.,9
SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.,9
Whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers;,9
I madam.,9
Exeunt Ladies,9
Pleaseth your highness ay: here they are madam:,9
But I beseech your grace without offence--,9
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,9
But though slow deadly?,9
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been,9
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea so,9
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded--,9
That I did amplify my judgment in,9
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as,9
To try the vigour of them and apply,9
Their several virtues and effects.,9
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:,9
Both noisome and infectious.,9
Enter PISANIO,9
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him,9
An enemy to my son. How now Pisanio!,9
Take your own way.,9
But you shall do no harm.,9
[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has,9
And will not trust one of her malice with,9
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;,9
cats and dogs,9
No danger in what show of death it makes,9
To be more fresh reviving. She is fool'd,9
So to be false with her.,9
Until I send for thee.,9
Exit,9
She will not quench and let instructions enter,9
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,9
As great as is thy master greater for,9
Is at last gasp: return he cannot nor,9
Is to exchange one misery with another,9
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,9
Who cannot be new built nor has no friends,9
The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up,9
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:,9
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know,9
It is an earnest of a further good,9
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.,9
Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son,9
To any shape of thy preferment such,9
That set thee on to this desert am bound,9
Think on my words.,9
A sly and constant knave,9
And the remembrancer of her to hold,9
Which if he take shall quite unpeople her,9
Except she bend her humour shall be assured,9
Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies,9
The violets cowslips and the primroses,9
Think on my words.,9
And shall do:,9
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.,9
SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.,9
A father cruel and a step-dame false;,9
That hath her husband banish'd;--O that husband!,9
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,9
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,9
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!,9
Madam a noble gentleman of Rome,9
Change you madam?,9
And greets your highness dearly.,9
Thanks good sir:,9
[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!,9
She is alone the Arabian bird and I,9
Arm me audacity from head to foot!,9
Rather directly fly.,9
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon,9
LEONATUS.',9
But even the very middle of my heart,9
You are as welcome worthy sir as I,9
In all that I can do.,9
What are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes,9
Of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt,9
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not,9
Twixt fair and foul?,9
It cannot be i' the eye for apes and monkeys,9
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,9
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;,9
Should make desire vomit emptiness,9
What is the matter trow?,9
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub,9
Longs after for the garbage.,9
Thus raps you? Are you well?,9
To PISANIO,9
My man's abode where I did leave him: he,9
I was going sir,9
Exit,9
Well madam.,9
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there,9
The Briton reveller.,9
He did incline to sadness and oft-times,9
I never saw him sad.,9
An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves,9
The thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton--,9
Can my sides hold to think that man who knows,9
What woman is yea what she cannot choose,9
Assured bondage?',9
Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter:,9
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know,9
Not he I hope.,9
Be used more thankfully. In himself 'tis much;,9
Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound,9
What do you pity sir?,9
Am I one sir?,9
Deserves your pity?,9
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace,9
I pray you sir,9
To my demands. Why do you pity me?,9
I was about to say--enjoy your--But,9
Not mine to speak on 't.,9
Something of me or what concerns me: pray you--,9
Than to be sure they do; for certainties,9
The remedy then born--discover to me,9
Had I this cheek,9
Whose every touch would force the feeler's soul,9
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,9
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs,9
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood as,9
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light,9
That all the plagues of hell should at one time,9
My lord I fear,9
And himself. Not I,9
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces,9
Charms this report out.,9
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart,9
So fair and fasten'd to an empery,9
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition,9
That play with all infirmities for gold,9
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;,9
Recoil from your great stock.,9
How should I be revenged? If this be true--,9
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,9
Should he make me,9
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,9
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,9
And will continue fast to your affection,9
What ho Pisanio!,9
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have,9
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not,9
Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far,9
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains,9
The king my father shall be made acquainted,9
A saucy stranger in his court to mart,9
His beastly mind to us he hath a court,9
He not respects at all. What ho Pisanio!,9
The credit that thy lady hath of thee,9
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!,9
Country call'd his! and you his mistress only,9
I have spoke this to know if your affiance,9
That which he is new o'er: and he is one,9
That he enchants societies into him;,9
You make amends.,9
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,9
Most mighty princess that I have adventured,9
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment,9
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him,9
Unlike all others chaffless. Pray your pardon.,9
for yours.,9
To entreat your grace but in a small request,9
Your lord; myself and other noble friends,9
Pray what is't?,9
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums,9
Which I the factor for the rest have done,9
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;,9
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you,9
Willingly;,9
My lord hath interest in them I will keep them,9
They are in a trunk,9
To send them to you only for this night;,9
O no no.,9
By lengthening my return. From Gallia,9
To see your grace.,9
But not away to-morrow!,9
Therefore I shall beseech you if you please,9
I have outstood my time; which is material,9
I will write.,9
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.,9
ACT II,9
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords,9
jack upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a,9
must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine,9
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with,9
[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,9
When a gentleman is disposed to swear it is not for,9
No my lord;,9
nor crop the ears of them.,9
Would he had been one of my rank!,9
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a,9
they dare not fight with me because of the queen my,9
fighting and I must go up and down like a cock that,9
[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,9
Sayest thou?,9
companion that you give offence to.,9
offence to my inferiors.,9
Why so I say.,9
A stranger and I not know on't!,9
not.,9
Leonatus' friends.,9
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?,9
Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no,9
You cannot derogate my lord.,9
[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore your,9
Come I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost,9
I'll attend your lordship.,9
That such a crafty devil as is his mother,9
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son,9
And leave eighteen. Alas poor princess,9
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,9
More hateful than the foul expulsion is,9
Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm,9
That temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand,9
Exit,9
a trunk in one corner of it.,9
Who's there? my woman Helen?,9
What hour is it?,9
I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:,9
Take not away the taper leave it burning;,9
I prithee call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly,9
To your protection I commend me gods.,9
Guard me beseech ye.,9
The crickets sing and man's o'er-labour'd sense,9
Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd,9
How bravely thou becomest thy bed fresh lily,9
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,9
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper,9
To see the enclosed lights now canopied,9
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,9
Such and such pictures; there the window; such,9
Why such and such; and the contents o' the story.,9
Above ten thousand meaner moveables,9
O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her!,9
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off come off:,9
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!,9
As strongly as the conscience does within,9
A mole cinque-spotted like the crimson drops,9
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret,9
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?,9
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late,9
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:,9
Swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning,9
Though this a heavenly angel hell is here.,9
One two three: time time!,9
An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.,9
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss the,9
It would make any man cold to lose.,9
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.,9
get this foolish Imogen I should have gold enough.,9
Day my lord.,9
her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.,9
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your,9
will do let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.,9
after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich,9
SONG,9
And Phoebus 'gins arise,9
On chaliced flowers that lies;,9
To ope their golden eyes:,9
My lady sweet arise:,9
So get you gone. If this penetrate I will,9
a vice in her ears which horse-hairs and,9
boot can never amend.,9
Here comes the king.,9
was up so early: he cannot choose but take this,9
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN,9
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?,9
I have assailed her with music but she vouchsafes no notice.,9
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time,9
And then she's yours.,9
Who lets go by no vantages that may,9
To orderly soliciting and be friended,9
Increase your services; so seem as if,9
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,9
And therein you are senseless.,9
Enter a Messenger,9
The one is Caius Lucius.,9
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;,9
According to the honour of his sender;,9
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,9
Attend the queen and us; we shall have need,9
Exeunt all but CLOTEN,9
Let her lie still and dream.,9
By your leave ho!,9
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold,9
Diana's rangers false themselves yield up,9
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;,9
Can it not do and undo? I will make,9
I yet not understand the case myself.,9
By your leave.,9
Who's there that knocks?,9
No more?,9
That's more,9
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?,9
Ay,9
There is gold for you;,9
How! my good name? or to report of you,9
Enter IMOGEN,9
Exit Lady,9
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give,9
And scarce can spare them.,9
If you but said so 'twere as deep with me:,9
That I regard it not.,9
But that you shall not say I yield being silent,9
I shall unfold equal discourtesy,9
Should learn being taught forbearance.,9
I will not.,9
Do you call me fool?,9
If you'll be patient I'll no more be mad;,9
You put me to forget a lady's manners,9
That I which know my heart do here pronounce,9
And am so near the lack of charity--,9
You felt than make't my boast.,9
Obedience which you owe your father. For,9
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,9
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--,9
On whom there is no more dependency,9
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by,9
The precious note of it with a base slave.,9
A pantler not so eminent.,9
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more,9
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,9
Comparative for your virtues to be styled,9
For being preferred so well.,9
He never can meet more mischance than come,9
That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer,9
Were they all made such men. How now Pisanio!,9
His garment!' Now the devil--,9
His garment!',9
Frighted and anger'd worse: go bid my woman,9
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,9
Of any king's in Europe. I do think,9
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:,9
That I kiss aught but he.,9
I hope so: go and search.,9
You have abused me:,9
Ay I said so sir:,9
I will inform your father.,9
She's my good lady and will conceive I hope,9
To the worst of discontent.,9
I'll be revenged:,9
Exit,9
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.,9
Fear it not sir: I would I were so sure,9
Will remain hers.,9
Not any but abide the change of time,9
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,9
I must die much your debtor.,9
O'erpays all I can do. By this your king,9
Will do's commission throughly: and I think,9
Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance,9
I do believe,9
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear,9
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings,9
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar,9
their courage,9
Now mingled with their courages will make known,9
That mend upon the world.,9
See! Iachimo!,9
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,9
Welcome sir.,9
The speediness of your return.,9
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.,9
Look through a casement to allure false hearts,9
Here are letters for you.,9
Tis very like.,9
When you were there?,9
But not approach'd.,9
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not,9
If I had lost it,9
I'll make a journey twice as far to enjoy,9
Was mine in Britain for the ring is won.,9
Not a whit,9
Make not sir,9
Must not continue friends.,9
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought,9
We were to question further: but I now,9
Together with your ring; and not the wronger,9
By both your wills.,9
That you have tasted her in bed my hand,9
You had of her pure honour gains or loses,9
To who shall find them.,9
Being so near the truth as I will make them,9
I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not,9
You need it not.,9
First her bedchamber--,9
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd,9
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman,9
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work,9
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd,9
Since the true life on't was--,9
And this you might have heard of here by me,9
More particulars,9
So they must,9
The chimney,9
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures,9
Was as another nature dumb; outwent her,9
This is a thing,9
Being as it is much spoke of.,9
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--,9
Of silver each on one foot standing nicely,9
This is her honour!,9
Be given to your remembrance--the description,9
The wager you have laid.,9
Showing the bracelet,9
And now 'tis up again: it must be married,9
Jove!,9
Which I left with her?,9
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;,9
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me and said,9
May be she pluck'd it off,9
She writes so to you doth she?,9
Gives the ring,9
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour,9
Where there's another man: the vows of women,9
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.,9
Have patience sir,9
It may be probable she lost it; or,9
Hath stol'n it from her?,9
And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring:,9
More evident than this; for this was stolen.,9
Hark you he swears; by Jupiter he swears.,9
She would not lose it: her attendants are,9
And by a stranger!--No he hath enjoyed her:,9
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore,9
There take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell,9
Sir be patient:,9
Of one persuaded well of--,9
She hath been colted by him.,9
For further satisfying under her breast--,9
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,9
To feed again though full. You do remember,9
Ay and it doth confirm,9
Were there no more but it.,9
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;,9
I'll be sworn--,9
If you will swear you have not done't you lie;,9
Thou'st made me cuckold.,9
O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!,9
Her father. I'll do something--,9
Quite besides,9
Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath,9
With an my heart.,9
SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.,9
Is there no way for men to be but women,9
And that most venerable man which I,9
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools,9
The Dian of that time so doth my wife,9
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,9
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't,9
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O all the devils!,9
Or less--at first?--perchance he spoke not but,9
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition,9
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out,9
That tends to vice in man but I affirm,9
The woman's; flattering hers; deceiving hers;,9
Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain,9
All faults that may be named nay that hell knows,9
For even to vice,9
One vice but of a minute old for one,9
Detest them curse them: yet 'tis greater skill,9
The very devils cannot plague them better.,9
ACT III,9
Enter in state CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN  and Lords at one door and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants,9
When Julius Caesar whose remembrance yet,9
Be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain,9
Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less,9
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,9
Is left untender'd.,9
Shall be so ever.,9
Ere such another Julius. Britain is,9
For wearing our own noses.,9
Which then they had to take from 's to resume,9
The kings your ancestors together with,9
As Neptune's park ribbed and paled in,9
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,9
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag,9
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried,9
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,9
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof,9
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,9
And Britons strut with courage.,9
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,9
them may have crook'd noses but to owe such,9
Son let your mother end.,9
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a,9
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or,9
for light; else sir no more tribute pray you now.,9
Till the injurious Romans did extort,9
Caesar's ambition,9
The sides o' the world against all colour here,9
Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon,9
We do.,9
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which,9
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise,9
Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,9
His brows within a golden crown and call'd,9
I am sorry Cymbeline,9
Caesar that hath more kings his servants than,9
Receive it from me then: war and confusion,9
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,9
Thou art welcome Caius.,9
Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;,9
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect,9
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent,9
So Caesar shall not find them.,9
His majesty bids you welcome. Make,9
you seek us afterwards in other terms you,9
beat us out of it it is yours; if you fall in,9
for you; and there's an end.,9
I know your master's pleasure and he mine:,9
Exeunt,9
Enter PISANIO with a letter,9
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,9
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,9
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:,9
More goddess-like than wife-like such assaults,9
Thy mind to her is now as low as were,9
Upon the love and truth and vows which I,9
If it be so to do good service never,9
That I should seem to lack humanity,9
Reading,9
that I have sent her by her own command,9
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,9
So virgin-like without? Lo here she comes.,9
Enter IMOGEN,9
Madam here is a letter from my lord.,9
O learn'd indeed were that astronomer,9
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,9
Of my lord's health of his content yet not,9
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,9
All but in that! Good wax thy leave. Blest be,9
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:,9
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news gods!,9
Justice and your father's wrath should he take me,9
you O the dearest of creatures would even renew me,9
at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of,9
happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your,9
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.',9
He is at Milford-Haven: read and tell me,9
May plod it in a week why may not I,9
Who long'st like me to see thy lord; who long'st--,9
But in a fainter kind:--O not like me;,9
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,9
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way,9
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,9
That we shall make in time from our hence-going,9
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?,9
How many score of miles may we well ride,9
One score 'twixt sun and sun,9
Aside,9
Why one that rode to's execution man,9
riding wagers,9
That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:,9
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently,9
A franklin's housewife.,9
I see before me man: nor here nor here,9
That I cannot look through. Away I prithee;,9
Accessible is none but Milford way.,9
SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.,9
A goodly day not to keep house with such,9
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you,9
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through,9
Good morrow to the sun. Hail thou fair heaven!,9
As prouder livers do.,9
Hail heaven!,9
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,9
That it is place which lessens and sets off;,9
Of courts of princes of the tricks in war:,9
But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,9
And often to our comfort shall we find,9
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O this life,9
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,9
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,9
Out of your proof you speak: we poor unfledged,9
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,9
That have a sharper known; well corresponding,9
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;,9
To stride a limit.,9
When we are old as you? when we shall hear,9
In this our pinching cave shall we discourse,9
We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey,9
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage,9
And sing our bondage freely.,9
Did you but know the city's usuries,9
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb,9
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,9
I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i',9
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph,9
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,9
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd,9
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,9
Was not far off: then was I as a tree,9
A storm or robbery call it what you will,9
And left me bare to weather.,9
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--,9
Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline,9
Follow'd my banishment and this twenty years,9
Where I have lived at honest freedom paid,9
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!,9
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;,9
And we will fear no poison which attends,9
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
These boys know little they are sons to the king;,9
They think they are mine; and though train'd,9
I' the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit,9
In simple and low things to prince it much,9
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain who,9
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell,9
Into my story: say 'Thus mine enemy fell,9
The princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats,9
That acts my words. The younger brother Cadwal,9
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more,9
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows,9
At three and two years old I stole these babes;,9
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,9
their mother,9
Myself Belarius that am Morgan call'd,9
Exit,9
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN,9
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so,9
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,9
From the inward of thee? One but painted thus,9
Beyond self-explication: put thyself,9
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?,9
A look untender? If't be summer news,9
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!,9
And he's at some hard point. Speak man: thy tongue,9
Would be even mortal to me.,9
And you shall find me wretched man a thing,9
[Reads]  'Thy mistress Pisanio hath played the,9
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,9
as I expect my revenge. That part thou Pisanio,9
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away,9
Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose,9
it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and,9
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper,9
Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue,9
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie,9
Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave,9
False to his bed! What is it to be false?,9
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep,9
To break it with a fearful dream of him,9
Alas good lady!,9
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;,9
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,9
Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion;,9
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,9
By thy revolt O husband shall be thought,9
But worn a bait for ladies.,9
True honest men being heard like false Aeneas,9
Did scandal many a holy tear took pity,9
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;,9
From thy great fall. Come fellow be thou honest:,9
A little witness my obedience: look!,9
The innocent mansion of my love my heart;,9
Thy master is not there who was indeed,9
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;,9
Hence vile instrument!,9
Why I must die;,9
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter,9
That cravens my weak hand. Come here's my heart.,9
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?,9
All turn'd to heresy? Away away,9
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools,9
are betray'd,9
Stands in worse case of woe.,9
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father,9
Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find,9
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself,9
That now thou tirest on how thy memory,9
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?,9
When I desire it too.,9
Since I received command to do this business,9
Do't and to bed then.,9
Wherefore then,9
So many miles with a pretence? this place?,9
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,9
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,9
The elected deer before thee?,9
To lose so bad employment; in the which,9
Hear me with patience.,9
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear,9
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.,9
I thought you would not back again.,9
Bringing me here to kill me.,9
But if I were as wise as honest then,9
But that my master is abused:,9
Hath done you both this cursed injury.,9
No on my life.,9
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded,9
And that will well confirm it.,9
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?,9
Dead to my husband?,9
No court no father; nor no more ado,9
That Cloten whose love-suit hath been to me,9
If not at court,9
Where then,9
Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume,9
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee think,9
I am most glad,9
Lucius the Roman comes to Milford-Haven,9
Dark as your fortune is and but disguise,9
But by self-danger you should tread a course,9
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least,9
Report should render him hourly to your ear,9
O for such means!,9
I would adventure.,9
You must forget to be a woman; change,9
The handmaids of all women or more truly,9
Ready in gibes quick-answer'd saucy and,9
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,9
Alack no remedy!--to the greedy touch,9
Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein,9
Nay be brief,9
A man already.,9
Fore-thinking this I have already fit--,9
That answer to them: would you in their serving,9
From youth of such a season 'fore noble Lucius,9
wherein you're happy--which you'll make him know,9
With joy he will embrace you for he's honourable,9
You have me rich; and I will never fail,9
Thou art all the comfort,9
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even,9
I am soldier to and will abide it with,9
Well madam we must take a short farewell,9
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,9
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,9
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,9
Direct you to the best!,9
Exeunt severally,9
Enter CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN LUCIUS Lords and Attendants,9
Thanks royal sir.,9
And am right sorry that I must report ye,9
Our subjects sir,9
To show less sovereignty than they must needs,9
So sir: I desire of you,9
Madam all joy befal your grace!,9
My lords you are appointed for that office;,9
So farewell noble Lucius.,9
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth,9
Sir the event,9
Leave not the worthy Lucius good my lords,9
Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords,9
That we have given him cause.,9
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.,9
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely,9
The powers that he already hath in Gallia,9
His war for Britain.,9
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.,9
Hath made us forward. But my gentle queen,9
Before the Roman nor to us hath tender'd,9
A thing more made of malice than of duty:,9
We have been too slight in sufferance.,9
Royal sir,9
Hath her life been; the cure whereof my lord,9
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady,9
And strokes death to her.,9
Where is she sir? How,9
Please you sir,9
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.,9
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,9
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,9
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court,9
Her doors lock'd?,9
Prove false!,9
Son I say follow the king.,9
have not seen these two days.,9
Exit CLOTEN,9
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence,9
It is a thing most precious. But for her,9
Or wing'd with fervor of her love she's flown,9
To death or to dishonour; and my end,9
I have the placing of the British crown.,9
How now my son!,9
Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none,9
[Aside]            All the better: may,9
Exit,9
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite,9
The best she hath and she of all compounded,9
Disdaining me and throwing favours on,9
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point,9
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--,9
Who is here? What are you packing sirrah?,9
Where is thy lady? In a word; or else,9
O good my lord!,9
I will not ask again. Close villain,9
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?,9
A dram of worth be drawn.,9
How can she be with him? When was she missed?,9
Where is she sir? Come nearer;,9
What is become of her.,9
All-worthy villain!,9
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!',9
Thy condemnation and thy death.,9
This paper is the history of my knowledge,9
Presenting a letter,9
Even to Augustus' throne.,9
She's far enough; and what he learns by this,9
Hum!,9
Safe mayst thou wander safe return again!,9
Sir as I think.,9
wouldst not be a villain but do me true service,9
cause to use thee with a serious industry that is,9
directly and truly I would think thee an honest,9
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.,9
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and,9
that beggar Posthumus thou canst not in the,9
mine: wilt thou serve me?,9
Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy,9
I have my lord at my lodging the same suit he,9
The first service thou dost me fetch that suit,9
I shall my lord.,9
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one,9
villain Posthumus will I kill thee. I would these,9
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she,9
than my noble and natural person together with the,9
back will I ravish her: first kill him and in her,9
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground my,9
when my lust hath dined--which as I say to vex,9
praised--to the court I'll knock her back foot,9
and I'll be merry in my revenge.,9
Be those the garments?,9
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?,9
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second,9
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be,9
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had,9
Exit,9
Were to prove false which I will never be,9
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow flow,9
Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!,9
SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.,9
I see a man's life is a tedious one:,9
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,9
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,9
Foundations fly the wretched; such I mean,9
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,9
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,9
Is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood,9
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,9
At point to sink for food. But what is this?,9
I were best not to call; I dare not call:,9
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant,9
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?,9
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.,9
But fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on't.,9
Exit to the cave,9
You Polydote have proved best woodman and,9
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:,9
But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs,9
Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth,9
Poor house that keep'st thyself!,9
I am weak with toil yet strong in appetite.,9
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.,9
Stay; come not in.,9
Here were a fairy.,9
By Jupiter an angel! or if not,9
No elder than a boy!,9
Good masters harm me not:,9
To have begg'd or bought what I have took:,9
I have stol'n nought nor would not though I had found,9
I would have left it on the board so soon,9
With prayers for the provider.,9
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!,9
Who worship dirty gods.,9
Know if you kill me for my fault I should,9
Whither bound?,9
What's your name?,9
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;,9
I am fall'n in this offence.,9
Think us no churls nor measure our good minds,9
Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer,9
Boys bid him welcome.,9
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,9
I'll make't my comfort,9
And such a welcome as I'd give to him,9
Be sprightly for you fall 'mongst friends.,9
If brothers.,9
Would it had been so that they,9
Been less and so more equal ballasting,9
He wrings at some distress.,9
Or I whate'er it be,9
Hark boys.,9
Great men,9
That did attend themselves and had the virtue,9
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--,9
I'd change my sex to be companion with them,9
It shall be so.,9
Discourse is heavy fasting; when we have supp'd,9
So far as thou wilt speak it.,9
The night to the owl and morn to the lark,9
Thanks sir.,9
Exeunt,9
Enter two Senators and Tribunes,9
That since the common men are now in action,9
And that the legions now in Gallia are,9
The fall'n-off Britons that we do incite,9
Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,9
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!,9
Ay.,9
With those legions,9
Must be supplyant: the words of your commission,9
Of their dispatch.,9
Exeunt,9
SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius.,9
I am near to the place where they should meet if,9
serve me! Why should his mistress who was made by,9
rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said,9
play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it,9
in his own chamber--I mean the lines of my body are,9
not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the,9
conversant in general services and more remarkable,9
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!,9
shoulders shall within this hour be off; thy,9
thy face: and all this done spurn her home to her,9
rough usage; but my mother having power of his,9
horse is tied up safe: out sword and to a sore,9
the very description of their meeting-place; and,9
Exit,9
Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS and IMOGEN,9
We'll come to you after hunting.,9
Are we not brothers?,9
But clay and clay differs in dignity,9
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.,9
But not so citizen a wanton as,9
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom,9
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort,9
Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here:,9
Stealing so poorly.,9
How much the quantity the weight as much,9
What! how! how!,9
In my good brother's fault: I know not why,9
Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,9
My father not this youth.',9
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!,9
Nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace.,9
Doth miracle itself loved before me.,9
Brother farewell.,9
You health. So please you sir.,9
I have heard!,9
Experience O thou disprovest report!,9
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.,9
I'll now taste of thy drug.,9
I could not stir him:,9
Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest.,9
I might know more.,9
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.,9
Pray be not sick,9
Well or ill,9
And shalt be ever.,9
This youth how'er distress'd appears he hath had,9
How angel-like he sings!,9
In characters,9
And he her dieter.,9
A smiling with a sigh as if the sigh,9
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly,9
With winds that sailors rail at.,9
That grief and patience rooted in him both,9
Grow patience!,9
His perishing root with the increasing vine!,9
Who's there?,9
I cannot find those runagates; that villain,9
Those runagates!',9
Cloten the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.,9
I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!,9
What companies are near: pray you away;,9
Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?,9
A thing,9
A slave without a knock.,9
A law-breaker a villain: yield thee thief.,9
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?,9
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,9
Thou villain base,9
No nor thy tailor rascal,9
Which as it seems make thee.,9
My tailor made them not.,9
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;,9
Thou injurious thief,9
What's thy name?,9
Cloten thou double villain be thy name,9
Adder Spider,9
To thy further fear,9
I am son to the queen.,9
So worthy as thy birth.,9
Those that I reverence those I fear the wise:,9
Die the death:,9
I'll follow those that even now fled hence,9
Yield rustic mountaineer.,9
Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
None in the world: you did mistake him sure.,9
But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour,9
And burst of speaking were as his: I am absolute,9
In this place we left them:,9
You say he is so fell.,9
I mean to man he had not apprehension,9
Is oft the cause of fear. But see thy brother.,9
This Cloten was a fool an empty purse;,9
Could have knock'd out his brains for he had none:,9
My head as I do his.,9
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,9
Who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore,9
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,9
We are all undone.,9
But that he swore to take our lives? The law,9
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,9
For we do fear the law? What company,9
No single soul,9
He must have some attendants. Though his humour,9
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy not,9
To bring him here alone; although perhaps,9
Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time,9
As it is like him--might break out and swear,9
To come alone either he so undertaking,9
If we do fear this body hath a tail,9
Let ordinance,9
My brother hath done well.,9
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness,9
With his own sword,9
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek,9
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son Cloten:,9
Exit,9
Would Polydote thou hadst not done't! though valour,9
Would I had done't,9
I love thee brotherly but envy much,9
That possible strength might meet would seek us through,9
Well 'tis done:,9
Where there's no profit. I prithee to our rock;,9
Till hasty Polydote return and bring him,9
Poor sick Fidele!,9
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,9
Exit,9
Thou divine Nature how thyself thou blazon'st,9
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,9
Their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind,9
And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder,9
To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught,9
That wildly grows in them but yields a crop,9
What Cloten's being here to us portends,9
Re-enter GUIDERIUS,9
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,9
For his return.,9
My ingenious instrument!,9
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!,9
He went hence even now.,9
it did not speak before. All solemn things,9
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys,9
Is Cadwal mad?,9
And brings the dire occasion in his arms,9
Re-enter ARVIRAGUS with IMOGEN as dead bearing her in his arms,9
That we have made so much on. I had rather,9
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,9
O sweetest fairest lily!,9
As when thou grew'st thyself.,9
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find,9
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!,9
Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy.,9
Stark as you see:,9
Not as death's dart being laugh'd at; his,9
Reposing on a cushion.,9
O' the floor;,9
My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness,9
Why he but sleeps:,9
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,9
With fairest flowers,9
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack,9
The azured harebell like thy veins no nor,9
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,9
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie,9
Yea and furr'd moss besides when flowers are none,9
Prithee have done;,9
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,9
Is now due debt. To the grave!,9
By good Euriphile our mother.,9
And let us Polydore though now our voices,9
As once our mother; use like note and words,9
Cadwal,9
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse,9
We'll speak it then.,9
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son boys;,9
He was paid for that: though mean and,9
Together have one dust yet reverence,9
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely,9
Yet bury him as a prince.,9
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',9
If you'll go fetch him,9
Exit BELARIUS,9
My father hath a reason for't.,9
Come on then and remove him.,9
SONG,9
Nor the furious winter's rages;,9
Home art gone and ta'en thy wages:,9
As chimney-sweepers come to dust.,9
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;,9
To thee the reed is as the oak:,9
All follow this and come to dust.,9
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;,9
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:,9
Consign to thee and come to dust.,9
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!,9
Nothing ill come near thee!,9
And renowned be thy grave!,9
We have done our obsequies: come lay him down.,9
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night,9
You were as flowers now wither'd: even so,9
Come on away: apart upon our knees.,9
Their pleasures here are past so is their pain.,9
[Awaking]  Yes sir to Milford-Haven; which is,9
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray how far thither?,9
I have gone all night. 'Faith I'll lie down and sleep.,9
Seeing the body of CLOTEN,9
This bloody man the care on't. I hope I dream;,9
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;,9
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes,9
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be,9
As a wren's eye fear'd gods a part of it!,9
Without me as within me; not imagined felt.,9
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;,9
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face,9
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,9
Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten,9
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio,9
From this most bravest vessel of the world,9
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!,9
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,9
Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them,9
The drug he gave me which he said was precious,9
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:,9
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,9
Which chance to find us: O my lord my lord!,9
Enter LUCIUS a Captain and other Officers and a Soothsayer,9
After your will have cross'd the sea attending,9
They are in readiness.,9
The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners,9
That promise noble service: and they come,9
Syenna's brother.,9
With the next benefit o' the wind.,9
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers,9
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?,9
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:,9
From the spongy south to this part of the west,9
Unless my sins abuse my divination--,9
Dream often so,9
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime,9
Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead rather;,9
With the defunct or sleep upon the dead.,9
He's alive my lord.,9
Inform us of thy fortunes for it seems,9
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he,9
Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest,9
What art thou?,9
Nothing to be were better. This was my master,9
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!,9
From east to occident cry out for service,9
Find such another master.,9
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than,9
Richard du Champ.,9
If I do lie and do,9
They'll pardon it.--Say you sir?,9
Fidele sir.,9
Thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name.,9
Thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure,9
Sent by a consul to me should not sooner,9
I'll follow sir. But first an't please the gods,9
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when,9
And on it said a century of prayers,9
And leaving so his service follow you,9
Ay good youth!,9
My friends,9
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,9
A grave: come arm him. Boy he is preferr'd,9
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes,9
Exeunt,9
Enter CYMBELINE Lords PISANIO and Attendants,9
Exit an Attendant,9
A madness of which her life's in danger. Heavens,9
The great part of my comfort gone; my queen,9
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,9
The hope of comfort. But for thee fellow,9
Dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee,9
Sir my life is yours;,9
I nothing know where she remains why gone,9
Hold me your loyal servant.,9
The day that she was missing he was here:,9
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,9
And will no doubt be found.,9
To PISANIO,9
Does yet depend.,9
The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn,9
Of Roman gentlemen by the senate sent.,9
I am amazed with matter.,9
Your preparation can affront no less,9
you're ready:,9
That long to move.,9
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not,9
We grieve at chances here. Away!,9
I heard no letter from my master since,9
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise,9
What is betid to Cloten; but remain,9
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true to be true.,9
Even to the note o' the king or I'll fall in them.,9
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.,9
SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.,9
The noise is round about us.,9
What pleasure sir find we in life to lock it,9
Nay what hope,9
Must or for Britons slay us or receive us,9
During their use and slay us after.,9
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.,9
Of Cloten's death--we being not known not muster'd,9
Where we have lived and so extort from's that,9
Drawn on with torture.,9
In such a time nothing becoming you,9
It is not likely,9
Behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes,9
That they will waste their time upon our note,9
O I am known,9
Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him,9
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;,9
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless,9
But to be still hot summer's tamings and,9
Than be so,9
I and my brother are not known; yourself,9
Cannot be question'd.,9
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never,9
But that of coward hares hot goats and venison!,9
A rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel,9
To look upon the holy sun to have,9
So long a poor unknown.,9
If you will bless me sir and give me leave,9
The hazard therefore due fall on me by,9
So say I amen.,9
So slight a valuation should reserve,9
If in your country wars you chance to die,9
Lead lead.,9
The time seems long; their blood,9
Till it fly out and show them princes born.,9
ACT V,9
Enter POSTHUMUS with a bloody handkerchief,9
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,9
Must murder wives much better than themselves,9
Every good servant does not all commands:,9
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults I never,9
The noble Imogen to repent and struck,9
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,9
To second ills with ills each elder worse,9
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,9
Among the Italian gentry and to fight,9
That Britain I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!,9
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me,9
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight,9
For thee O Imogen even for whom my life,9
Pitied nor hated to the face of peril,9
More valour in me than my habits show.,9
To shame the guise o' the world I will begin,9
Exit,9
Enter from one side LUCIUS IACHIMO and  the Roman Army: from the other side the  British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again in skirmish IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO and then leaves him,9
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,9
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,9
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne,9
If that thy gentry Britain go before,9
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.,9
The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter to his rescue BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS,9
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but,9
Stand stand and fight!,9
Away boy from the troops and save thyself;,9
As war were hoodwink'd.,9
It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes,9
Exeunt,9
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord,9
I did.,9
I did.,9
But that the heavens fought: the king himself,9
And but the backs of Britons seen all flying,9
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work,9
Some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling,9
With dead men hurt behind and cowards living,9
Where was this lane?,9
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,9
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,9
He with two striplings-lads more like to run,9
With faces fit for masks or rather fairer,9
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,9
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;,9
Like beasts which you shun beastly and may save,9
These three,9
For three performers are the file when all,9
Accommodated by the place more charming,9
A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks,9
turn'd coward,9
Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look,9
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began,9
A rout confusion thick; forthwith they fly,9
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,9
The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open,9
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends,9
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:,9
The mortal bugs o' the field.,9
A narrow lane an old man and two boys.,9
Rather to wonder at the things you hear,9
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:,9
Preserved the Britons was the Romans' bane.',9
Lack to what end?,9
For if he'll do as he is made to do,9
You have put me into rhyme.,9
Still going?,9
This is a lord! O noble misery,9
To-day how many would have given their honours,9
And yet died too! I in mine own woe charm'd,9
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,9
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we,9
For being now a favourer to the Briton,9
The part I came in: fight I will no more,9
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is,9
Britons must take. For me my ransom's death;,9
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,9
Enter two British Captains and Soldiers,9
Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.,9
That gave the affront with them.,9
But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?,9
Who had not now been drooping here if seconds,9
Lay hands on him; a dog!,9
What crows have peck'd them here. He brags,9
As if he were of note: bring him to the king.,9
SCENE IV. A British prison.,9
You shall not now be stol'n you have locks upon you;,9
Ay or a stomach.,9
Most welcome bondage! for thou art away,9
Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather,9
By the sure physician death who is the key,9
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods give me,9
Then free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?,9
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?,9
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,9
No stricter render of me than my all.,9
Who of their broken debtors take a third,9
On their abatement: that's not my desire:,9
Tis not so dear yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:,9
Though light take pieces for the figure's sake:,9
If you will take this audit take this life,9
I'll speak to thee in silence.,9
Solemn music. Enter as in an apparition  SICILIUS LEONATUS father to Posthumus Leonatus  an old man attired like a warrior; leading in  his hand an ancient matron his wife and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus with music before them:  then after other music follow the two young  Leonati brothers to Posthumus Leonatus with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round as he lies sleeping,9
Thy spite on mortal flies:,9
That thy adulteries,9
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,9
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd,9
Whose father then as men report,9
Thou shouldst have been and shielded him,9
Lucina lent not me her aid,9
That from me was Posthumus ript,9
A thing of pity!,9
Moulded the stuff so fair,9
As great Sicilius' heir.,9
In Britain where was he,9
Or fruitful object be,9
Could deem his dignity?,9
To be exiled and thrown,9
From her his dearest one,9
Why did you suffer Iachimo,9
To taint his nobler heart and brain,9
And to become the geck and scorn,9
For this from stiller seats we came,9
That striking in our country's cause,9
Our fealty and Tenantius' right,9
Like hardiment Posthumus hath,9
Then Jupiter thou king of gods,9
The graces for his merits due,9
Thy crystal window ope; look out;,9
Upon a valiant race thy harsh,9
Since Jupiter our son is good,9
Peep through thy marble mansion; help;,9
To the shining synod of the rest,9
Help Jupiter; or we appeal,9
Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting  upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their knees,9
Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts,9
Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?,9
Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:,9
No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.,9
The more delay'd delighted. Be content;,9
His comforts thrive his trials well are spent.,9
Our temple was he married. Rise and fade.,9
And happier much by his affliction made.,9
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:,9
Express impatience lest you stir up mine.,9
Ascends,9
Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle,9
More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird,9
As when his god is pleased.,9
The marble pavement closes he is enter'd,9
Let us with care perform his great behest.,9
[Waking]  Sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot,9
A mother and two brothers: but O scorn!,9
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend,9
Wake and find nothing. But alas I swerve:,9
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,9
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!,9
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects,9
As good as promise.,9
When as a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown,9
tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be,9
shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and,9
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.',9
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;,9
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,9
I'll keep if but for sympathy.,9
Come sir are you ready for death?,9
Hanging is the word sir: if,9
So if I prove a good repast to the,9
A heavy reckoning for you sir. But the comfort is,9
more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of,9
flint for want of meat depart reeling with too,9
sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain,9
light the purse too light being drawn of,9
quit. O the charity of a penny cord! It sums up,9
creditor but it; of what's past is and to come,9
counters; so the acquittance follows.,9
Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the,9
sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I think he,9
sir you know not which way you shall go.,9
Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen,9
some that take upon them to know or do take upon,9
jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how,9
never return to tell one.,9
direct them the way I am going but such as wink and,9
What an infinite mock is this that a man should,9
blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.,9
Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.,9
I'll be hang'd then.,9
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger,9
gibbets I never saw one so prone. Yet on my,9
for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them,9
were one. I would we were all of one mind and one,9
gallowses! I speak against my present profit but,9
Exeunt,9
Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS PISANIO Lords Officers and Attendants,9
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart,9
Whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast,9
He shall be happy that can find him if,9
I never saw,9
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought,9
No tidings of him?,9
But no trace of him.,9
The heir of his reward;,9
which I will add,9
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time,9
Sir,9
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,9
Bow your knees.,9
Companions to our person and will fit you,9
Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies,9
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,9
Hail great king!,9
The queen is dead.,9
Would this report become? But I consider,9
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?,9
Which being cruel to the world concluded,9
I will report so please you: these her women,9
Were present when she finish'd.,9
First she confess'd she never loved you only,9
Married your royalty was wife to your place;,9
She alone knew this;,9
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.,9
With such integrity she did confess,9
But that her flight prevented it she had,9
O most delicate fiend!,9
More sir and worse. She did confess she had,9
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering,9
By watching weeping tendance kissing to,9
When she had fitted you with her craft to work,9
But failing of her end by his strange absence,9
Of heaven and men her purposes; repented,9
Despairing died.,9
We did so please your highness.,9
Were not in fault for she was beautiful;,9
That thought her like her seeming; it had,9
To have mistrusted her: yet O my daughter!,9
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!,9
Thou comest not Caius now for tribute that,9
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit,9
Of you their captives which ourself have granted:,9
Consider sir the chance of war: the day,9
We should not when the blood was cool,9
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods,9
May be call'd ransom let it come: sufficeth,9
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much,9
I will entreat; my boy a Briton born,9
A page so kind so duteous diligent,9
So feat so nurse-like: let his virtue join,9
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,9
And spare no blood beside.,9
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,9
And art mine own. I know not why wherefore,9
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,9
Yea though thou do demand a prisoner,9
I humbly thank your highness.,9
And yet I know thou wilt.,9
There's other work in hand: I see a thing,9
Must shuffle for itself.,9
He leaves me scorns me: briefly die their joys,9
Why stands he so perplex'd?,9
I love thee more and more: think more and more,9
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?,9
Than I to your highness; who being born your vassal,9
Wherefore eyest him so?,9
To give me hearing.,9
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?,9
Thou'rt my good youth my page;,9
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart,9
One sand another,9
Who died and was Fidele. What think you?,9
Peace peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;,9
He would have spoke to us.,9
Be silent; let's see further.,9
Since she is living let the time run on,9
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward,9
Make thy demand aloud.,9
Sir step you forth;,9
Or by our greatness and the grace of it,9
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On speak to him.,9
Of whom he had this ring.,9
That diamond upon your finger say,9
Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that,9
How! me?,9
Which torments me to conceal. By villany,9
Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may,9
As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived,9
All that belongs to this.,9
For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits,9
My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:,9
Than die ere I hear more: strive man and speak.,9
That struck the hour!--it was in Rome--accursed,9
Our viands had been poison'd or at least,9
What should I say? he was too good to be,9
Amongst the rarest of good ones--sitting sadly,9
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast,9
The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva.,9
A shop of all the qualities that man,9
Fairness which strikes the eye--,9
Come to the matter.,9
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,9
That had a royal lover took his hint;,9
He was as calm as virtue--he began,9
being made,9
Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls or his description,9
Nay nay to the purpose.,9
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams,9
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him,9
Upon his honour'd finger to attain,9
By hers and mine adultery. He true knight,9
Than I did truly find her stakes this ring;,9
Of Phoebus' wheel and might so safely had it,9
Post I in this design: well may you sir,9
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference,9
Of hope not longing mine Italian brain,9
Most vilely; for my vantage excellent:,9
That I return'd with simular proof enough,9
By wounding his belief in her renown,9
Of chamber-hanging pictures this her bracelet--,9
Of secret on her person that he could not,9
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--,9
[Advancing]             Ay so thou dost,9
Egregious murderer thief any thing,9
To come! O give me cord or knife or poison,9
For torturers ingenious: it is I,9
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,9
That caused a lesser villain than myself,9
Of virtue was she; yea and she herself.,9
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain,9
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!,9
Imogen Imogen!,9
Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,9
Striking her: she falls,9
Mine and your mistress! O my lord Posthumus!,9
Mine honour'd lady!,9
How come these staggers on me?,9
If this be so the gods do mean to strike me,9
How fares thy mistress?,9
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow hence!,9
The tune of Imogen!,9
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me if,9
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.,9
It poison'd me.,9
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.,9
Have' said she 'given his mistress that confection,9
As I would serve a rat.',9
The queen sir very oft importuned me,9
The satisfaction of her knowledge only,9
Of no esteem: I dreading that her purpose,9
A certain stuff which being ta'en would cease,9
All offices of nature should again,9
Most like I did for I was dead.,9
There was our error.,9
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?,9
Throw me again.,9
Hang there like a fruit my soul,9
How now my flesh my child!,9
Wilt thou not speak to me?,9
[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love,9
You had a motive for't.,9
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,9
I am sorry for't my lord.,9
That we meet here so strangely: but her son,9
My lord,9
Upon my lady's missing came to me,9
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,9
had a feigned letter of my master's,9
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;,9
Which he enforced from me away he posts,9
My lady's honour: what became of him,9
Let me end the story:,9
Marry the gods forfend!,9
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee valiant youth,9
I have spoke it and I did it.,9
A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me,9
With language that would make me spurn the sea,9
And am right glad he is not standing here,9
I am sorry for thee:,9
Endure our law: thou'rt dead.,9
I thought had been my lord.,9
And take him from our presence.,9
This man is better than the man he slew,9
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens,9
To the Guard,9
They were not born for bondage.,9
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,9
As good as we?,9
And thou shalt die for't.,9
But I will prove that two on's are as good,9
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,9
Your danger's ours.,9
Have at it then by leave.,9
Was call'd Belarius.,9
A banish'd traitor.,9
Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;,9
Take him hence:,9
Not too hot:,9
And let it be confiscate all so soon,9
Nursing of my sons!,9
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;,9
These two young gentlemen that call me father,9
They are the issue of your loins my liege,9
How! my issue!,9
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:,9
Itself and all my treason; that I suffer'd,9
For such and so they are--these twenty years,9
Could put into them; my breeding was sir as,9
Whom for the theft I wedded stole these children,9
Having received the punishment before,9
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,9
Unto my end of stealing them. But gracious sir,9
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.,9
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy,9
Thou weep'st and speak'st.,9
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:,9
A pair of worthier sons.,9
This gentleman whom I call Polydore,9
This gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus,9
In a most curious mantle wrought by the hand,9
I can with ease produce.,9
Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star;,9
This is he;,9
It was wise nature's end in the donation,9
O what am I,9
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,9
may reign in them now! O Imogen,9
No my lord;,9
Have we thus met? O never say hereafter,9
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,9
Did you e'er meet?,9
And at first meeting loved;,9
By the queen's dram she swallow'd.,9
When shall I hear all through? This fierce,9
Hath to it circumstantial branches which,9
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?,9
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,9
I know not how much more should be demanded;,9
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place,9
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,9
On him her brother me her master hitting,9
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,9
To BELARIUS,9
You are my father too and did relieve me,9
All o'erjoy'd,9
For they shall taste our comfort.,9
I will yet do you service.,9
The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought,9
The thankings of a king.,9
The soldier that did company these three,9
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,9
Have made you finish.,9
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,9
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;,9
That ever swore her faith.,9
The power that I have on you is to spare you;,9
And deal with others better.,9
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;,9
You holp us sir,9
Joy'd are we that you are.,9
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept methought,9
Appear'd to me with other spritely shows,9
This label on my bosom; whose containing,9
Make no collection of it: let him show,9
Philarmonus!,9
Read and declare the meaning.,9
unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a,9
shall be lopped branches which being dead many,9
stock and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end,9
peace and plenty.',9
The fit and apt construction of thy name,9
To CYMBELINE,9
Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer',9
Is this most constant wife; who even now,9
Unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about,9
This hath some seeming.,9
Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point,9
For many years thought dead are now revived,9
Promises Britain peace and plenty.,9
My peace we will begin. And Caius Lucius,9
And to the Roman empire; promising,9
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;,9
Have laid most heavy hand.,9
The harmony of this peace. The vision,9
Of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant,9
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,9
So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,9
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,9
Laud we the gods;,9
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace,9
A Roman and a British ensign wave,9
And in the temple of great Jupiter,9
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,9
Exeunt,9
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.,10
Who's there?,10
Long live the king!,10
He.,10
Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed Francisco.,10
And I am sick at heart.,10
Not a mouse stirring.,10
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,10
I think I hear them. Stand ho! Who's there?,10
Friends to this ground.,10
Give you good night.,10
Who hath relieved you?,10
Give you good night.,10
Holla! Bernardo!,10
What is Horatio there?,10
Welcome Horatio: welcome good Marcellus.,10
I have seen nothing.,10
And will not let belief take hold of him,10
Therefore I have entreated him along,10
That if again this apparition come,10
Tush tush 'twill not appear.,10
And let us once again assail your ears,10
What we have two nights seen.,10
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.,10
When yond same star that's westward from the pole,10
Where now it burns Marcellus and myself,10
Enter Ghost,10
In the same figure like the king that's dead.,10
Looks it not like the king?  mark it Horatio.,10
It would be spoke to.,10
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,10
In which the majesty of buried Denmark,10
It is offended.,10
Stay! speak speak! I charge thee speak!,10
Tis gone and will not answer.,10
Is not this something more than fantasy?,10
Before my God I might not this believe,10
Of mine own eyes.,10
As thou art to thyself:,10
When he the ambitious Norway combated;,10
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.,10
Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour,10
In what particular thought to work I know not;,10
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.,10
Why this same strict and most observant watch,10
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,10
Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task,10
What might be toward that this sweaty haste,10
Who is't that can inform me?,10
At least the whisper goes so. Our last king,10
Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway,10
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--,10
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,10
Did forfeit with his life all those his lands,10
Against the which a moiety competent,10
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,10
And carriage of the article design'd,10
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,10
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,10
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--,10
But to recover of us by strong hand,10
So by his father lost: and this I take it,10
The source of this our watch and the chief head,10
I think it be no other but e'en so:,10
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king,10
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.,10
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,10
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:,10
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,10
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:,10
As harbingers preceding still the fates,10
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated,10
But soft behold! lo where it comes again!,10
I'll cross it though it blast me. Stay illusion!,10
Speak to me:,10
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,10
Cock crows,10
Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak!,10
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,10
Speak of it: stay and speak! Stop it Marcellus.,10
Do if it will not stand.,10
Tis here!,10
Exit Ghost,10
To offer it the show of violence;,10
And our vain blows malicious mockery.,10
And then it started like a guilty thing,10
The cock that is the trumpet to the morn,10
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,10
The extravagant and erring spirit hies,10
This present object made probation.,10
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes,10
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:,10
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,10
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.,10
But look the morn in russet mantle clad,10
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,10
Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,10
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,10
Let's do't I pray; and I this morning know,10
Exeunt,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE HAMLET  POLONIUS LAERTES VOLTIMAND CORNELIUS Lords and Attendants,10
The memory be green and that it us befitted,10
To be contracted in one brow of woe,10
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,10
Therefore our sometime sister now our queen,10
Have we as 'twere with a defeated joy--,10
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,10
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd,10
With this affair along. For all our thanks.,10
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,10
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,10
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,10
Lost by his father with all bonds of law,10
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:,10
To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras--,10
Of this his nephew's purpose--to suppress,10
The lists and full proportions are all made,10
You good Cornelius and you Voltimand,10
Giving to you no further personal power,10
Of these delated articles allow.,10
In that and all things will we show our duty.,10
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS,10
You told us of some suit; what is't Laertes?,10
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg Laertes,10
The head is not more native to the heart,10
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.,10
My dread lord,10
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,10
Yet now I must confess that duty done,10
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.,10
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave,10
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:,10
Take thy fair hour Laertes; time be thine,10
But now my cousin Hamlet and my son--,10
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?,10
Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off,10
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids,10
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,10
Ay madam it is common.,10
Why seems it so particular with thee?,10
Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother,10
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,10
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,10
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,10
But I have that within which passeth show;,10
Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet,10
But you must know your father lost a father;,10
In filial obligation for some term,10
In obstinate condolement is a course,10
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,10
An understanding simple and unschool'd:,10
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,10
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,10
To reason most absurd: whose common theme,10
From the first corse till he that died to-day,10
This unprevailing woe and think of us,10
You are the most immediate to our throne;,10
Than that which dearest father bears his son,10
In going back to school in Wittenberg,10
And we beseech you bend you to remain,10
Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son.,10
I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.,10
Why 'tis a loving and a fair reply:,10
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet,10
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,10
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,10
Exeunt all but HAMLET,10
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!,10
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!,10
Seem to me all the uses of this world!,10
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature,10
But two months dead: nay not so much not two:,10
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,10
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!,10
As if increase of appetite had grown,10
Let me not think on't--Frailty thy name is woman!--,10
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,10
O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,10
My father's brother but no more like my father,10
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears,10
She married. O most wicked speed to post,10
It is not nor it cannot come to good:,10
Enter HORATIO MARCELLUS and BERNARDO,10
I am glad to see you well:,10
The same my lord and your poor servant ever.,10
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio? Marcellus?,10
I am very glad to see you. Good even sir.,10
A truant disposition good my lord.,10
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,10
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.,10
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.,10
I pray thee do not mock me fellow-student;,10
Indeed my lord it follow'd hard upon.,10
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.,10
Or ever I had seen that day Horatio!,10
Where my lord?,10
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.,10
I shall not look upon his like again.,10
Saw? who?,10
The king my father!,10
With an attent ear till I may deliver,10
This marvel to you.,10
Two nights together had these gentlemen,10
In the dead vast and middle of the night,10
Armed at point exactly cap-a-pe,10
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd,10
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distilled,10
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me,10
And I with them the third night kept the watch;,10
Form of the thing each word made true and good,10
These hands are not more like.,10
My lord upon the platform where we watch'd.,10
My lord I did;,10
It lifted up its head and did address,10
But even then the morning cock crew loud,10
And vanish'd from our sight.,10
As I do live my honour'd lord 'tis true;,10
To let you know of it.,10
Hold you the watch to-night?,10
Arm'd say you?,10
From top to toe?,10
Then saw you not his face?,10
What look'd he frowningly?,10
Pale or red?,10
And fix'd his eyes upon you?,10
I would I had been there.,10
Very like very like. Stay'd it long?,10
Longer longer.,10
His beard was grizzled--no?,10
A sable silver'd.,10
Perchance 'twill walk again.,10
If it assume my noble father's person,10
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,10
Let it be tenable in your silence still;,10
Give it an understanding but no tongue:,10
Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve,10
Our duty to your honour.,10
Exeunt all but HAMLET,10
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!,10
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes.,10
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.,10
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:,10
And convoy is assistant do not sleep,10
Do you doubt that?,10
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,10
Forward not permanent sweet not lasting,10
No more but so?,10
For nature crescent does not grow alone,10
The inward service of the mind and soul,10
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch,10
His greatness weigh'd his will is not his own;,10
He may not as unvalued persons do,10
The safety and health of this whole state;,10
Unto the voice and yielding of that body,10
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it,10
May give his saying deed; which is no further,10
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,10
Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open,10
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister,10
Out of the shot and danger of desire.,10
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:,10
The canker galls the infants of the spring,10
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth,10
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:,10
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,10
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,10
Whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine,10
And recks not his own rede.,10
I stay too long: but here my father comes.,10
A double blessing is a double grace,10
Yet here Laertes! aboard aboard for shame!,10
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!,10
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,10
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.,10
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;,10
Of each new-hatch'd unfledged comrade. Beware,10
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.,10
Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment.,10
But not express'd in fancy; rich not gaudy;,10
And they in France of the best rank and station,10
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;,10
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.,10
And it must follow as the night the day,10
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!,10
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.,10
What I have said to you.,10
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.,10
Exit,10
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet.,10
Tis told me he hath very oft of late,10
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:,10
And that in way of caution I must tell you,10
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.,10
He hath my lord of late made many tenders,10
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,10
Do you believe his tenders as you call them?,10
Marry I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;,10
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;,10
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.,10
In honourable fashion.,10
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord,10
Ay springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,10
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes daughter,10
Even in their promise as it is a-making,10
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;,10
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,10
And with a larger tether may he walk,10
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,10
But mere implorators of unholy suits,10
The better to beguile. This is for all:,10
Have you so slander any moment leisure,10
Look to't I charge you: come your ways.,10
Exeunt,10
Enter HAMLET HORATIO and MARCELLUS,10
It is a nipping and an eager air.,10
I think it lacks of twelve.,10
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season,10
A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within,10
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,10
And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,10
The triumph of his pledge.,10
Ay marry is't:,10
And to the manner born it is a custom,10
This heavy-headed revel east and west,10
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase,10
From our achievements though perform'd at height,10
So oft it chances in particular men,10
As in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,10
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,10
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens,10
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect,10
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,10
Shall in the general censure take corruption,10
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt,10
Look my lord it comes!,10
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!,10
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,10
Thou comest in such a questionable shape,10
King father royal Dane: O answer me!,10
Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death,10
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,10
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,10
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,10
So horridly to shake our disposition,10
Say why is this? wherefore? what should we do?,10
It beckons you to go away with it,10
To you alone.,10
It waves you to a more removed ground:,10
No by no means.,10
Do not my lord.,10
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;,10
Being a thing immortal as itself?,10
What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord,10
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,10
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,10
The very place puts toys of desperation,10
That looks so many fathoms to the sea,10
It waves me still.,10
You shall not go my lord.,10
Be ruled; you shall not go.,10
And makes each petty artery in this body,10
Still am I call'd. Unhand me gentlemen.,10
I say away! Go on; I'll follow thee.,10
He waxes desperate with imagination.,10
Have after. To what issue will this come?,10
Heaven will direct it.,10
Exeunt,10
Enter GHOST and HAMLET,10
Mark me.,10
My hour is almost come,10
Must render up myself.,10
Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing,10
Speak; I am bound to hear.,10
What?,10
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,10
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature,10
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,10
Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood,10
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,10
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:,10
To ears of flesh and blood. List list O list!,10
O God!,10
Murder!,10
But this most foul strange and unnatural.,10
As meditation or the thoughts of love,10
I find thee apt;,10
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,10
Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard,10
Is by a forged process of my death,10
The serpent that did sting thy father's life,10
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!,10
With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts--,10
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust,10
O Hamlet what a falling-off was there!,10
That it went hand in hand even with the vow,10
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor,10
But virtue as it never will be moved,10
So lust though to a radiant angel link'd,10
And prey on garbage.,10
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,10
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,10
And in the porches of my ears did pour,10
Holds such an enmity with blood of man,10
The natural gates and alleys of the body,10
And curd like eager droppings into milk,10
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,10
All my smooth body.,10
Of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd:,10
Unhousel'd disappointed unanel'd,10
With all my imperfections on my head:,10
If thou hast nature in thee bear it not;,10
A couch for luxury and damned incest.,10
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive,10
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,10
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,10
Adieu adieu! Hamlet remember me.,10
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?,10
And you my sinews grow not instant old,10
Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat,10
Yea from the table of my memory,10
All saws of books all forms all pressures past,10
And thy commandment all alone shall live,10
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes by heaven!,10
O villain villain smiling damned villain!,10
That one may smile and smile and be a villain;,10
Writing,10
It is 'Adieu adieu! remember me.',10
[Within]  My lord my lord--,10
[Within] Heaven secure him!,10
[Within]  Hillo ho ho my lord!,10
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS,10
What news my lord?,10
Good my lord tell it.,10
Not I my lord by heaven.,10
How say you then; would heart of man once think it?,10
Ay by heaven my lord.,10
But he's an arrant knave.,10
To tell us this.,10
And so without more circumstance at all,10
You as your business and desire shall point you;,10
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,10
These are but wild and whirling words my lord.,10
Yes 'faith heartily.,10
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio,10
It is an honest ghost that let me tell you:,10
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now good friends,10
Give me one poor request.,10
Never make known what you have seen to-night.,10
Nay but swear't.,10
My lord not I.,10
Upon my sword.,10
Indeed upon my sword indeed.,10
Ah ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,10
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--,10
Propose the oath my lord.,10
Swear by my sword.,10
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.,10
And lay your hands again upon my sword:,10
Swear by my sword.,10
Well said old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?,10
O day and night but this is wondrous strange!,10
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio,10
Here as before never so help you mercy,10
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet,10
That you at such times seeing me never shall,10
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,10
Or 'If we list to speak' or 'There be an if they might',10
That you know aught of me: this not to do,10
[Beneath]  Swear.,10
They swear,10
With all my love I do commend me to you:,10
May do to express his love and friending to you,10
And still your fingers on your lips I pray.,10
That ever I was born to set it right!,10
Exeunt,10
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.,10
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo.,10
You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo,10
Of his behavior.,10
Marry well said; very well said. Look you sir,10
And how and who what means and where they keep,10
By this encompassment and drift of question,10
Than your particular demands will touch it:,10
As thus 'I know his father and his friends,10
Ay very well my lord.,10
But if't be he I mean he's very wild;,10
What forgeries you please; marry none so rank,10
But sir such wanton wild and usual slips,10
To youth and liberty.,10
Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling,10
My lord that would dishonour him.,10
You must not put another scandal on him,10
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly,10
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,10
Of general assault.,10
Wherefore should you do this?,10
I would know that.,10
And I believe it is a fetch of wit:,10
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working Mark you,10
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes,10
He closes with you in this consequence;,10
According to the phrase or the addition,10
Very good my lord.,10
about to say? By the mass I was about to say,10
At 'closes in the consequence' at 'friend or so',10
At 'closes in the consequence' ay marry;,10
I saw him yesterday or t' other day,10
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;,10
I saw him enter such a house of sale',10
See you now;,10
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,10
By indirections find directions out:,10
Shall you my son. You have me have you not?,10
God be wi' you; fare you well.,10
Observe his inclination in yourself.,10
And let him ply his music.,10
Farewell!,10
Enter OPHELIA,10
O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted!,10
My lord as I was sewing in my closet,10
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,10
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;,10
As if he had been loosed out of hell,10
Mad for thy love?,10
But truly I do fear it.,10
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;,10
And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,10
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;,10
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,10
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,10
And with his head over his shoulder turn'd,10
For out o' doors he went without their helps,10
Come go with me: I will go seek the king.,10
Whose violent property fordoes itself,10
As oft as any passion under heaven,10
What have you given him any hard words of late?,10
I did repel his fetters and denied,10
That hath made him mad.,10
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,10
By heaven it is as proper to our age,10
As it is common for the younger sort,10
This must be known; which being kept close might,10
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.,10
SCENE II. A room in the castle.,10
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!,10
The need we have to use you did provoke,10
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,10
Resembles that it was. What it should be,10
So much from the understanding of himself,10
That being of so young days brought up with him,10
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court,10
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,10
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus,10
Good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you;,10
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you,10
As to expend your time with us awhile,10
Your visitation shall receive such thanks,10
Both your majesties,10
Put your dread pleasures more into command,10
But we both obey,10
To lay our service freely at your feet,10
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.,10
And I beseech you instantly to visit,10
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.,10
Pleasant and helpful to him!,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and some Attendants,10
The ambassadors from Norway my good lord,10
Thou still hast been the father of good news.,10
I hold my duty as I hold my soul,10
And I do think or else this brain of mine,10
As it hath used to do that I have found,10
O speak of that; that do I long to hear.,10
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.,10
Exit POLONIUS,10
The head and source of all your son's distemper.,10
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.,10
Re-enter POLONIUS with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS,10
Say Voltimand what from our brother Norway?,10
Upon our first he sent out to suppress,10
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;,10
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,10
Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests,10
Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine,10
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.,10
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,10
So levied as before against the Polack:,10
Giving a paper,10
Through your dominions for this enterprise,10
As therein are set down.,10
And at our more consider'd time well read,10
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:,10
Most welcome home!,10
This business is well ended.,10
What majesty should be what duty is,10
Were nothing but to waste night day and time.,10
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,10
Mad call I it; for to define true madness,10
But let that go.,10
Madam I swear I use no art at all.,10
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;,10
Mad let us grant him then: and now remains,10
Or rather say the cause of this defect,10
Thus it remains and the remainder thus. Perpend.,10
Who in her duty and obedience mark,10
Reads,10
beautified Ophelia'--,10
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:,10
In her excellent white bosom these  and c.',10
Good madam stay awhile; I will be faithful.,10
Doubt thou the stars are fire;,10
Doubt truth to be a liar;,10
O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers;,10
I love thee best O most best believe it. Adieu.,10
this machine is to him HAMLET.',10
And more above hath his solicitings,10
All given to mine ear.,10
Received his love?,10
As of a man faithful and honourable.,10
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--,10
Before my daughter told me--what might you,10
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,10
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;,10
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:,10
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,10
Admit no messengers receive no tokens.,10
And he repulsed--a short tale to make--,10
Thence to a watch thence into a weakness,10
Into the madness wherein now he raves,10
Do you think 'tis this?,10
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--,10
When it proved otherwise?,10
[Pointing to his head and shoulder],10
If circumstances lead me I will find,10
Within the centre.,10
You know sometimes he walks four hours together,10
So he does indeed.,10
Be you and I behind an arras then;,10
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,10
But keep a farm and carters.,10
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.,10
I'll board him presently.,10
Enter HAMLET reading,10
How does my good Lord Hamlet?,10
Do you know me my lord?,10
Not I my lord.,10
Honest my lord!,10
one man picked out of ten thousand.,10
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a,10
I have my lord.,10
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.,10
[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my,10
was a fishmonger: he is far gone far gone: and,10
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.,10
Words words words.,10
Between who?,10
Slanders sir: for the satirical rogue says here,10
wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and,10
wit together with most weak hams: all which sir,10
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for,10
you could go backward.,10
in 't. Will you walk out of the air my lord?,10
Indeed that is out o' the air.,10
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness,10
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will,10
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable,10
You cannot sir take from me any thing that I will,10
my life except my life.,10
These tedious old fools!,10
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.,10
Exit POLONIUS,10
My most dear lord!,10
Guildenstern? Ah Rosencrantz! Good lads how do ye both?,10
Happy in that we are not over-happy;,10
Nor the soles of her shoe?,10
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of,10
Faith her privates we.,10
is a strumpet. What's the news?,10
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.,10
my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune,10
Prison my lord!,10
Then is the world one.,10
wards and dungeons Denmark being one o' the worst.,10
Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing,10
it is a prison.,10
narrow for your mind.,10
myself a king of infinite space were it not that I,10
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very,10
A dream itself is but a shadow.,10
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.,10
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we,10
We'll wait upon you.,10
of my servants for to speak to you like an honest,10
beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore?,10
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks; but I,10
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it,10
deal justly with me: come come; nay speak.,10
Why any thing but to the purpose. You were sent,10
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:,10
To what end my lord?,10
the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of,10
love and by what more dear a better proposer could,10
whether you were sent for or no?,10
[Aside]  Nay then I have an eye of you.--If you,10
My lord we were sent for.,10
prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king,10
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth forgone all,10
with my disposition that this goodly frame the,10
excellent canopy the air look you this brave,10
with golden fire why it appears no other thing to,10
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!,10
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!,10
world! the paragon of animals! And yet to me,10
me: no nor woman neither though by your smiling,10
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts.,10
To think my lord if you delight not in man what,10
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they,10
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty,10
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not,10
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose,10
say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt,10
Even those you were wont to take delight in the,10
How chances it they travel? their residence both,10
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the,10
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was,10
No indeed are they not.,10
Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but,10
that cry out on the top of question and are most,10
fashion and so berattle the common stages--so they,10
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.,10
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no,10
afterwards if they should grow themselves to common,10
better--their writers do them wrong to make them,10
Faith there has been much to do on both sides; and,10
controversy: there was for a while no money bid,10
cuffs in the question.,10
O there has been much throwing about of brains.,10
Ay that they do my lord; Hercules and his load too.,10
Denmark and those that would make mows at him while,10
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.,10
natural if philosophy could find it out.,10
There are the players.,10
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion,10
lest my extent to the players which I tell you,10
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my,10
In what my dear lord?,10
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.,10
Well be with you gentlemen!,10
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet,10
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they,10
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;,10
twas so indeed.,10
My lord I have news to tell you.,10
The actors are come hither my lord.,10
Upon mine honour--,10
The best actors in the world either for tragedy,10
historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-,10
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor,10
liberty these are the only men.,10
What a treasure had he my lord?,10
One fair daughter and no more,10
[Aside]  Still on my daughter.,10
If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter,10
Nay that follows not.,10
Why,10
and then you know,10
the first row of the pious chanson will show you,10
Enter four or five Players,10
to see thee well. Welcome good friends. O my old,10
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What my young,10
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the,10
apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the,10
to't like French falconers fly at any thing we see:,10
of your quality; come a passionate speech.,10
I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was,10
play I remember pleased not the million; 'twas,10
it and others whose judgments in such matters,10
digested in the scenes set down with as much,10
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter,10
indict the author of affectation; but called it an,10
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I,10
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of,10
at this line: let me see let me see--,10
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--,10
Black as his purpose did the night resemble,10
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd,10
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd,10
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,10
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,10
With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus,10
So proceed you.,10
good discretion.,10
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,10
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,10
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword,10
Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top,10
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,10
Of reverend Priam seem'd i' the air to stick:,10
And like a neutral to his will and matter,10
But as we often see against some storm,10
The bold winds speechless and the orb below,10
Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus' pause,10
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall,10
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword,10
Out out thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,10
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,10
As low as to the fiends!',10
It shall to the barber's with your beard. Prithee,10
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.,10
The mobled queen?',10
Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames,10
Where late the diadem stood and for a robe,10
A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up;,10
Gainst Fortune's state would treason have,10
But if the gods themselves did see her then,10
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,10
Unless things mortal move them not at all,10
And passion in the gods.',10
tears in's eyes. Pray you no more.,10
Good my lord will you see the players well,10
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the,10
epitaph than their ill report while you live.,10
God's bodykins man much better: use every man,10
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less,10
Take them in.,10
Follow him friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.,10
Dost thou hear me old friend; can you play the,10
Ay my lord.,10
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which,10
Ay my lord.,10
not.,10
My good friends I'll leave you till night: you are,10
Good my lord!,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!,10
But in a fiction in a dream of passion,10
That from her working all his visage wann'd,10
A broken voice and his whole function suiting,10
For Hecuba!,10
That he should weep for her? What would he do,10
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears,10
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,10
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,10
Like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause,10
Upon whose property and most dear life,10
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?,10
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,10
Ha!,10
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall,10
I should have fatted all the region kites,10
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain!,10
Why what an ass am I! This is most brave,10
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,10
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,10
Fie upon't! foh! About my brain! I have heard,10
Have by the very cunning of the scene,10
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;,10
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players,10
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;,10
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen,10
To assume a pleasing shape; yea and perhaps,10
As he is very potent with such spirits,10
More relative than this: the play 's the thing,10
Exit,10
SCENE I. A room in the castle.,10
And can you by no drift of circumstance,10
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet,10
He does confess he feels himself distracted;,10
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,10
When we would bring him on to some confession,10
Did he receive you well?,10
But with much forcing of his disposition.,10
Most free in his reply.,10
To any pastime?,10
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;,10
To hear of it: they are about the court,10
This night to play before him.,10
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties,10
With all my heart; and it doth much content me,10
Good gentlemen give him a further edge,10
We shall my lord.,10
Sweet Gertrude leave us too;,10
That he as 'twere by accident may here,10
Her father and myself lawful espials,10
We may of their encounter frankly judge,10
If 't be the affliction of his love or no,10
I shall obey you.,10
That your good beauties be the happy cause,10
Will bring him to his wonted way again,10
Madam I wish it may.,10
Ophelia walk you here. Gracious so please you,10
To OPHELIA,10
That show of such an exercise may colour,10
Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage,10
The devil himself.,10
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!,10
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it,10
O heavy burthen!,10
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS,10
To be or not to be: that is the question:,10
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,10
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;,10
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks,10
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die to sleep;,10
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,10
Must give us pause: there's the respect,10
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,10
The pangs of despised love the law's delay,10
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,10
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,10
But that the dread of something after death,10
No traveller returns puzzles the will,10
Than fly to others that we know not of?,10
And thus the native hue of resolution,10
And enterprises of great pith and moment,10
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!,10
Be all my sins remember'd.,10
How does your honour for this many a day?,10
My lord I have remembrances of yours,10
I pray you now receive them.,10
I never gave you aught.,10
And with them words of so sweet breath composed,10
Take these again; for to the noble mind,10
There my lord.,10
My lord?,10
What means your lordship?,10
admit no discourse to your beauty.,10
with honesty?,10
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the,10
likeness: this was sometime a paradox but now the,10
Indeed my lord you made me believe so.,10
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of,10
I was the more deceived.,10
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;,10
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very,10
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,10
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling,10
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.,10
At home my lord.,10
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.,10
If thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague for,10
snow thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a,10
marry marry a fool; for wise men know well enough,10
and quickly too. Farewell.,10
I have heard of your paintings too well enough; God,10
another: you jig you amble and you lisp and,10
your ignorance. Go to I'll no more on't; it hath,10
those that are married already all but one shall,10
nunnery go.,10
O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!,10
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,10
The observed of all observers quite quite down!,10
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,10
Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh;,10
Blasted with ecstasy: O woe is me,10
Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS,10
Nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little,10
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;,10
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,10
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,10
Haply the seas and countries different,10
This something-settled matter in his heart,10
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?,10
The origin and commencement of his grief,10
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;,10
But if you hold it fit after the play,10
To show his grief: let her be round with him;,10
Of all their conference. If she find him not,10
Your wisdom best shall think.,10
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.,10
SCENE II. A hall in the castle.,10
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to,10
as many of your players do I had as lief the,10
too much with your hand thus but use all gently;,10
the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget,10
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,10
very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who,10
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such,10
out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.,10
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion,10
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not,10
from the purpose of playing whose end both at the,10
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,10
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,10
laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve; the,10
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O there be,10
praise and that highly not to speak it profanely,10
the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so,10
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them,10
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,10
O reform it altogether. And let those that play,10
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to,10
too; though in the mean time some necessary,10
that's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition,10
Exeunt Players,10
How now my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?,10
Bid the players make haste.,10
Will you two help to hasten them?,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
Enter HORATIO,10
Horatio thou art e'en as just a man,10
O my dear lord--,10
For what advancement may I hope from thee,10
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?,10
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,10
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,10
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been,10
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards,10
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,10
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man,10
In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart,10
There is a play to-night before the king;,10
Which I have told thee of my father's death:,10
Even with the very comment of thy soul,10
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,10
And my imaginations are as foul,10
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,10
In censure of his seeming.,10
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,10
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:,10
Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS  QUEEN GERTRUDE POLONIUS OPHELIA ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and others,10
Excellent i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat,10
I have nothing with this answer Hamlet; these words,10
No nor mine now.,10
My lord you played once i' the university you say?,10
What did you enact?,10
Capitol; Brutus killed me.,10
there. Be the players ready?,10
Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me.,10
[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O ho! do you mark that?,10
Lying down at OPHELIA's feet,10
I mean my head upon your lap?,10
Do you think I meant country matters?,10
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.,10
Nothing.,10
Who I?,10
O God your only jig-maker. What should a man do,10
mother looks and my father died within these two hours.,10
So long? Nay then let the devil wear black for,10
months ago and not forgotten yet? Then there's,10
a year: but by'r lady he must build churches,10
the hobby-horse whose epitaph is 'For O for O,10
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters,10
Exeunt,10
Marry this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.,10
Enter Prologue,10
keep counsel; they'll tell all.,10
Ay or any show that you'll show him: be not you,10
You are naught you are naught: I'll mark the play.,10
Here stooping to your clemency,10
Exit,10
Tis brief my lord.,10
Enter two Players King and Queen,10
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,10
About the world have times twelve thirties been,10
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.,10
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!,10
So far from cheer and from your former state,10
Discomfort you my lord it nothing must:,10
In neither aught or in extremity.,10
And as my love is sized my fear is so:,10
Where little fears grow great great love grows there.,10
My operant powers their functions leave to do:,10
Honour'd beloved; and haply one as kind,10
O confound the rest!,10
In second husband let me be accurst!,10
[Aside]  Wormwood wormwood.,10
Are base respects of thrift but none of love:,10
When second husband kisses me in bed.,10
But what we do determine oft we break.,10
Of violent birth but poor validity;,10
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.,10
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:,10
The passion ending doth the purpose lose.,10
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:,10
Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident.,10
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;,10
Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love.,10
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.,10
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,10
Directly seasons him his enemy.,10
Our wills and fates do so contrary run,10
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own:,10
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.,10
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!,10
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!,10
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!,10
If once a widow ever I be wife!,10
Tis deeply sworn. Sweet leave me here awhile;,10

This is one Lucianus nephew to the king.,10
I could interpret between you and your love if I,10
You are keen my lord you are keen.,10
Still better and worse.,10
pox leave thy damnable faces and begin. Come:,10
Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing;,10
Thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected,10
Thy natural magic and dire property,10
Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears,10

What frighted with false fire!,10
Give o'er the play.,10
Lights lights lights!,10
Why let the stricken deer go weep,10
For some must watch while some must sleep:,10
Would not this sir and a forest of feathers-- if,10
Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a,10
Half a share.,10
For thou dost know O Damon dear,10
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here,10
You might have rhymed.,10

Upon the talk of the poisoning?,10
Ah ha! Come some music! come the recorders!,10
Why then belike he likes it not perdy.,10
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
Sir a whole history.,10
Ay sir what of him?,10
With drink sir?,10
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to,10

Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and,10
I am tame sir: pronounce.,10
spirit hath sent me to you.,10
Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right,10
wholesome answer I will do your mother's,10
shall be the end of my business.,10
What my lord?,10
sir such answer as I can make you shall command;,10
more but to the matter: my mother you say--,10
into amazement and admiration.,10
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's,10
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you,10
We shall obey were she ten times our mother. Have,10
My lord you once did love me.,10
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper? you,10
you deny your griefs to your friend.,10
How can that be when you have the voice of the king,10
Ay but sir 'While the grass grows'--the proverb,10
Re-enter Players with recorders,10
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,10
O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too,10
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon,10
My lord I cannot.,10
Believe me I cannot.,10
I know no touch of it my lord.,10
your lingers and thumb give it breath with your,10
Look you these are the stops.,10
harmony; I have not the skill.,10
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know,10
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to,10
excellent voice in this little organ; yet cannot,10
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what,10
cannot play upon me.,10
God bless you sir!,10
presently.,10
By the mass and 'tis like a camel indeed.,10
It is backed like a weasel.,10
Very like a whale.,10
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.,10
By and by is easily said.,10
Leave me friends.,10
Tis now the very witching time of night,10
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,10
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.,10
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:,10
I will speak daggers to her but use none;,10
How in my words soever she be shent,10
Exit,10
Enter KING CLAUDIUS ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;,10
And he to England shall along with you:,10
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow,10
We will ourselves provide:,10
To keep those many many bodies safe,10
The single and peculiar life is bound,10
To keep itself from noyance; but much more,10
The lives of many. The cease of majesty,10
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,10
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things,10
Each small annexment petty consequence,10
Did the king sigh but with a general groan.,10
For we will fetters put upon this fear,10
We will haste us.,10
Enter POLONIUS,10
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,10
And as you said and wisely was it said,10
Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear,10
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,10
Thanks dear my lord.,10
O my offence is rank it smells to heaven;,10
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,10
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;,10
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,10
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,10
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy,10
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,10
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;,10
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?,10
Of those effects for which I did the murder,10
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?,10
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,10
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;,10
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,10
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?,10
Yet what can it when one can not repent?,10
O limed soul that struggling to be free,10
Bow stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,10
All may be well.,10
Enter HAMLET,10
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;,10
A villain kills my father; and for that,10
To heaven.,10
He took my father grossly full of bread;,10
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?,10
Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,10
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?,10
Up sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:,10
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;,10
That has no relish of salvation in't;,10
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black,10
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.,10
[Rising]  My words fly up my thoughts remain below:,10
Exit,10
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS,10
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,10
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.,10
[Within]  Mother mother mother!,10
Fear me not: withdraw I hear him coming.,10
Enter HAMLET,10
Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended.,10
Come come you answer with an idle tongue.,10
Why how now Hamlet!,10
Have you forgot me?,10
You are the queen your husband's brother's wife;,10
Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak.,10
You go not till I set you up a glass,10
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?,10
[Behind]  What ho! help help help!,10
Makes a pass through the arras,10
Falls and dies,10
Nay I know not:,10
O what a rash and bloody deed is this!,10
As kill a king and marry with his brother.,10
Ay lady 'twas my word.,10
Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell!,10
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.,10
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,10
If damned custom have not brass'd it so,10
What have I done that thou darest wag thy tongue,10
Such an act,10
Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose,10
And sets a blister there makes marriage-vows,10
As from the body of contraction plucks,10
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:,10
With tristful visage as against the doom,10
Ay me what act,10
Look here upon this picture and on this,10
See what a grace was seated on this brow;,10
An eye like Mars to threaten and command;,10
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;,10
Where every god did seem to set his seal,10
This was your husband. Look you now what follows:,10
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?,10
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?,10
The hey-day in the blood is tame it's humble,10
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,10
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,10
But it reserved some quantity of choice,10
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?,10
Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all,10
Could not so mope.,10
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,10
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame,10
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,10
O Hamlet speak no more:,10
And there I see such black and grained spots,10
Nay but to live,10
Stew'd in corruption honeying and making love,10
O speak to me no more;,10
No more sweet Hamlet!,10
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe,10
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,10
And put it in his pocket!,10
A king of shreds and patches--,10
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,10
Alas he's mad!,10
That lapsed in time and passion lets go by,10
Do not forget: this visitation,10
But look amazement on thy mother sits:,10
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:,10
How is it with you lady?,10
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,10
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;,10
Your bedded hair like life in excrements,10
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper,10
On him on him! Look you how pale he glares!,10
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;,10
My stern effects: then what I have to do,10
To whom do you speak this?,10
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.,10
No nothing but ourselves.,10
My father in his habit as he lived!,10
Exit Ghost,10
This bodiless creation ecstasy,10
Ecstasy!,10
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness,10
And I the matter will re-word; which madness,10
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,10
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,10
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;,10
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,10
For in the fatness of these pursy times,10
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good.,10
O throw away the worser part of it,10
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;,10
That monster custom who all sense doth eat,10
That to the use of actions fair and good,10
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,10
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;,10
And either [         ] the devil or throw him out,10
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,10
Pointing to POLONIUS,10
To punish me with this and this with me,10
I will bestow him and will answer well,10
I must be cruel only to be kind:,10
One word more good lady.,10
Not this by no means that I bid you do:,10
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;,10
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,10
That I essentially am not in madness,10
For who that's but a queen fair sober wise,10
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?,10
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.,10
To try conclusions in the basket creep,10
Be thou assured if words be made of breath,10
What thou hast said to me.,10
Alack,10
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,10
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,10
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer,10
But I will delve one yard below their mines,10
When in one line two crafts directly meet.,10
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.,10
Is now most still most secret and most grave,10
Come sir to draw toward an end with you.,10
Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS,10
SCENE I. A room in the castle.,10
There's matter in these sighs these profound heaves:,10
Where is your son?,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
What Gertrude? How does Hamlet?,10
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,10
Whips out his rapier cries 'A rat a rat!',10
The unseen good old man.,10
It had been so with us had we been there:,10
To you yourself to us to every one.,10
It will be laid to us whose providence,10
This mad young man: but so much was our love,10
But like the owner of a foul disease,10
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?,10
O'er whom his very madness like some ore,10
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.,10
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,10
We must with all our majesty and skill,10
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,10
Go seek him out; speak fair and bring the body,10
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
And let them know both what we mean to do,10
My soul is full of discord and dismay.,10
SCENE II. Another room in the castle.,10
Safely stowed.,10
GUILDENSTERN:,10
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?,10
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN,10
Compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin.,10
And bear it to the chapel.,10
Believe what?,10
Besides to be demanded of a sponge! what,10
Take you me for a sponge my lord?,10
rewards his authorities. But such officers do the,10
an ape in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed to,10
gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you,10
I understand you not my lord.,10
foolish ear.,10
with us to the king.,10
the body. The king is a thing--,10
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox and all after.,10
SCENE III. Another room in the castle.,10
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.,10
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:,10
Who like not in their judgment but their eyes;,10
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,10
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown,10
Or not at all.,10
How now! what hath befall'n?,10
We cannot get from him.,10
Without my lord; guarded to know your pleasure.,10
Ho Guildenstern! bring in my lord.,10
Now Hamlet where's Polonius?,10
At supper! where?,10
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your,10
creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for,10
variable service two dishes but to one table:,10
Alas alas!,10
king and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.,10
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a,10
Where is Polonius?,10
find him not there seek him i' the other place,10
this month you shall nose him as you go up the,10
Go seek him there.,10
He will stay till ye come.,10
Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety--,10
For that which thou hast done--must send thee hence,10
The bark is ready and the wind at help,10
For England.,10
Ay Hamlet.,10
So is it if thou knew'st our purposes.,10
England! Farewell dear mother.,10
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man,10
Exit,10
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:,10
That else leans on the affair: pray you make haste.,10
And England if my love thou hold'st at aught--,10
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red,10
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set,10
By letters congruing to that effect,10
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,10
Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun.,10
SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.,10
Go captain from me greet the Danish king;,10
Craves the conveyance of a promised march,10
If that his majesty would aught with us,10
And let him know so.,10
Go softly on.,10
Enter HAMLET ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and others,10
They are of Norway sir.,10
Against some part of Poland.,10
The nephews to old Norway Fortinbras.,10
Or for some frontier?,10
We go to gain a little patch of ground,10
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it;,10
A ranker rate should it be sold in fee.,10
Yes it is already garrison'd.,10
Will not debate the question of this straw:,10
That inward breaks and shows no cause without,10
God be wi' you sir.,10
Wilt please you go my lord?,10
Exeunt all except HAMLET,10
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,10
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast no more.,10
Looking before and after gave us not,10
To fust in us unused. Now whether it be,10
Of thinking too precisely on the event,10
And ever three parts coward I do not know,10
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means,10
Witness this army of such mass and charge,10
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd,10
Exposing what is mortal and unsure,10
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great,10
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,10
That have a father kill'd a mother stain'd,10
And let all sleep? while to my shame I see,10
That for a fantasy and trick of fame,10
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,10
To hide the slain? O from this time forth,10
Exit,10
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE HORATIO and a Gentleman,10
She is importunate indeed distract:,10
What would she have?,10
There's tricks i' the world; and hems and beats her heart;,10
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,10
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,10
Which as her winks and nods and gestures,10
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,10
Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew,10
Let her come in.,10
To my sick soul as sin's true nature is,10
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,10
Re-enter HORATIO with OPHELIA,10
How now Ophelia!,10
How should I your true love know,10
By his cockle hat and staff,10
Alas sweet lady what imports this song?,10
Sings,10
He is dead and gone;,10
At his heels a stone.,10
Pray you mark.,10
White his shroud as the mountain snow--,10
Alas look here my lord.,10
Larded with sweet flowers,10
With true-love showers.,10
Well God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's,10
what we may be. God be at your table!,10
Pray you let's have no words of this; but when they,10
Sings,10
All in the morning betime,10
To be your Valentine.,10
And dupp'd the chamber-door;,10
Never departed more.,10
Indeed la without an oath I'll make an end on't:,10
By Gis and by Saint Charity,10
Young men will do't if they come to't;,10
Quoth she before you tumbled me,10
So would I ha' done by yonder sun,10
How long hath she been thus?,10
cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him,10
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come my,10
good night good night.,10
Follow her close; give her good watch,10
Exit HORATIO,10
All from her father's death. O Gertrude Gertrude,10
But in battalions. First her father slain:,10
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,10
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,10
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,10
Last and as much containing as all these,10
Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds,10
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;,10
Will nothing stick our person to arraign,10
Like to a murdering-piece in many places,10
A noise within,10
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.,10
What is the matter?,10
The ocean overpeering of his list,10
Than young Laertes in a riotous head,10
And as the world were now but to begin,10
The ratifiers and props of every word,10
Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds:,10
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!,10
The doors are broke.,10
Enter LAERTES armed; Danes following,10
No let's come in.,10
We will we will.,10
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,10
Calmly good Laertes.,10
Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot,10
Of my true mother.,10
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?,10
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,10
Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,10
Speak man.,10
Dead.,10
Let him demand his fill.,10
To hell allegiance! vows to the blackest devil!,10
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,10
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged,10
Who shall stay you?,10
And for my means I'll husband them so well,10
Good Laertes,10
Of your dear father's death is't writ in your revenge,10
Winner and loser?,10
Will you know them then?,10
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,10
Why now you speak,10
That I am guiltless of your father's death,10
It shall as level to your judgment pierce,10
[Within]                Let her come in.,10
Re-enter OPHELIA,10
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!,10
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!,10
O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits,10
Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine,10
After the thing it loves.,10
They bore him barefaced on the bier;,10
And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--,10
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,10
[Sings],10
An you call him a-down-a.,10
steward that stole his master's daughter.,10
There's rosemary that's for remembrance; pray,10
A document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted.,10
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it,10
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you,10
died: they say he made a good end--,10
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.,10
She turns to favour and to prettiness.,10
And will he not come again?,10
No no he is dead:,10
He never will come again.,10
All flaxen was his poll:,10
And we cast away moan:,10
And of all Christian souls I pray God. God be wi' ye.,10
Do you see this O God?,10
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,10
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:,10
They find us touch'd we will our kingdom give,10
To you in satisfaction; but if not,10
And we shall jointly labour with your soul,10
Let this be so;,10
No trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones,10
Cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth,10
So you shall;,10
I pray you go with me.,10
SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.,10
What are they that would speak with me?,10
Let them come in.,10
I do not know from what part of the world,10
Enter Sailors,10
Let him bless thee too.,10
you sir; it comes from the ambassador that was,10
let to know it is.,10
this give these fellows some means to the king:,10
at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us,10
a compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded,10
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with,10
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king,10
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I,10
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of,10
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their,10
thee. Farewell.,10
Come I will make you way for these your letters;,10
To him from whom you brought them.,10
SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.,10
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,10
Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear,10
Pursued my life.,10
Why you proceeded not against these feats,10
As by your safety wisdom all things else,10
O for two special reasons;,10
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother,10
My virtue or my plague be it either which--,10
That as the star moves not but in his sphere,10
Why to a public count I might not go,10
Who dipping all his faults in their affection,10
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,10
Would have reverted to my bow again,10
And so have I a noble father lost;,10
Whose worth if praises may go back again,10
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.,10
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull,10
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:,10
And that I hope will teach you to imagine--,10
How now! what news?,10
This to your majesty; this to the queen.,10
Sailors my lord they say; I saw them not:,10
Of him that brought them.,10
Exit Messenger,10
High and mighty You shall know I am set naked on,10
your kingly eyes: when I shall first asking your,10
and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.',10
Or is it some abuse and no such thing?,10
Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!,10
Can you advise me?,10
It warms the very sickness in my heart,10
Thus didest thou.',10
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--,10
Ay my lord;,10
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,10
No more to undertake it I will work him,10
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:,10
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise,10
My lord I will be ruled;,10
That I might be the organ.,10
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,10
Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts,10
As did that one and that in my regard,10
What part is that my lord?,10
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes,10
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,10
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--,10
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant,10
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,10
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,10
Come short of what he did.,10
A Norman.,10
The very same.,10
And gem of all the nation.,10
And gave you such a masterly report,10
And for your rapier most especially,10
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,10
If you opposed them. Sir this report of his,10
That he could nothing do but wish and beg,10
Now out of this--,10
Laertes was your father dear to you?,10
A face without a heart?,10
Not that I think you did not love your father;,10
And that I see in passages of proof,10
There lives within the very flame of love,10
And nothing is at a like goodness still;,10
Dies in his own too much: that we would do,10
And hath abatements and delays as many,10
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,10
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,10
More than in words?,10
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize;,10
Will you do this keep close within your chamber.,10
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence,10
The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together,10
Most generous and free from all contriving,10
Or with a little shuffling you may choose,10
Requite him for your father.,10
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.,10
So mortal that but dip a knife in it,10
Collected from all simples that have virtue,10
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point,10
It may be death.,10
Weigh what convenience both of time and means,10
And that our drift look through our bad performance,10
Should have a back or second that might hold,10
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.,10
As make your bouts more violent to that end--,10
A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping,10
Our purpose may hold there.,10
How now sweet queen!,10
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd Laertes.,10
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,10
There with fantastic garlands did she come,10
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,10
There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds,10
When down her weedy trophies and herself,10
And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up:,10
As one incapable of her own distress,10
Unto that element: but long it could not be,10
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay,10
Alas then she is drown'd?,10
Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia,10
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,10
The woman will be out. Adieu my lord:,10
But that this folly douts it.,10
Let's follow Gertrude:,10
Now fear I this will give it start again;,10
Exeunt,10
SCENE I. A churchyard.,10
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that,10
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave,10
Christian burial.,10
own defence?,10
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For,10
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it,10
herself wittingly.,10
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here,10
and drown himself it is will he nill he he,10
and drown him he drowns not himself: argal he,10
But is this law?,10
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been,10
Christian burial.,10
great folk should have countenance in this world to,10
Christian. Come my spade. There is no ancient,10
they hold up Adam's profession.,10
He was the first that ever bore arms.,10
What art a heathen? How dost thou understand the,10
could he dig without arms? I'll put another,10
purpose confess thyself--,10
What is he that builds stronger than either the,10
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a,10
I like thy wit well in good faith: the gallows,10
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the,10
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again come.,10
a carpenter?',10
Marry now I can tell.,10
Mass I cannot tell.,10
Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull,10
you are asked this question next say 'a,10
doomsday. Go get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a,10
Exit Second Clown,10
In youth when I did love did love,10
To contract O the time for ah my behove,10
Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he,10
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.,10
the daintier sense.,10
But age with his stealing steps,10
And hath shipped me intil the land,10
Throws up a skull,10
how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were,10
might be the pate of a politician which this ass,10
might it not?,10
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,10
be my lord such-a-one that praised my lord,10
Ay my lord.,10
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:,10
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,10
[Sings],10
For and a shrouding sheet:,10
For such a guest is meet.,10
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a,10
his cases his tenures and his tricks? why does he,10
sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of,10
in's time a great buyer of land with his statutes,10
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines and,10
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him,10
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The,10
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more ha?,10
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?,10
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance,10
grave's this sirrah?,10
Sings,10
For such a guest is meet.,10
You lie out on't sir and therefore it is not,10
Thou dost lie in't to be in't and say it is thine:,10
Tis a quick lie sir; 'twill away gain from me to,10
What man dost thou dig it for?,10
What woman then?,10
Who is to be buried in't?,10
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the,10
Horatio these three years I have taken a note of,10
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he,10
grave-maker?,10
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.,10
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it,10
is mad and sent into England.,10
Why because he was mad: he shall recover his wits,10
Why?,10
are as mad as he.,10
Very strangely they say.,10
Faith e'en with losing his wits.,10
Why here in Denmark: I have been sexton here man,10
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?,10
have many pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce,10
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.,10
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that,10
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.,10
three and twenty years.,10
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?,10
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a,10
sir was Yorick's skull the king's jester.,10
E'en that.,10
Takes the skull,10
of infinite jest of most excellent fancy: he hath,10
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at,10
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your,10
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one,10
Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let,10
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee Horatio tell,10
What's that my lord?,10
the earth?,10
And smelt so? pah!,10
E'en so my lord.,10
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,10
Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.,10
modesty enough and likelihood to lead it: as,10
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of,10
was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?,10
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:,10
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!,10
Enter Priest  and c. in procession; the Corpse of  OPHELIA LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE their trains  and c,10
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,10
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.,10
Retiring with HORATIO,10
That is Laertes,10
What ceremony else?,10
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;,10
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged,10
Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;,10
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home,10
Must there no more be done?,10
We should profane the service of the dead,10
As to peace-parted souls.,10
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh,10
A ministering angel shall my sister be,10
What the fair Ophelia!,10
Scattering flowers,10
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd sweet maid,10
O treble woe,10
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense,10
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:,10
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,10
To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head,10
[Advancing]     What is he whose grief,10
Conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand,10
Hamlet the Dane.,10
The devil take thy soul!,10
Thou pray'st not well.,10
For though I am not splenitive and rash,10
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.,10
Hamlet Hamlet!,10
Good my lord be quiet.,10
Why I will fight with him upon this theme,10
O my son what theme?,10
Could not with all their quantity of love,10
O he is mad Laertes.,10
Swounds show me what thou'lt do:,10
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?,10
To outface me with leaping in her grave?,10
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw,10
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,10
I'll rant as well as thou.,10
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;,10
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,10
Hear you sir;,10
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;,10
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.,10
I pray you good Horatio wait upon him.,10
To LAERTES,10
We'll put the matter to the present push.,10
This grave shall have a living monument:,10
Till then in patience our proceeding be.,10
SCENE II. A hall in the castle.,10
So much for this sir: now shall you see the other;,10
Remember it my lord?,10
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay,10
And praised be rashness for it let us know,10
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us,10
Rough-hew them how we will--,10
Up from my cabin,10
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.,10
To mine own room again; making so bold,10
Their grand commission; where I found Horatio--,10
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,10
With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,10
No not to stay the grinding of the axe,10
Is't possible?,10
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?,10
Being thus be-netted round with villanies--,10
They had begun the play--I sat me down,10
I once did hold it as our statists do,10
How to forget that learning but sir now,10
The effect of what I wrote?,10
An earnest conjuration from the king,10
As love between them like the palm might flourish,10
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,10
That on the view and knowing of these contents,10
He should the bearers put to sudden death,10
How was this seal'd?,10
I had my father's signet in my purse,10
Folded the writ up in form of the other,10
The changeling never known. Now the next day,10
Thou know'st already.,10
Why man they did make love to this employment;,10
Does by their own insinuation grow:,10
Between the pass and fell incensed points,10
Why what a king is this!,10
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,10
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,10
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,10
In further evil?,10
What is the issue of the business there.,10
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.',10
That to Laertes I forgot myself;,10
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.,10
Into a towering passion.,10
Enter OSRIC,10
I humbly thank you sir. Dost know this water-fly?,10
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to,10
beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at,10
spacious in the possession of dirt.,10
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.,10
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.,10
No believe me 'tis very cold; the wind is,10
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed.,10
complexion.,10
twere--I cannot tell how. But my lord his,10
great wager on your head: sir this is the matter--,10
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat,10
Sir here is newly come to court Laertes; believe,10
differences of very soft society and great showing:,10
calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the,10
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you;,10
dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw,10
verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of,10
rareness as to make true diction of him his,10
him his umbrage nothing more.,10
The concernancy sir? why do we wrap the gentleman,10
Sir?,10
You will do't sir really.,10
Of Laertes?,10
Of him sir.,10
I would you did sir; yet in faith if you did,10
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--,10
him in excellence; but to know a man well were to,10
I mean sir for his weapon; but in the imputation,10
What's his weapon?,10
That's two of his weapons: but well.,10
horses: against the which he has imponed as I take,10
assigns as girdle hangers and so: three of the,10
responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages,10
What call you the carriages?,10
The carriages sir are the hangers.,10
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might,10
against six French swords their assigns and three,10
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed' as you call it?,10
between yourself and him he shall not exceed you,10
would come to immediate trial if your lordship,10
How if I answer 'no'?,10
Sir I will walk here in the hall: if it please his,10
the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the,10
if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.,10
To this effect sir; after what flourish your nature will.,10
Yours yours.,10
He does well to commend it himself; there are no,10
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.,10
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I,10
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of,10
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do,10
Enter a Lord,10
Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in,10
play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.,10
pleasure: if his fitness speaks mine is ready; now,10
The king and queen and all are coming down.,10
The queen desires you to use some gentle,10
She well instructs me.,10
You will lose this wager my lord.,10
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the,10
about my heart: but it is no matter.,10
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of,10
If your mind dislike any thing obey it: I will,10
fit.,10
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,10
now; if it be not now yet it will come: the,10
leaves what is't to leave betimes?,10
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me.,10
Give me your pardon sir: I've done you wrong;,10
This presence knows,10
With sore distraction. What I have done,10
Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness.,10
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,10
Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it.,10
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;,10
Sir in this audience,10
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,10
And hurt my brother.,10
Whose motive in this case should stir me most,10
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,10
I have a voice and precedent of peace,10
I do receive your offer'd love like love,10
I embrace it freely;,10
Give us the foils. Come on.,10
I'll be your foil Laertes: in mine ignorance,10
Stick fiery off indeed.,10
No by this hand.,10
You know the wager?,10
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.,10
But since he is better'd we have therefore odds.,10
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?,10
Ay my good lord.,10
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,10
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:,10
And in the cup an union shall he throw,10
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;,10
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,10
Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come begin:,10
Come on sir.,10
They play,10
No.,10
A hit a very palpable hit.,10
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet this pearl is thine;,10
Trumpets sound and cannon shot off within,10
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.,10
Another hit; what say you?,10
Our son shall win.,10
Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows;,10
Good madam!,10
I will my lord; I pray you pardon me.,10
I dare not drink yet madam; by and by.,10
My lord I'll hit him now.,10
[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.,10
I pray you pass with your best violence;,10
Say you so? come on.,10
Nothing neither way.,10
LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling they change rapiers and HAMLET wounds LAERTES,10
Nay come again.,10
Look to the queen there ho!,10
How is't Laertes?,10
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.,10
She swounds to see them bleed.,10
The drink the drink! I am poison'd.,10
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:,10
It is here Hamlet: Hamlet thou art slain;,10
In thee there is not half an hour of life;,10
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise,10
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:,10
The point!--envenom'd too!,10
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS,10
O yet defend me friends; I am but hurt.,10
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?,10
KING CLAUDIUS dies,10
It is a poison temper'd by himself.,10
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,10
Dies,10
I am dead Horatio. Wretched queen adieu!,10
That are but mutes or audience to this act,10
Is strict in his arrest--O I could tell you--,10
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright,10
Never believe it:,10
Here's yet some liquor left.,10
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven I'll have't.,10
Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me!,10
Absent thee from felicity awhile,10
To tell my story.,10
What warlike noise is this?,10
To the ambassadors of England gives,10
O I die Horatio;,10
I cannot live to hear the news from England;,10
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;,10
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.,10
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:,10
Why does the drum come hither?,10
Enter FORTINBRAS the English Ambassadors and others,10
What is it ye would see?,10
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,10
That thou so many princes at a shot,10
The sight is dismal;,10
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,10
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:,10
Not from his mouth,10
He never gave commandment for their death.,10
You from the Polack wars and you from England,10
High on a stage be placed to the view;,10
How these things came about: so shall you hear,10
Of accidental judgments casual slaughters,10
And in this upshot purposes mistook,10
Truly deliver.,10
And call the noblest to the audience.,10
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,10
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,10
But let this same be presently perform'd,10
On plots and errors happen.,10
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;,10
To have proved most royally: and for his passage,10
Speak loudly for him.,10
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.,10
A dead march. Exeunt bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off,10
PROLOGUE,11
O for a Muse of fire that would ascend,11
A kingdom for a stage princes to act,11
Then should the warlike Harry like himself,11
Leash'd in like hounds should famine sword and fire,11
The flat unraised spirits that have dared,11
So great an object: can this cockpit hold,11
Within this wooden O the very casques,11
O pardon! since a crooked figure may,11
And let us ciphers to this great accompt,11
Suppose within the girdle of these walls,11
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts,11
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;,11
And make imaginary puissance;,11
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;,11
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,11
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,11
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,11
Exit,11
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY,11
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign,11
But that the scambling and unquiet time,11
But how my lord shall we resist it now?,11
We lose the better half of our possession:,11
By testament have given to the church,11
As much as would maintain to the king's honour,11
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;,11
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.,11
And to the coffers of the king beside,11
This would drink deep.,11
But what prevention?,11
And a true lover of the holy church.,11
The breath no sooner left his father's body,11
Seem'd to die too; yea at that very moment,11
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,11
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.,11
Never came reformation in a flood,11
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness,11
As in this king.,11
Hear him but reason in divinity,11
You would desire the king were made a prelate:,11
You would say it hath been all in all his study:,11
A fearful battle render'd you in music:,11
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,11
The air a charter'd libertine is still,11
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;,11
Must be the mistress to this theoric:,11
Since his addiction was to courses vain,11
His hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports,11
Any retirement any sequestration,11
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,11
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:,11
Under the veil of wildness; which no doubt,11
Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.,11
And therefore we must needs admit the means,11
But my good lord,11
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty,11
He seems indifferent,11
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;,11
Upon our spiritual convocation,11
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,11
Than ever at one time the clergy yet,11
How did this offer seem received my lord?,11
Save that there was not time enough to hear,11
The severals and unhidden passages,11
And generally to the crown and seat of France,11
What was the impediment that broke this off?,11
Craved audience; and the hour I think is come,11
It is.,11
Which I could with a ready guess declare,11
I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it.,11
SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.,11
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?,11
Send for him good uncle.,11
Not yet my cousin: we would be resolved,11
That task our thoughts concerning us and France.,11
God and his angels guard your sacred throne,11
Sure we thank you.,11
And justly and religiously unfold,11
Or should or should not bar us in our claim:,11
That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading,11
With opening titles miscreate whose right,11
For God doth know how many now in health,11
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.,11
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:,11
For never two such kingdoms did contend,11
Are every one a woe a sore complaint,11
That make such waste in brief mortality.,11
For we will hear note and believe in heart,11
As pure as sin with baptism.,11
That owe yourselves your lives and services,11
To make against your highness' claim to France,11
In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:',11
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze,11
The founder of this law and female bar.,11
That the land Salique is in Germany,11
Where Charles the Great having subdued the Saxons,11
Who holding in disdain the German women,11
Establish'd then this law; to wit no female,11
Which Salique as I said 'twixt Elbe and Sala,11
Then doth it well appear that Salique law,11
Nor did the French possess the Salique land,11
After defunction of King Pharamond,11
Who died within the year of our redemption,11
Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French,11
Eight hundred five. Besides their writers say,11
Did as heir general being descended,11
Make claim and title to the crown of France.,11
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine sole heir male,11
To find his title with some shows of truth,11
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,11
To Lewis the emperor and Lewis the son,11
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,11
Wearing the crown of France till satisfied,11
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,11
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great,11
So that as clear as is the summer's sun.,11
King Lewis his satisfaction all appear,11
So do the kings of France unto this day;,11
To bar your highness claiming from the female,11
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles,11
May I with right and conscience make this claim?,11
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,11
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,11
Look back into your mighty ancestors:,11
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,11
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,11
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill,11
Forage in blood of French nobility.,11
With half their forces the full Pride of France,11
All out of work and cold for action!,11
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:,11
The blood and courage that renowned them,11
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,11
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth,11
As did the former lions of your blood.,11
So hath your highness; never king of England,11
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England,11
O let their bodies follow my dear liege,11
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty,11
As never did the clergy at one time,11
We must not only arm to invade the French,11
Against the Scot who will make road upon us,11
They of those marches gracious sovereign,11
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.,11
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,11
For you shall read that my great-grandfather,11
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom,11
With ample and brim fulness of his force,11
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;,11
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.,11
For hear her but exampled by herself:,11
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,11
But taken and impounded as a stray,11
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings,11
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea,11
But there's a saying very old and true,11
Then with Scotland first begin:',11
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot,11
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,11
It follows then the cat must stay at home:,11
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,11
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,11
For government though high and low and lower,11
Congreeing in a full and natural close,11
Therefore doth heaven divide,11
Setting endeavour in continual motion;,11
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,11
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.,11
Where some like magistrates correct at home,11
Others like soldiers armed in their stings,11
Which pillage they with merry march bring home,11
Who busied in his majesty surveys,11
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,11
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,11
Delivering o'er to executors pale,11
That many things having full reference,11
As many arrows loosed several ways,11
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;,11
So may a thousand actions once afoot.,11
Without defeat. Therefore to France my liege.,11
Whereof take you one quarter into France,11
If we with thrice such powers left at home,11
Let us be worried and our nation lose,11
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.,11
Now are we well resolved; and by God's help,11
France being ours we'll bend it to our awe,11
Ruling in large and ample empery,11
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,11
Either our history shall with full mouth,11
Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth,11
Enter Ambassadors of France,11
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear,11
May't please your majesty to give us leave,11
Or shall we sparingly show you far off,11
We are no tyrant but a Christian king;,11
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:,11
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.,11
Your highness lately sending into France,11
Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third.,11
Says that you savour too much of your youth,11
That can be with a nimble galliard won;,11
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit,11
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim,11
What treasure uncle?,11
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;,11
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,11
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.,11
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd,11
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,11
We never valued this poor seat of England;,11
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common,11
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,11
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:,11
And plodded like a man for working-days,11
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,11
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his,11
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance,11
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;,11
And some are yet ungotten and unborn,11
But this lies all within the will of God,11
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,11
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.,11
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,11
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.,11
This was a merry message.,11
Therefore my lords omit no happy hour,11
For we have now no thought in us but France,11
Therefore let our proportions for these wars,11
That may with reasonable swiftness add,11
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.,11
That this fair action may on foot be brought.,11
ACT II,11
Enter Chorus,11
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:,11
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:,11
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,11
For now sits Expectation in the air,11
With crowns imperial crowns and coronets,11
The French advised by good intelligence,11
Shake in their fear and with pale policy,11
O England! model to thy inward greatness,11
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do,11
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out,11
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,11
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third,11
Have for the gilt of France--O guilt indeed!,11
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,11
Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton.,11
The abuse of distance; force a play:,11
The king is set from London; and the scene,11
There is the playhouse now there must you sit:,11
And bring you back charming the narrow seas,11
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.,11
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.,11
SCENE I. London. A street.,11
Well met Corporal Nym.,11
What are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?,11
time shall serve there shall be smiles; but that,11
wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but,11
endure cold as another man's sword will: and,11
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and,11
be so good Corporal Nym.,11
certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer I,11
rendezvous of it.,11
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you,11
I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may,11
that time; and some say knives have edges. It must,11
she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well I,11
Enter PISTOL and Hostess,11
corporal be patient here. How now mine host Pistol!,11
I swear I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.,11
board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live,11
be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.,11
O well a day Lady if he be not drawn now! we,11
Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.,11
Pish for thee Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!,11
Will you shog off? I would have you solus.,11
The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;,11
And in thy hateful lungs yea in thy maw perdy,11
I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;,11
And flashing fire will follow.,11
humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow,11
rapier as I may in fair terms: if you would walk,11
terms as I may: and that's the humour of it.,11
The grave doth gape and doting death is near;,11
Hear me hear me what I say: he that strikes the,11
Draws,11
Give me thy fist thy fore-foot to me give:,11
I will cut thy throat one time or other in fair,11
Couple a gorge!',11
O hound of Crete think'st thou my spouse to get?,11
And from the powdering tub of infamy,11
Doll Tearsheet she by name and her espouse:,11
For the only she; and--pauca there's enough. Go to.,11
Mine host Pistol you must come to my master and,11
Good Bardolph put thy face between his sheets and,11
Away you rogue!,11
these days. The king has killed his heart. Good,11
Exeunt Hostess and Boy,11
France together: why the devil should we keep,11
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on!,11
Base is the slave that pays.,11
As manhood shall compound: push home.,11
By this sword he that makes the first thrust I'll,11
Sword is an oath and oaths must have their course.,11
an thou wilt not why then be enemies with me too.,11
I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?,11
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,11
I'll live by Nym and Nym shall live by me;,11
Unto the camp and profits will accrue.,11
I shall have my noble?,11
Well then that's the humour of't.,11
As ever you came of women come in quickly to Sir,11
quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to,11
The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's,11
Nym thou hast spoke the right;,11
The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;,11
Let us condole the knight; for lambkins we will live.,11
Enter EXETER BEDFORD and WESTMORELAND,11
They shall be apprehended by and by.,11
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,11
The king hath note of all that they intend,11
Nay but the man that was his bedfellow,11
That he should for a foreign purse so sell,11
Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V SCROOP CAMBRIDGE GREY and Attendants,11
My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham,11
Think you not that the powers we bear with us,11
Doing the execution and the act,11
No doubt my liege if each man do his best.,11
We carry not a heart with us from hence,11
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish,11
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved,11
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness,11
True: those that were your father's enemies,11
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.,11
And shall forget the office of our hand,11
According to the weight and worthiness.,11
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,11
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,11
That rail'd against our person: we consider,11
And on his more advice we pardon him.,11
Let him be punish'd sovereign lest example,11
O let us yet be merciful.,11
Sir,11
After the taste of much correction.,11
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!,11
Shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye,11
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,11
And tender preservation of our person,11
Who are the late commissioners?,11
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.,11
And I my royal sovereign.,11
There yours Lord Scroop of Masham; and sir knight,11
Read them; and know I know your worthiness.,11
We will aboard to night. Why how now gentlemen!,11
So much complexion? Look ye how they change!,11
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood,11
I do confess my fault;,11
To which we all appeal.,11
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:,11
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,11
See you my princes and my noble peers,11
You know how apt our love was to accord,11
Belonging to his honour; and this man,11
And sworn unto the practises of France,11
This knight no less for bounty bound to us,11
What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop? thou cruel,11
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,11
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,11
May it be possible that foreign hire,11
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,11
As black and white my eye will scarcely see it.,11
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,11
That admiration did not whoop at them:,11
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:,11
That wrought upon thee so preposterously,11
All other devils that suggest by treasons,11
With patches colours and with forms being fetch'd,11
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,11
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.,11
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,11
And tell the legions 'I can never win,11
O how hast thou with 'jealousy infected,11
Why so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?,11
Why so didst thou: seem they religious?,11
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,11
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,11
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?,11
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,11
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;,11
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:,11
And God acquit them of their practises!,11
Richard Earl of Cambridge.,11
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.,11
Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland.,11
And I repent my fault more than my death;,11
Although my body pay the price of it.,11
Although I did admit it as a motive,11
But God be thanked for prevention;,11
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.,11
At the discovery of most dangerous treason,11
Prevented from a damned enterprise:,11
God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.,11
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers,11
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,11
His subjects to oppression and contempt,11
Touching our person seek we no revenge;,11
Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws,11
Poor miserable wretches to your death:,11
You patience to endure and true repentance,11
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded,11
Shall be to you as us like glorious.,11
Since God so graciously hath brought to light,11
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,11
Then forth dear countrymen: let us deliver,11
Putting it straight in expedition.,11
No king of England if not king of France.,11
SCENE III. London. Before a tavern.,11
Prithee honey-sweet husband let me bring thee to Staines.,11
Bardolph be blithe: Nym rouse thy vaunting veins:,11
And we must yearn therefore.,11
heaven or in hell!,11
bosom if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made,11
christom child; a' parted even just between twelve,11
I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with,11
there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as,11
sir John!' quoth I 'what man! be o' good,11
four times. Now I to comfort him bid him a',11
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So,11
hand into the bed and felt them and they were as,11
they were as cold as any stone and so upward and,11
They say he cried out of sack.,11
And of women.,11
Yes that a' did; and said they were devils,11
A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he,11
A' said once the devil would have him about women.,11
he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylon.,11
Bardolph's nose and a' said it was a black soul,11
Well the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:,11
Shall we shog? the king will be gone from,11
Come let's away. My love give me thy lips.,11
Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:',11
For oaths are straws men's faiths are wafer-cakes,11
Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor.,11
Let us to France; like horse-leeches my boys,11
And that's but unwholesome food they say.,11
Farewell hostess.,11
I cannot kiss that is the humour of it; but adieu.,11
Farewell; adieu.,11
SCENE IV. France. The KING'S palace.,11
Thus comes the English with full power upon us;,11
To answer royally in our defences.,11
Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth,11
To line and new repair our towns of war,11
For England his approaches makes as fierce,11
It fits us then to be as provident,11
Left by the fatal and neglected English,11
My most redoubted father,11
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,11
But that defences musters preparations,11
As were a war in expectation.,11
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:,11
No with no more than if we heard that England,11
For my good liege she is so idly king'd,11
By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth,11
O peace Prince Dauphin!,11
Question your grace the late ambassadors,11
How well supplied with noble counsellors,11
How terrible in constant resolution,11
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,11
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots,11
Well 'tis not so my lord high constable;,11
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh,11
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;,11
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting,11
Think we King Harry strong;,11
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;,11
That haunted us in our familiar paths:,11
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,11
Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales;,11
Up in the air crown'd with the golden sun,11
Mangle the work of nature and deface,11
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem,11
The native mightiness and fate of him.,11
Ambassadors from Harry King of England,11
We'll give them present audience. Go and bring them.,11
You see this chase is hotly follow'd friends.,11
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten,11
Take up the English short and let them know,11
Self-love my liege is not so vile a sin,11
Re-enter Lords with EXETER and train,11
From him; and thus he greets your majesty.,11
That you divest yourself and lay apart,11
By law of nature and of nations 'long,11
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain,11
Unto the crown of France. That you may know,11
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,11
He sends you this most memorable line,11
Willing to overlook this pedigree:,11
From his most famed of famous ancestors,11
Your crown and kingdom indirectly held,11
Or else what follows?,11
Even in your hearts there will he rake for it:,11
In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,11
And bids you in the bowels of the Lord,11
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war,11
Turning the widows' tears the orphans' cries,11
For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers,11
This is his claim his threatening and my message;,11
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.,11
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent,11
For the Dauphin,11
Scorn and defiance; slight regard contempt,11
The mighty sender doth he prize you at.,11
Do not in grant of all demands at large,11
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,11
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock,11
Say if my father render fair return,11
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,11
I did present him with the Paris balls.,11
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:,11
As we his subjects have in wonder found,11
And these he masters now: now he weighs time,11
In your own losses if he stay in France.,11
Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king,11
For he is footed in this land already.,11
A night is but small breath and little pause,11
Flourish. Exeunt,11
PROLOGUE,11
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies,11
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen,11
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet,11
Play with your fancies and in them behold,11
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give,11
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,11
Breasting the lofty surge: O do but think,11
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;,11
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow follow:,11
And leave your England as dead midnight still,11
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;,11
With one appearing hair that will not follow,11
Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege;,11
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.,11
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him,11
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.,11
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,11
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,11
Exit,11
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER and Soldiers with scaling-ladders,11
Or close the wall up with our English dead.,11
As modest stillness and humility:,11
Then imitate the action of the tiger;,11
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;,11
Let pry through the portage of the head,11
As fearfully as doth a galled rock,11
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.,11
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit,11
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!,11
Have in these parts from morn till even fought,11
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest,11
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,11
Whose limbs were made in England show us here,11
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;,11
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.,11
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:,11
Cry 'God for Harry England and Saint George!',11
SCENE II. The same.,11
On on on on on! to the breach to the breach!,11
and for mine own part I have not a case of lives:,11
plain-song of it.,11
Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;,11
In bloody field,11
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give,11
And I:,11
My purpose should not fail with me,11
As duly but not as truly,11
Enter FLUELLEN,11
Driving them forward,11
Abate thy rage abate thy manly rage,11
Good bawcock bate thy rage; use lenity sweet chuck!,11
Exeunt all but Boy,11
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they,11
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to,11
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out but,11
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks,11
heard that men of few words are the best men; and,11
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words,11
broke any man's head but his own and that was,11
any thing and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a,11
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn,11
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the,11
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their,11
if I should take from another's pocket to put into,11
must leave them and seek some better service:,11
therefore I must cast it up.,11
Re-enter FLUELLEN GOWER following,11
mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.,11
to come to the mines; for look you the mines is,11
concavities of it is not sufficient; for look you,11
you is digt himself four yard under the,11

It is Captain Macmorris is it not?,11
By Cheshu he is an ass as in the world: I will,11

Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY,11
Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,11
knowledge in th' aunchient wars upon my particular,11
maintain his argument as well as any military man in,11
of the Romans.,11
God-den to your worship good Captain James.,11
mines? have the pioneers given o'er?,11
over the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand I,11
it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town so,11
tish ill done; by my hand tish ill done!,11
voutsafe me look you a few disputations with you,11
the war the Roman wars in the way of argument,11
satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction,11
the military discipline; that is the point.,11
and I sall quit you with gud leve as I may pick,11
It is no time to discourse so Chrish save me: the,11
king and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The,11
breach; and we talk and be Chrish do nothing:,11

t as valourously as I may that sall I suerly do,11
fain hear some question 'tween you tway.,11
correction there is not many of your nation--,11
and a bastard and a knave and a rascal. What ish,11
Look you if you take the matter otherwise than is,11
you do not use me with that affability as in,11
good a man as yourself both in the disciplines of,11
other particularities.,11
Chrish save me I will cut off your head.,11
A! that's a foul fault.,11
The town sounds a parley.,11
opportunity to be required look you I will be so,11
and there is an end.,11
SCENE III. The same. Before the gates.,11
How yet resolves the governor of the town?,11
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;,11
Defy us to our worst: for as I am a soldier,11
If I begin the battery once again,11
Till in her ashes she lie buried.,11
And the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart,11
With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass,11
What is it then to me if impious war,11
Do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats,11
What is't to me when you yourselves are cause,11
Of hot and forcing violation?,11
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?,11
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil,11
To come ashore. Therefore you men of Harfleur,11
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;,11
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds,11
If not why in a moment look to see,11
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;,11
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,11
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused,11
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.,11
Or guilty in defence be thus destroy'd?,11
The Dauphin whom of succors we entreated,11
To raise so great a siege. Therefore great king,11
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;,11
Open your gates. Come uncle Exeter,11
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:,11
The winter coming on and sickness growing,11
To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;,11
Flourish. The King and his train enter the town,11
Enter KATHARINE and ALICE,11
Un peu madame.,11
parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglois?,11
De hand. Et les doigts?,11
souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont,11
La main de hand; les doigts de fingres. Je pense,11
d'Anglois vitement. Comment appelez-vous les ongles?,11
De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi si je parle bien: de,11
C'est bien dit madame; il est fort bon Anglois.,11
De arm madame.,11
De elbow.,11
mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.,11
Excusez-moi Alice; ecoutez: de hand de fingres,11
De elbow madame.,11
appelez-vous le col?,11
De nick. Et le menton?,11
De sin. Le col de nick; de menton de sin.,11
les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.,11
et en peu de temps.,11
Non je reciterai a vous promptement: de hand de,11
De nails madame.,11
Sauf votre honneur de elbow.,11
appelez-vous le pied et la robe?,11
De foot et de coun! O Seigneur Dieu! ce sont mots,11
non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais,11
pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le coun!,11
ensemble: de hand de fingres de nails de arm de,11
Excellent madame!,11
Exeunt,11
Enter the KING OF FRANCE the DAUPHIN the DUKE oF BOURBON the Constable Of France and others,11
And if he be not fought withal my lord,11
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.,11
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,11
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,11
Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards!,11
Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom,11
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.,11
Is not their climate foggy raw and dull,11
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,11
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?,11
Seem frosty? O for honour of our land,11
Upon our houses' thatch whiles a more frosty people,11
Poor we may call them in their native lords.,11
Our madams mock at us and plainly say,11
Their bodies to the lust of English youth,11
They bid us to the English dancing-schools,11
Saying our grace is only in our heels,11
Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:,11
Up princes! and with spirit of honour edged,11
Charles Delabreth high constable of France;,11
Alencon Brabant Bar and Burgundy;,11
Beaumont Grandpre Roussi and Fauconberg,11
High dukes great princes barons lords and knights,11
Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land,11
Rush on his host as doth the melted snow,11
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:,11
And in a captive chariot into Rouen,11
This becomes the great.,11
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,11
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,11
Therefore lord constable haste on Montjoy.,11
To know what willing ransom he will give.,11
Not so I do beseech your majesty.,11
Now forth lord constable and princes all,11
Exeunt,11
Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN meeting,11
I assure you there is very excellent services,11
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?,11
and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my,11
my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and,11
bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline.,11
pridge I think in my very conscience he is as,11
estimation in the world; but did see him do as,11
What do you call him?,11
I know him not.,11
Here is the man.,11
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.,11
his hands.,11
And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate,11
That goddess blind,11
By your patience Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is,11
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is,11
is the moral of it that she is turning and,11
foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone,11
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:,11
Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him;,11
A damned death!,11
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:,11
For pax of little price.,11
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut,11
Speak captain for his life and I will thee requite.,11
Why then rejoice therefore.,11
at: for if look you he were my brother I would,11
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.,11
It is well.,11
Exit,11
Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I,11
I'll assure you a' uttered as brave words at the,11
is very well; what he has spoke to me that is well,11
Why 'tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then,11
into London under the form of a soldier. And such,11
and they will learn you by rote where services were,11
at such a convoy; who came off bravely who was,11
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,11
a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of,11
ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on. But,11
else you may be marvellously mistook.,11
not the man that he would gladly make show to the,11
tell him my mind.,11
Hark you the king is coming and I must speak with,11
Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY GLOUCESTER and Soldiers,11
How now Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?,11
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is,11
prave passages; marry th' athversary was have,11
retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the,11
prave man.,11
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very,11
think the duke hath lost never a man but one that,11
Bardolph if your majesty know the man: his face is,11
fire: and his lips blows at his nose and it is like,11
but his nose is executed and his fire's out.,11
give express charge that in our marches through the,11
villages nothing taken but paid for none of the,11
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the,11
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY,11
Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?,11
Unfold it.,11
Though we seemed dead we did but sleep: advantage,11
could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we,11
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue and our voice,11
his weakness and admire our sufferance. Bid him,11
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we,11
weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under.,11
effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too,11
person kneeling at our feet but a weak and,11
tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his,11
my king and master; so much my office.,11
Montjoy.,11
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;,11
Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,11
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,11
My numbers lessened and those few I have,11
Who when they were in health I tell thee herald,11
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me God,11
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.,11
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,11
Yet God before tell him we will come on,11
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Montjoy.,11
If we may pass we will; if we be hinder'd,11
Discolour: and so Montjoy fare you well.,11
We would not seek a battle as we are;,11
So tell your master.,11
Exit,11
We are in God's hand brother not in theirs.,11
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,11
Exeunt,11
Enter the Constable of France the LORD RAMBURES ORLEANS DAUPHIN with others,11
You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.,11
Will it never be morning?,11
talk of horse and armour?,11
What a long night is this! I will not change my,11
Ca ha! he bounds from the earth as if his,11
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him I,11
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his,11
He's of the colour of the nutmeg.,11
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull,11
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts,11
may call beasts.,11
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the,11
No more cousin.,11
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary,11
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent,11
tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for,11
world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart,11
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:,11
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.,11
courser for my horse is my mistress.,11
Me well; which is the prescript praise and,11
Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly,11
So perhaps did yours.,11
O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,11
your straight strossers.,11
Be warned by me then: they that ride so and ride,11
my horse to my mistress.,11
I tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair.,11
to my mistress.,11
la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.,11
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.,11
to-night are those stars or suns upon it?,11
Some of them will fall to-morrow I hope.,11
That may be for you bear a many superfluously and,11
Even as your horse bears your praises; who would,11
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will,11
my way shall be paved with English faces.,11
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would,11
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?,11
Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.,11
The Dauphin longs for morning.,11
I think he will eat all he kills.,11
Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath.,11
Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.,11
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.,11
I was told that  by one that knows him better than,11
What's he?,11
not who knew it,11
By my faith sir but it is; never any body saw it,11
appears it will bate.,11
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.',11
Well placed: there stands your friend for the,11
pox of the devil.',11
fool's bolt is soon shot.',11
Tis not the first time you were overshot.,11
My lord high constable the English lie within,11
Who hath measured the ground?,11
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were,11
the dawning as we do.,11
England to mope with his fat-brained followers so,11
If the English had any apprehension they would run away.,11
intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy,11
That island of England breeds very valiant,11
Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a,11
rotten apples! You may as well say that's a,11
Just just; and the men do sympathize with the,11
their wits with their wives: and then give them,11
eat like wolves and fight like devils.,11
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs,11
come shall we about it?,11
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.,11
ACT IV,11
Enter Chorus,11
When creeping murmur and the poring dark,11
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night,11
That the fixed sentinels almost receive,11
Fire answers fire and through their paly flames,11
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs,11
The armourers accomplishing the knights,11
Give dreadful note of preparation:,11
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.,11
The confident and over-lusty French,11
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night,11
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,11
Sit patiently and inly ruminate,11
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats,11
So many horrid ghosts. O now who will behold,11
Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent,11
For forth he goes and visits all his host.,11
And calls them brothers friends and countrymen.,11
How dread an army hath enrounded him;,11
Unto the weary and all-watched night,11
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;,11
Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks:,11
His liberal eye doth give to every one,11
Behold as may unworthiness define,11
And so our scene must to the battle fly;,11
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,11
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,11
Exit,11
Enter KING HENRY BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER,11
The greater therefore should our courage be.,11
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,11
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,11
Besides they are our outward consciences,11
That we should dress us fairly for our end.,11
And make a moral of the devil himself.,11
Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham:,11
Were better than a churlish turf of France.,11
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.',11
Upon example; so the spirit is eased:,11
The organs though defunct and dead before,11
With casted slough and fresh legerity.,11
Commend me to the princes in our camp;,11
Desire them an to my pavilion.,11
Shall I attend your grace?,11
Go with my brothers to my lords of England:,11
And then I would no other company.,11
Exeunt all but KING HENRY,11
Enter PISTOL,11
A friend.,11
Or art thou base common and popular?,11
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?,11
As good a gentleman as the emperor.,11
The king's a bawcock and a heart of gold,11
Of parents good of fist most valiant.,11
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?,11
Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?,11
Know'st thou Fluellen?,11
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate,11
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,11
Art thou his friend?,11
The figo for thee then!,11
My name is Pistol call'd.,11
It sorts well with your fierceness.,11
Captain Fluellen!,11
the greatest admiration of the universal world when,11
wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to,11
find I warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle,11
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the,11
of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise.,11
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating,11
look you be an ass and a fool and a prating,11
I will speak lower.,11
Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN,11
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.,11
Brother John Bates is not that the morning which,11
I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire,11
We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think,11
A friend.,11
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.,11
pray you what thinks he of our estate?,11
washed off the next tide.,11
No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I,11
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the,11
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies,11
though his affections are higher mounted than ours,11
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we,11
as ours are: yet in reason no man should possess,11
it should dishearten his army.,11
believe as cold a night as 'tis he could wish,11
were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here.,11
I think he would not wish himself any where but,11
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be,11
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here,11
minds: methinks I could not die any where so,11
just and his quarrel honourable.,11
Ay or more than we should seek after; for we know,11
his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes,11
But if the cause be not good the king himself hath,11
arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join,11
such a place;' some swearing some crying for a,11
them some upon the debts they owe some upon their,11
well that die in a battle; for how can they,11
argument? Now if these men do not die well it,11
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of,11
So if a son that is by his father sent about,11
imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be,11
servant under his master's command transporting a,11
many irreconciled iniquities you may call the,11
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not,11
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of,11
they purpose their services. Besides there is no,11
the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all,11
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;,11
perjury; some making the wars their bulwark that,11
pillage and robbery. Now if these men have,11
though they can outstrip men they have no wings to,11
so that here men are punished for before-breach of,11
they feared the death they have borne life away;,11
they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of,11
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every,11
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in,11
mote out of his conscience: and dying so death,11
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:,11
that making God so free an offer He let him,11
others how they should prepare.,11
his own head the king is not to answer it.,11
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.,11
Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully: but,11
ne'er the wiser.,11
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an,11
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to,11
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word,11
Your reproof is something too round: I should be,11
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live.,11
How shall I know thee again?,11
bonnet: then if ever thou darest acknowledge it I,11
Here's my glove: give me another of thine.,11
This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come,11
by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.,11
Thou darest as well be hanged.,11
king's company.,11
Be friends you English fools be friends: we have,11
Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to,11
shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut,11
be a clipper.,11
Upon the king! let us our lives our souls,11
Our children and our sins lay on the king!,11
Twin-born with greatness subject to the breath,11
But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease,11
And what have kings that privates have not too,11
And what art thou thou idle ceremony?,11
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?,11
O ceremony show me but thy worth!,11
Art thou aught else but place degree and form,11
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd,11
What drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet,11
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!,11
With titles blown from adulation?,11
Canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee,11
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;,11
Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball,11
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,11
The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp,11
No not all these thrice-gorgeous ceremony,11
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,11
Gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread;,11
But like a lackey from the rise to set,11
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,11
And follows so the ever-running year,11
And but for ceremony such a wretch,11
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.,11
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots,11
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.,11
My lord your nobles jealous of your absence,11
Good old knight,11
I'll be before thee.,11
Exit,11
Possess them not with fear; take from them now,11
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day O Lord,11
My father made in compassing the crown!,11
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears,11
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,11
Toward heaven to pardon blood; and I have built,11
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;,11
Since that my penitence comes after all,11
Enter GLOUCESTER,11
My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;,11
The day my friends and all things stay for me.,11
SCENE II. The French camp.,11
The sun doth gild our armour; up my lords!,11
O brave spirit!,11
Rien puis? L'air et la feu.,11
Enter Constable,11
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh!,11
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,11
What will you have them weep our horses' blood?,11
Enter Messenger,11
To horse you gallant princes! straight to horse!,11
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,11
There is not work enough for all our hands;,11
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,11
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,11
Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions lords,11
Who in unnecessary action swarm,11
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,11
Took stand for idle speculation:,11
A very little little let us do.,11
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;,11
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.,11
Why do you stay so long my lords of France?,11
Ill-favouredly become the morning field:,11
And our air shakes them passing scornfully:,11
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:,11
With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades,11
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,11
Lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless;,11
Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour.,11
To demonstrate the life of such a battle,11
They have said their prayers and they stay for death.,11
And give their fasting horses provender,11
I stay but for my guidon: to the field!,11
And use it for my haste. Come come away!,11
Exeunt,11
Enter GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER ERPINGHAM with all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND,11
The king himself is rode to view their battle.,11
There's five to one; besides they all are fresh.,11

Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford,11
And my kind kinsman warriors all adieu!,11
Farewell kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:,11
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.,11
He is full of valour as of kindness;,11
Enter the KING,11
But one ten thousand of those men in England,11
What's he that wishes so?,11
If we are mark'd to die we are enow,11
The fewer men the greater share of honour.,11
By Jove I am not covetous for gold,11
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;,11
But if it be a sin to covet honour,11
No faith my coz wish not a man from England:,11
As one man more methinks would share from me,11
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host,11
Let him depart; his passport shall be made,11
We would not die in that man's company,11
This day is called the feast of Crispian:,11
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,11
He that shall live this day and see old age,11
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:',11
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.',11
But he'll remember with advantages,11
Familiar in his mouth as household words,11
Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester,11
This story shall the good man teach his son;,11
From this day to the ending of the world,11
We few we happy few we band of brothers;,11
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,11
And gentlemen in England now a-bed,11
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks,11
Re-enter SALISBURY,11
The French are bravely in their battles set,11
All things are ready if our minds be so.,11
Thou dost not wish more help from England coz?,11
Without more help could fight this royal battle!,11
Which likes me better than to wish us one.,11
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY,11
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,11
For certainly thou art so near the gulf,11
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind,11
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire,11
Must lie and fester.,11
The Constable of France.,11
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.,11
The man that once did sell the lion's skin,11
A many of our bodies shall no doubt,11
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:,11
Dying like men though buried in your dunghills,11
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;,11
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.,11
That being dead like to the bullet's grazing,11
Killing in relapse of mortality.,11
We are but warriors for the working-day;,11
With rainy marching in the painful field;,11
Good argument I hope we will not fly--,11
But by the mass our hearts are in the trim;,11
They'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck,11
And turn them out of service. If they do this--,11
Will soon be levied. Herald save thou thy labour;,11
They shall have none I swear but these my joints;,11
Shall yield them little tell the constable.,11
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.,11
I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.,11

Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.,11

Tell him my fury shall abate and I the crowns will take.,11
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner,11

Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et,11

had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i',11

good prey of us if he knew of it; for there is,11
Exit,11
Enter Constable ORLEANS BOURBON DAUPHIN and RAMBURES,11
O seigneur! le jour est perdu tout est perdu!,11
Reproach and everlasting shame,11
Do not run away.,11
Why all our ranks are broke.,11
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?,11
Shame and eternal shame nothing but shame!,11
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,11
Like a base pander hold the chamber-door,11
His fairest daughter is contaminated.,11
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.,11
To smother up the English in our throngs,11
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:,11
Exeunt,11
Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces EXETER and others,11
But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.,11
Lives he good uncle? thrice within this hour,11
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.,11
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,11
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.,11
Comes to him where in gore he lay insteep'd,11
That bloodily did spawn upon his face;,11
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;,11
As in this glorious and well-foughten field,11
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:,11
And with a feeble gripe says 'Dear my lord,11
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck,11
And so espoused to death with blood he seal'd,11
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced,11
But I had not so much of man in me,11
And gave me up to tears.,11
For hearing this I must perforce compound,11
Alarum,11
The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:,11
Give the word through.,11
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.,11
Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly,11

gallant king!,11

Why I pray you is not pig great? the pig or the,11
magnanimous are all one reckonings save the phrase,11
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his,11
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I,11
orld I warrant you sall find in the comparisons,11
look you is both alike. There is a river in,11
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is,11
river; but 'tis all one 'tis alike as my fingers is,11
mark Alexander's life well Harry of Monmouth's life,11
figures in all things. Alexander God knows and,11
wraths and his cholers and his moods and his,11
little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and,11
Our king is not like him in that: he never killed,11
It is not well done mark you now take the tales out,11
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as,11
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth being in,11

Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:,11
And not a man of them that we shall take,11
Enter MONTJOY,11
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.,11
That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?,11
No great king:,11
That we may wander o'er this bloody field,11
To sort our nobles from our common men.,11
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;,11
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds,11
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,11
To view the field in safety and dispose,11
I tell thee truly herald,11
For yet a many of your horsemen peer,11
The day is yours.,11
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?,11
Then call we this the field of Agincourt,11

I wear it for a memorable honour;,11
All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's,11

Thanks good my countryman.,11

Bring me just notice of the numbers dead,11
Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy,11

I should fight withal if he be alive.,11
An't please your majesty a rascal that swaggered,11

which he swore as he was a soldier he would wear,11
What think you Captain Fluellen? is it fit this,11
He is a craven and a villain else an't please your,11
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,11
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is as,11
your grace that he keep his vow and his oath: if,11
arrant a villain and a Jacksauce as ever his black,11
conscience la!,11
So I will my liege as I live.,11
Under Captain Gower my liege.,11
literatured in the wars.,11
I will my liege.,11
Here Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and,11
down together I plucked this glove from his helm:,11
Alencon and an enemy to our person; if thou,11
Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be,11
see the man that has but two legs that shall find,11
would fain see it once an please God of his grace,11
Knowest thou Gower?,11
Pray thee go seek him and bring him to my tent.,11
Exit,11
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:,11
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;,11
Wear it myself. Follow good cousin Warwick:,11
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,11
For I do know Fluellen valiant,11
And quickly will return an injury:,11
Go you with me uncle of Exeter.,11
SCENE VIII. Before KING HENRY'S pavilion.,11

give me; in your conscience now?,11
fellow of it.,11
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.,11
if there is any martial law in the world.,11
All offences my lord come from the heart: never,11
It was ourself thou didst abuse.,11
me but as a common man; witness the night your,11
suffered under that shape I beseech you take it for,11
took you for I made no offence; therefore I,11
Here uncle Exeter fill this glove with crowns,11
And wear it for an honour in thy cap,11
And captain you must needs be friends with him.,11

But five and twenty. O God thy arm was here;,11
Ascribe we all! When without stratagem,11
Was ever known so great and little loss,11
For it is none but thine!,11
Come go we in procession to the village.,11
To boast of this or take the praise from God,11
Is it not lawful an please your majesty to tell,11
Yes captain; but with this acknowledgement,11
Yes my conscience he did us great good.,11
Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;',11
And then to Calais; and to England then:,11

Athwart the sea. Behold the English beach,11
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,11
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,11
So swift a pace hath thought that even now,11
Where that his lords desire him to have borne,11
Before him through the city: he forbids it,11
Giving full trophy signal and ostent,11
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,11
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,11
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,11
As by a lower but loving likelihood,11
As in good time he may from Ireland coming,11
How many would the peaceful city quit,11
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;,11
Invites the King of England's stay at home;,11
To order peace between them; and omit,11

The interim by remembering you 'tis past.,11
After your thoughts straight back again to France.,11
SCENE I. France. The English camp.,11
Nay that's right; but why wear you your leek today?,11
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in,11

Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.,11
That face to face and royal eye to eye,11
If I demand before this royal view,11
Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace,11
Should not in this best garden of the world,11
Alas she hath from France too long been chased,11
Corrupting in its own fertility.,11
Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,11
Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas,11
Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts,11
The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth,11
Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank,11
But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs,11
And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges,11
Even so our houses and ourselves and children,11
The sciences that should become our country;,11
That nothing do but meditate on blood--,11
And every thing that seems unnatural.,11
You are assembled: and my speech entreats,11
Should not expel these inconveniences,11
If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace,11
Which you have cited you must buy that peace,11
Whose tenors and particular effects,11
The king hath heard them; to the which as yet,11
Well then the peace,11
I have but with a cursorary eye,11
To appoint some of your council presently,11
To re-survey them we will suddenly,11
Brother we shall. Go uncle Exeter,11
Warwick and Huntingdon go with the king;,11
Augment or alter as your wisdoms best,11
Any thing in or out of our demands,11
Go with the princes or stay here with us?,11
Haply a woman's voice may do some good,11
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:,11
Within the fore-rank of our articles.,11
Exeunt all except HENRY KATHARINE and ALICE,11
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms,11
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?,11
O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with,11
confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do,11
Pardonnez-moi I cannot tell vat is 'like me.',11
Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?,11
I said so dear Katharine; and I must not blush to,11
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de,11
What says she fair one? that the tongues of men,11
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of,11
The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,11
glad thou canst speak no better English; for if,11
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my,11
directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me,11
my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith do: and so,11
Sauf votre honneur me understand vell.,11
your sake Kate why you undid me: for the one I,11
have no strength in measure yet a reasonable,11
leap-frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my,11
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.,11
for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and,11
Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my,11
only downright oaths which I never use till urged,11
fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth,11
of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy,11
love me for this take me: if not to say to thee,11
Lord no; yet I love thee too. And while thou,11
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee,11
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue that,11
always reason themselves out again. What! a,11
good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a,11
bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax,11
moon; or rather the sun and not the moon; for it,11
course truly. If thou would have such a one take,11
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?,11
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?,11
France Kate: but in loving me you should love,11
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it,11
yours then yours is France and you are mine.,11
No Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am,11
wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook,11
vous avez le possession de moi--let me see what,11
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,11
more French: I shall never move thee in French,11
Sauf votre honneur le Francois que vous parlez il,11
No faith is't not Kate: but thy speaking of my,11
be granted to be much at one. But Kate dost thou,11
I cannot tell.,11
them. Come I know thou lovest me: and at night,11
gentlewoman about me; and I know Kate you will to,11
your heart: but good Kate mock me mercifully; the,11
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a,11
thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs,11
between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a,11
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?,11
flower-de-luce?,11
No; 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise: do,11
French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety,11
you la plus belle Katharine du monde mon tres cher,11
Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de,11
Now fie upon my false French! By mine honour in,11
dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to,11
and untempering effect of my visage. Now beshrew,11
when he got me: therefore was I created with a,11
I come to woo ladies I fright them. But in faith,11
my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of,11
hast me if thou hast me at the worst; and thou,11
and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you,11
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;,11
thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine,11
thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Harry,11
his face if he be not fellow with the best king,11
Come your answer in broken music; for thy voice is,11
all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken,11
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.,11
him Kate.,11
Upon that I kiss your hand and I call you my queen.,11
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en,11
serviteur; excusez-moi je vous supplie mon,11
Then I will kiss your lips Kate.,11
leur noces il n'est pas la coutume de France.,11
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of,11
To kiss.,11
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss,11
Oui vraiment.,11
Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak,11
manners Kate; and the liberty that follows our,11
do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your,11
and yielding.,11
You have witchcraft in your lips Kate: there is,11
tongues of the French council; and they should,11
petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.,11
God save your majesty! my royal cousin teach you,11
I would have her learn my fair cousin how,11
Is she not apt?,11
smooth; so that having neither the voice nor the,11
the spirit of love in her that he will appear in,11
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you,11
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true,11
blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the,11
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing,11
to consign to.,11
They are then excused my lord when they see not,11
Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking.,11
teach her to know my meaning: for maids well,11
Bartholomew-tide blind though they have their,11
before would not abide looking on.,11
and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the,11
As love is my lord before it loves.,11
my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city,11
Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities,11
maiden walls that war hath never entered.,11
So please you.,11
wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for,11
We have consented to all terms of reason.,11
The king hath granted every article:,11
According to their firm proposed natures.,11
Where your majesty demands that the King of France,11
shall name your highness in this form and with this,11
d'Angleterre Heritier de France; and thus in,11
Angliae et Haeres Franciae.,11
But your request shall make me let it pass.,11
Let that one article rank with the rest;,11
Take her fair son and from her blood raise up,11
Of France and England whose very shores look pale,11
May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction,11
In their sweet bosoms that never war advance,11
Amen!,11
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.,11
God the best maker of all marriages,11
As man and wife being two are one in love,11
That never may ill office or fell jealousy,11
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,11
That English may as French French Englishmen,11
Amen!,11
My Lord of Burgundy we'll take your oath,11
Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me;,11
Sennet. Exeunt,11
Enter Chorus,11
Our bending author hath pursued the story,11
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.,11
This star of England: Fortune made his sword;,11
And of it left his son imperial lord.,11
Of France and England did this king succeed;,11
That they lost France and made his England bleed:,11
In your fair minds let this acceptance take.,11
ACT I,12
I come no more to make you laugh: things now,12
Sad high and working full of state and woe,12
We now present. Those that can pity here,12
The subject will deserve it. Such as give,12
May here find truth too. Those that come to see,12
The play may pass if they be still and willing,12
Richly in two short hours. Only they,12
A noise of targets or to see a fellow,12
Will be deceived; for gentle hearers know,12
As fool and fight is beside forfeiting,12
To make that only true we now intend,12
Therefore for goodness' sake and as you are known,12
Be sad as we would make ye: think ye see,12
As they were living; think you see them great,12
Of thousand friends; then in a moment see,12
And if you can be merry then I'll say,12
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.,12
Good morrow and well met. How have ye done,12
I thank your grace,12
Of what I saw there.,12
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when,12
Met in the vale of Andren.,12
I was then present saw them salute on horseback;,12
In their embracement as they grew together;,12
Such a compounded one?,12
I was my chamber's prisoner.,12
The view of earthly glory: men might say,12
To one above itself. Each following day,12
Made former wonders its. To-day the French,12
Shone down the English; and to-morrow they,12
Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were,12
Not used to toil did almost sweat to bear,12
Was to them as a painting: now this masque,12
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,12
As presence did present them; him in eye,12
Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner,12
For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged,12
Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,12
That Bevis was believed.,12
As I belong to worship and affect,12
Would by a good discourser lose some life,12
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.,12
Distinctly his full function.,12
I mean who set the body and the limbs,12
One certes that promises no element,12
I pray you who my lord?,12
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.,12
From his ambitious finger. What had he,12
That such a keech can with his very bulk,12
And keep it from the earth.,12
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;,12
Chalks successors their way nor call'd upon,12
For eminent assistants; but spider-like,12
The force of his own merit makes his way,12
A place next to the king.,12
What heaven hath given him--let some graver eye,12
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,12
Or has given all before and he begins,12
Why the devil,12
Without the privity o' the king to appoint,12
Of all the gentry; for the most part such,12
He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,12
Must fetch him in the papers.,12
Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have,12
They shall abound as formerly.,12
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em,12
But minister communication of,12
Grievingly I think,12
The cost that did conclude it.,12
After the hideous storm that follow'd was,12
Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,12
The sudden breach on't.,12
For France hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd,12
Is it therefore,12
Marry is't.,12
At a superfluous rate!,12
Our reverend cardinal carried.,12
The state takes notice of the private difference,12
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you,12
The cardinal's malice and his potency,12
What his high hatred would effect wants not,12
That he's revengeful and I know his sword,12
It reaches far and where 'twill not extend,12
You'll find it wholesome. Lo where comes that rock,12
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY the purse borne before him  certain of the Guard and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM and BUCKINGHAM on him both full of disdain,12
Where's his examination?,12
Is he in person ready?,12
Well we shall then know more; and Buckingham,12
Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train,12
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best,12
Outworths a noble's blood.,12
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only,12
I read in's looks,12
Me as his abject object: at this instant,12
I'll follow and outstare him.,12
And let your reason with your choler question,12
Requires slow pace at first: anger is like,12
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England,12
As you would to your friend.,12
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down,12
There's difference in no persons.,12
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot,12
By violent swiftness that which we run at,12
The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,12
I say again there is no English soul,12
If with the sap of reason you would quench,12
Sir,12
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,12
From sincere motions by intelligence,12
We see each grain of gravel I do know,12
Say not 'treasonous.',12
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,12
As he is subtle and as prone to mischief,12
Infecting one another yea reciprocally--,12
As here at home suggests the king our master,12
That swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass,12
Faith and so it did.,12
The articles o' the combination drew,12
As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end,12
Has done this and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,12
Which as I take it is a kind of puppy,12
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--,12
To whisper Wolsey--here makes visitation:,12
England and France might through their amity,12
Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily,12
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor,12
Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,12
That he would please to alter the king's course,12
As soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal,12
And for his own advantage.,12
To hear this of him; and could wish he were,12
No not a syllable:,12
He shall appear in proof.,12
Your office sergeant; execute it.,12
My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl,12
Arrest thee of high treason in the name,12
Lo you my lord,12
Under device and practise.,12
To see you ta'en from liberty to look on,12
You shall to the Tower.,12
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me,12
Be done in this and all things! I obey.,12
Nay he must bear you company. The king,12
Is pleased you shall to the Tower till you know,12
As the duke said,12
By me obey'd!,12
The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies,12
One Gilbert Peck his chancellor--,12
These are the limbs o' the plot: no more I hope.,12
O Nicholas Hopkins?,12
My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal,12
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,12
By darkening my clear sun. My lord farewell.,12
SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.,12
My life itself and the best heart of it,12
Of a full-charged confederacy and give thanks,12
That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person,12
And point by point the treasons of his master,12
A noise within crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE ushered by NORFOLK and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state takes her up kisses and placeth her by him,12
Arise and take place by us: half your suit,12
The other moiety ere you ask is given;,12
Thank your majesty.,12
Not unconsider'd leave your honour nor,12
Of my petition.,12
I am solicited not by a few,12
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions,12
Of all their loyalties: wherein although,12
Most bitterly on you as putter on,12
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he,12
Language unmannerly yea such which breaks,12
In loud rebellion.,12
It doth appear; for upon these taxations,12
The many to them longing have put off,12
Unfit for other life compell'd by hunger,12
Daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar,12
Taxation!,12
You that are blamed for it alike with us,12
Please you sir,12
Pertains to the state; and front but in that file,12
No my lord,12
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome,12
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,12
Most pestilent to the bearing; and to bear 'em,12
They are devised by you; or else you suffer,12
Still exaction!,12
Is this exaction?,12
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd,12
Comes through commissions which compel from each,12
Without delay; and the pretence for this,12
Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze,12
Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,12
To each incensed will. I would your highness,12
There is no primer business.,12
This is against our pleasure.,12
I have no further gone in this than by,12
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am,12
My faculties nor person yet will be,12
Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake,12
Our necessary actions in the fear,12
As ravenous fishes do a vessel follow,12
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,12
Not ours or not allow'd; what worst as oft,12
For our best act. If we shall stand still,12
We should take root here where we sit or sit,12
Things done well,12
Things done without example in their issue,12
Of this commission? I believe not any.,12
And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?,12
From every tree lop bark and part o' the timber;,12
The air will drink the sap. To every county,12
Free pardon to each man that has denied,12
I put it to your care.,12
To the Secretary,12
Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons,12
That through our intercession this revokement,12
Further in the proceeding.,12
Enter Surveyor,12
Is run in your displeasure.,12
The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;,12
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,12
When these so noble benefits shall prove,12
They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly,12
Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders and when we,12
His hour of speech a minute; he my lady,12
That once were his and is become as black,12
This was his gentleman in trust--of him,12
The fore-recited practises; whereof,12
Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you,12
Out of the Duke of Buckingham.,12
First it was usual with him every day,12
Should without issue die he'll carry it so,12
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,12
Revenge upon the cardinal.,12
This dangerous conception in this point.,12
His will is most malignant; and it stretches,12
My learn'd lord cardinal,12
Speak on:,12
Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him,12
He was brought to this,12
What was that Hopkins?,12
His confessor who fed him every minute,12
How know'st thou this?,12
The duke being at the Rose within the parish,12
What was the speech among the Londoners,12
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,12
Said 'twas the fear indeed; and that he doubted,12
Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft' says he,12
John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour,12
Whom after under the confession's seal,12
My chaplain to no creature living but,12
This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,12
To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke,12
If I know you well,12
On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed,12
And spoil your nobler soul: I say take heed;,12
Let him on.,12
On my soul I'll speak but truth.,12
The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him,12
It forged him some design which being believed,12
It can do me no damage;' adding further,12
The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads,12
Ha! what so rank? Ah ha!,12
I can my liege.,12
Being at Greenwich,12
About Sir William Blomer--,12
Of such a time: being my sworn servant,12
If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed,12
The part my father meant to act upon,12
Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,12
Have put his knife to him.',12
Now madam may his highness live in freedom,12
God mend all!,12
After 'the duke his father' with 'the knife',12
Another spread on's breast mounting his eyes,12
Was--were he evil used he would outgo,12
Does an irresolute purpose.,12
To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;,12
Find mercy in the law 'tis his: if none,12
He's traitor to the height.,12
SCENE III. An ante-chamber in the palace.,12
Is't possible the spells of France should juggle,12
New customs,12
Nay let 'em be unmanly yet are follow'd.,12
Have got by the late voyage is but merely,12
For when they hold 'em you would swear directly,12
To Pepin or Clotharius they keep state so.,12
That never saw 'em pace before the spavin,12
Death! my lord,12
That sure they've worn out Christendom.,12
How now!,12
Faith my lord,12
That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.,12
The reformation of our travell'd gallants,12
I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs,12
And never see the Louvre.,12
For so run the conditions leave those remnants,12
With all their honourable point of ignorance,12
Abusing better men than they can be,12
The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,12
And understand again like honest men;,12
They may 'cum privilegio' wear away,12
Tis time to give 'em physic their diseases,12
What a loss our ladies,12
Ay marry,12
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;,12
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,12
An honest country lord as I am beaten,12
And have an hour of hearing; and by'r lady,12
Well said Lord Sands;,12
No my lord;,12
Sir Thomas,12
To the cardinal's:,12
O 'tis true:,12
To many lords and ladies; there will be,12
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,12
His dews fall every where.,12
He had a black mouth that said other of him.,12
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:,12
They are set here for examples.,12
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;,12
We shall be late else; which I would not be,12
This night to be comptrollers.,12
Exeunt,12
Hautboys. A small table under a state for CARDINAL  WOLSEY a longer table for the guests. Then enter  ANNE and divers other Ladies and Gentlemen as  guests at one door; at another door enter GUILDFORD,12
Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates,12
In all this noble bevy has brought with her,12
As first good company good wine good welcome,12
Enter Chamberlain SANDS and LOVELL,12
Clapp'd wings to me.,12
Sir Thomas Lovell had the cardinal,12
Should find a running banquet ere they rested,12
They are a sweet society of fair ones.,12
To one or two of these!,12
They should find easy penance.,12
As easy as a down-bed would afford it.,12
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:,12
Two women placed together makes cold weather:,12
Pray sit between these ladies.,12
And thank your lordship. By your leave sweet ladies:,12
I had it from my father.,12
O very mad exceeding mad in love too:,12
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.,12
Well said my lord.,12
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies,12
For my little cure,12
Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and takes his state,12
Or gentleman that is not freely merry,12
And to you all good health.,12
Your grace is noble:,12
And save me so much talking.,12
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.,12
Whose fault is this?,12
In their fair cheeks my lord; then we shall have 'em,12
You are a merry gamester,12
Yes if I make my play.,12
For 'tis to such a thing--,12
I told your grace they would talk anon.,12
What's that?,12
Exit Servant,12
And to what end is this? Nay ladies fear not;,12
Re-enter Servant,12
A noble troop of strangers;,12
And hither make as great ambassadors,12
Good lord chamberlain,12
And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em,12
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.,12
You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.,12
I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.,12
A noble company! what are their pleasures?,12
To tell your grace that having heard by fame,12
This night to meet here they could do no less,12
But leave their flocks; and under your fair conduct,12
An hour of revels with 'em.,12
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em,12
They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII chooses ANNE,12
Till now I never knew thee!,12
My lord!,12
Pray tell 'em thus much from me:,12
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,12
I would surrender it.,12
Whispers the Masquers,12
Such a one they all confess,12
Find out and he will take it.,12
By all your good leaves gentlemen; here I'll make,12
Ye have found him cardinal:,12
You hold a fair assembly; you do well lord:,12
I should judge now unhappily.,12
Your grace is grown so pleasant.,12
Prithee come hither: what fair lady's that?,12
The Viscount Rochford--one of her highness' women.,12

Let it go round.,12

In the next chamber.,12

Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.,12
Urged on the examinations proofs confessions,12
To have brought viva voce to his face:,12
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,12
Hopkins that made this mischief.,12
That fed him with his prophecies?,12
All these accused him strongly; which he fain,12
And so his peers upon this evidence,12
He spoke and learnedly for life; but all,12
After all this how did he bear himself?,12
His knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd,12
And something spoke in choler ill and hasty:,12
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.,12
Sure he does not:,12
He may a little grieve at.,12
The cardinal is the end of this.,12
By all conjectures: first Kildare's attainder,12
Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too,12
That trick of state,12
At his return,12
And generally whoever the king favours,12
And far enough from court too.,12
Hate him perniciously and o' my conscience,12
They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,12
Stay there sir,12
Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves  before him; the axe with the edge towards him;  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL VAUX SANDS and common people,12
All good people,12
Hear what I say and then go home and lose me.,12
And by that name must die: yet heaven bear witness,12
Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful!,12
T has done upon the premises but justice:,12
Be what they will I heartily forgive 'em:,12
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;,12
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,12
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,12
His noble friends and fellows whom to leave,12
Go with me like good angels to my end;,12
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,12
I do beseech your grace for charity,12
Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly.,12
As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;,12
Gainst me that I cannot take peace with:,12
Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;,12
You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers,12
Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live,12
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!,12
Goodness and he fill up one monument!,12
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,12
Prepare there,12
And fit it with such furniture as suits,12
Nay Sir Nicholas,12
When I came hither I was lord high constable,12
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,12
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.,12
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,12
Being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd,12
Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying,12
Restored me to my honours and out of ruins,12
Henry the Eighth life honour name and all,12
For ever from the world. I had my trial,12
A little happier than my wretched father:,12
Fell by our servants by those men we loved most;,12
Heaven has an end in all: yet you that hear me,12
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,12
And give your hearts to when they once perceive,12
Like water from ye never found again,12
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour,12
And when you would say something that is sad,12
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train,12
I fear too many curses on their beads,12
If the duke be guiltless,12
Of an ensuing evil if it fall,12
Good angels keep it from us!,12
This secret is so weighty 'twill require,12
Let me have it;,12
I am confident,12
A buzzing of a separation,12
Yes but it held not:,12
He sent command to the lord mayor straight,12
That durst disperse it.,12
Is found a truth now: for it grows again,12
The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,12
To the good queen possess'd him with a scruple,12
Cardinal Campeius is arrived and lately;,12
Tis the cardinal;,12
For not bestowing on him at his asking,12
I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel,12
Will have his will and she must fall.,12
We are too open here to argue this;,12
Exeunt,12
Enter Chamberlain reading a letter,12
all the care I had I saw well chosen ridden and,12
best breed in the north. When they were ready to,12
commission and main power took 'em from me; with,12
subject if not before the king; which stopped our,12
I fear he will indeed: well let him have them:,12
Enter to Chamberlain NORFOLK and SUFFOLK,12
Good day to both your graces.,12
I left him private,12
What's the cause?,12
Has crept too near his conscience.,12
Has crept too near another lady.,12
This is the cardinal's doing the king-cardinal:,12
Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.,12
How holily he works in all his business!,12
Between us and the emperor the queen's great nephew,12
Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience,12
And out of all these to restore the king,12
That like a jewel has hung twenty years,12
Of her that loves him with that excellence,12
That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,12
Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true,12
And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare,12
The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open,12
This bold bad man.,12
We had need pray,12
Or this imperious man will work us all,12
Lie like one lump before him to be fashion'd,12
For me my lords,12
As I am made without him so I'll stand,12
Touch me alike they're breath I not believe in.,12
To him that made him proud the pope.,12
And with some other business put the king,12
My lord you'll bear us company?,12
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,12
Health to your lordships.,12
Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain and sits reading pensively,12
Who's there ha?,12
Who's there I say? How dare you thrust yourselves,12
Who am I? ha?,12
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way,12
To know your royal pleasure.,12
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:,12
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS with a commission,12
The quiet of my wounded conscience;,12
To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,12
Most learned reverend sir into our kingdom:,12
To CARDINAL WOLSEY,12
I be not found a talker.,12
I would your grace would give us but an hour,12
[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK],12
[Aside to SUFFOLK],12
[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:,12
But this cannot continue.,12
I'll venture one have-at-him.,12
Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK,12
Above all princes in committing freely,12
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?,12
Must now confess if they have any goodness,12
I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms,12
Invited by your noble self hath sent,12
This just and learned priest Cardinal Campeius;,12
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,12
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.,12
You are so noble. To your highness' hand,12
The court of Rome commanding you my lord,12
In the unpartial judging of this business.,12
Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?,12
So dear in heart not to deny her that,12
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.,12
To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,12
I find him a fit fellow.,12
Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY with GARDINER,12
favour to you;,12
[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY],12
For ever by your grace whose hand has raised me.,12
Walks and whispers,12
In this man's place before him?,12
Was he not held a learned man?,12
Believe me there's an ill opinion spread then,12
How! of me?,12
And fearing he would rise he was so virtuous,12
That he ran mad and died.,12
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers,12
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,12
I will have none so near else. Learn this brother,12
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.,12
The most convenient place that I can think of,12
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.,12
Would it not grieve an able man to leave,12
O 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.,12
SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.,12
Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:,12
So good a lady that no tongue could ever,12
She never knew harm-doing: O now after,12
Still growing in a majesty and pomp the which,12
Tis sweet at first to acquire--after this process,12
Would move a monster.,12
Melt and lament for her.,12
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,12
It from the bearer 'tis a sufferance panging,12
Alas poor lady!,12
So much the more,12
I swear 'tis better to be lowly born,12
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,12
Our content,12
By my troth and maidenhead,12
Beshrew me I would,12
For all this spice of your hypocrisy:,12
Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet,12
Which to say sooth are blessings; and which gifts,12
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,12
Nay good troth.,12
No not for all the riches under heaven.,12
Old as I am to queen it: but I pray you,12
To bear that load of title?,12
Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;,12
For more than blushing comes to: if your back,12
Ever to get a boy.,12
I swear again I would not be a queen,12
In faith for little England,12
Would for Carnarvonshire although there long'd,12
Enter Chamberlain,12
The secret of your conference?,12
Not your demand; it values not your asking:,12
It was a gentle business and becoming,12
All will be well.,12
You bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings,12
Perceive I speak sincerely and high note's,12
Commends his good opinion of you and,12
Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title,12
Out of his grace he adds.,12
What kind of my obedience I should tender;,12
Are not words duly hallow'd nor my wishes,12
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,12
As from a blushing handmaid to his highness;,12
Lady,12
The king hath of you.,12
I have perused her well;,12
That they have caught the king: and who knows yet,12
To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,12
Exit Chamberlain,12
Why this it is; see see!,12
Am yet a courtier beggarly nor could,12
For any suit of pounds; and you O fate!,12
This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up,12
This is strange to me.,12
There was a lady once 'tis an old story,12
For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?,12
With your theme I could,12
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!,12
That promises moe thousands: honour's train,12
I know your back will bear a duchess: say,12
Good lady,12
And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,12
To think what follows.,12
In our long absence: pray do not deliver,12
What do you think me?,12
SCENE IV. A hall in Black-Friars.,12
Whilst our commission from Rome is read,12
What's the need?,12
And on all sides the authority allow'd;,12
Be't so. Proceed.,12
Henry King of England  and c.,12
Say Katharine Queen of England come into the court.,12
QUEEN KATHARINE makes no answer rises out of her  chair goes about the court comes to KING HENRY VIII and kneels at his feet; then speaks,12
And to bestow your pity on me: for,12
Born out of your dominions; having here,12
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas sir,12
Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,12
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,12
At all times to your will conformable;,12
Yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry,12
I ever contradicted your desire,12
Have I not strove to love although I knew,12
That had to him derived your anger did I,12
He was from thence discharged. Sir call to mind,12
Upward of twenty years and have been blest,12
And process of this time you can report,12
My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,12
Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt,12
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,12
A prince most prudent of an excellent,12
My father king of Spain was reckon'd one,12
A year before: it is not to be question'd,12
Of every realm that did debate this business,12
Beseech you sir to spare me till I may,12
I will implore: if not i' the name of God,12
You have here lady,12
Of singular integrity and learning,12
To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless,12
For your own quiet as to rectify,12
His grace,12
It's fit this royal session do proceed;,12
Be now produced and heard.,12
To you I speak.,12
Sir,12
We are a queen or long have dream'd so certain,12
I'll turn to sparks of fire.,12
I will when you are humble; nay before,12
Induced by potent circumstances that,12
You shall not be my judge: for it is you,12
Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,12
Refuse you for my judge; whom yet once more,12
At all a friend to truth.,12
You speak not like yourself; who ever yet,12
Of disposition gentle and of wisdom,12
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice,12
Or how far further shall is warranted,12
Yea the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me,12
The king is present: if it be known to him,12
And worthily my falsehood! yea as much,12
That I am free of your report he knows,12
It lies to cure me: and the cure is to,12
His highness shall speak in I do beseech,12
And to say so no more.,12
I am a simple woman much too weak,12
humble-mouth'd;,12
With meekness and humility; but your heart,12
You have by fortune and his highness' favours,12
Where powers are your retainers and your words,12
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,12
Your high profession spiritual: that again,12
Before you all appeal unto the pope,12
And to be judged by him.,12
The queen is obstinate,12
Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.,12
Call her again.,12
Madam you are call'd back.,12
When you are call'd return. Now the Lord help,12
I will not tarry; no nor ever more,12
In any of their courts.,12
Go thy ways Kate:,12
A better wife let him in nought be trusted,12
If thy rare qualities sweet gentleness,12
Obeying in commanding and thy parts,12
The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;,12
Carried herself towards me.,12
In humblest manner I require your highness,12
Of all these ears--for where I am robb'd and bound,12
At once and fully satisfied--whether ever I,12
Laid any scruple in your way which might,12
Have to you but with thanks to God for such,12
Be to the prejudice of her present state,12
My lord cardinal,12
I free you from't. You are not to be taught,12
Why they are so but like to village-curs,12
The queen is put in anger. You're excused:,12
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired,12
The passages made toward it: on my honour,12
And thus far clear him. Now what moved me to't,12
Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:,12
Scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd,12
Who had been hither sent on the debating,12
Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,12
I mean the bishop did require a respite;,12
Whether our daughter were legitimate,12
Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook,12
Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble,12
That many mazed considerings did throng,12
I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had,12
If it conceived a male child by me should,12
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue,12
This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,12
Well worthy the best heir o' the world should not,12
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in,12
Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in,12
Toward this remedy whereupon we are,12
I meant to rectify my conscience--which,12
By all the reverend fathers of the land,12
With you my Lord of Lincoln; you remember,12
When I first moved you.,12
I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say,12
So please your highness,12
Bearing a state of mighty moment in't,12
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;,12
Which you are running here.,12
My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave,12
I left no reverend person in this court;,12
Under your hands and seals: therefore go on:,12
Of the good queen but the sharp thorny points,12
Prove but our marriage lawful by my life,12
To wear our mortal state to come with her,12
That's paragon'd o' the world.,12
The queen being absent 'tis a needful fitness,12
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion,12
She intends unto his holiness.,12
These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor,12
My learn'd and well-beloved servant Cranmer,12
My comfort comes along. Break up the court:,12
Exeunt in manner as they entered,12
SCENE I. London. QUEEN KATHARINE's apartments.,12
Take thy lute wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;,12
SONG,12
And the mountain tops that freeze,12
To his music plants and flowers,12
There had made a lasting spring.,12
Even the billows of the sea,12
In sweet music is such art,12
Fall asleep or hearing die.,12
How now!,12
Wait in the presence.,12
They will'd me say so madam.,12
To come near.,12
What can be their business,12
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,12
But all hoods make not monks.,12
Peace to your highness!,12
I would be all against the worst may happen.,12
May it please you noble madam to withdraw,12
The full cause of our coming.,12
There's nothing I have done yet o' my conscience,12
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!,12
Above a number if my actions,12
Envy and base opinion set against 'em,12
Seek me out and that way I am wife in,12
Tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina,12
O good my lord no Latin;,12
As not to know the language I have lived in:,12
suspicious;,12
If you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake;,12
The willing'st sin I ever yet committed,12
Noble lady,12
And service to his majesty and you,12
We come not by the way of accusation,12
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,12
How you stand minded in the weighty difference,12
Like free and honest men our just opinions,12
Most honour'd madam,12
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,12
Both of his truth and him which was too far,12
His service and his counsel.,12
My lords I thank you both for your good wills;,12
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,12
More near my life I fear--with my weak wit,12
In truth I know not. I was set at work,12
Either for such men or such business.,12
The last fit of my greatness--good your graces,12
Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless!,12
Your hopes and friends are infinite.,12
But little for my profit: can you think lords,12
Or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure,12
And live a subject? Nay forsooth my friends,12
They that my trust must grow to live not here:,12
In mine own country lords.,12
Would leave your griefs and take my counsel.,12
Put your main cause into the king's protection;,12
Both for your honour better and your cause;,12
You'll part away disgraced.,12
Ye tell me what ye wish for both--my ruin:,12
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge,12
Your rage mistakes us.,12
Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues;,12
Mend 'em for shame my lords. Is this your comfort?,12
A woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd?,12
I have more charity: but say I warn'd ye;,12
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.,12
You turn the good we offer into envy.,12
And all such false professors! would you have me--,12
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--,12
Alas has banish'd me his bed already,12
And all the fellowship I hold now with him,12
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies,12
Your fears are worse.,12
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife a true one?,12
Never yet branded with suspicion?,12
Still met the king? loved him next heaven?,12
Been out of fondness superstitious to him?,12
And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well lords.,12
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;,12
Yet will I add an honour a great patience.,12
My lord I dare not make myself so guilty,12
Your master wed me to: nothing but death,12
Pray hear me.,12
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!,12
What will become of me now wretched lady!,12
Alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes!,12
No friend no hope; no kindred weep for me;,12
That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,12
If your grace,12
You'ld feel more comfort: why should we good lady,12
The way of our profession is against it:,12
For goodness' sake consider what you do;,12
Grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage.,12
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits,12
I know you have a gentle noble temper,12
Those we profess peace-makers friends and servants.,12
With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,12
Such doubts as false coin from it. The king loves you;,12
To trust us in your business we are ready,12
Do what ye will my lords: and pray forgive me,12
You know I am a woman lacking wit,12
Pray do my service to his majesty:,12
While I shall have my life. Come reverend fathers,12
That little thought when she set footing here,12
Exeunt,12
Enter NORFOLK SUFFOLK SURREY and Chamberlain,12
And force them with a constancy the cardinal,12
The offer of this time I cannot promise,12
With these you bear already.,12
To meet the least occasion that may give me,12
To be revenged on him.,12
Have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least,12
The stamp of nobleness in any person,12
My lords you speak your pleasures:,12
What we can do to him though now the time,12
Bar his access to the king never attempt,12
Over the king in's tongue.,12
His spell in that is out: the king hath found,12
The honey of his language. No he's settled,12
Sir,12
Once every hour.,12
In the divorce his contrary proceedings,12
As I would wish mine enemy.,12
His practises to light?,12
O how how?,12
And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,12
To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if,12
My king is tangled in affection to,12
Has the king this?,12
Will this work?,12
And hedges his own way. But in this point,12
After his patient's death: the king already,12
Would he had!,12
For I profess you have it.,12
Trace the conjunction!,12
All men's!,12
Marry this is yet but young and may be left,12
She is a gallant creature and complete,12
Will fall some blessing to this land which shall,12
But will the king,12
The Lord forbid!,12
No no;,12
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius,12
Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and,12
To second all his plot. I do assure you,12
Now God incense him,12
But my lord,12
He is return'd in his opinions; which,12
Together with all famous colleges,12
His second marriage shall be publish'd and,12
Shall be call'd queen but princess dowager,12
This same Cranmer's,12
In the king's business.,12
For it an archbishop.,12
Tis so.,12
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL,12
The packet Cromwell.,12
To his own hand in's bedchamber.,12
Presently,12
He did it with a serious mind; a heed,12
Attend him here this morning.,12
To come abroad?,12
Leave me awhile.,12
Aside,12
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.,12
There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!,12
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!,12
May be he hears the king,12
Sharp enough,12
[Aside]  The late queen's gentlewoman,12
To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!,12
Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous,12
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to,12
Our hard-ruled king. Again there is sprung up,12
Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,12
He is vex'd at something.,12
The master-cord on's heart!,12
The king the king!,12
To his own portion! and what expense by the hour,12
Does he rake this together! Now my lords,12
My lord we have,12
Is in his brain: he bites his lip and starts;,12
Then lays his finger on his temple straight,12
Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts,12
We have seen him set himself.,12
There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning,12
As I required: and wot you what I found,12
Forsooth an inventory thus importing;,12
Rich stuffs and ornaments of household; which,12
Possession of a subject.,12
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,12
If we did think,12
And fix'd on spiritual object he should still,12
His thinkings are below the moon not worth,12
King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY,12
Ever God bless your highness!,12
You are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory,12
You were now running o'er: you have scarce time,12
To keep your earthly audit: sure in that,12
To have you therein my companion.,12
For holy offices I have a time; a time,12
I bear i' the state; and nature does require,12
I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal,12
You have said well.,12
As I will lend you cause my doing well,12
Tis well said again;,12
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:,12
His word upon you. Since I had my office,12
Employ'd you where high profits might come home,12
My bounties upon you.,12
[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!,12
The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me,12
And if you may confess it say withal,12
My sovereign I confess your royal graces,12
My studied purposes requite; which went,12
Have ever come too short of my desires,12
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed,12
The profit of the state. For your great graces,12
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,12
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,12
Fairly answer'd;,12
Therein illustrated: the honour of it,12
The foulness is the punishment. I presume,12
My heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more,12
Your brain and every function of your power,12
As 'twere in love's particular be more,12
I do profess,12
More than mine own; that am have and will be--,12
And throw it from their soul; though perils did,12
Appear in forms more horrid--yet my duty,12
Should the approach of this wild river break,12
Tis nobly spoken:,12
For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;,12
And after this: and then to breakfast with,12
Exit KING HENRY VIII frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles throng after him smiling and whispering,12
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?,12
Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion,12
Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;,12
This paper has undone me: 'tis the account,12
For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,12
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil,12
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?,12
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know,12
Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!',12
I writ to's holiness. Nay then farewell!,12
And from that full meridian of my glory,12
Like a bright exhalation m the evening,12
Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY NORFOLK and SUFFOLK SURREY and the Chamberlain,12
To render up the great seal presently,12
To Asher House my Lord of Winchester's,12
Stay:,12
Authority so weighty.,12
Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?,12
I mean your malice know officious lords,12
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy:,12
As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton,12
Follow your envious courses men of malice;,12
In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,12
Mine and your master with his own hand gave me;,12
During my life; and to confirm his goodness,12
The king that gave it.,12
Thou art a proud traitor priest.,12
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better,12
Thy ambition,12
Of noble Buckingham my father-in-law:,12
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,12
You sent me deputy for Ireland;,12
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;,12
Absolved him with an axe.,12
This talking lord can lay upon my credit,12
Found his deserts: how innocent I was,12
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.,12
You have as little honesty as honour,12
Toward the king my ever royal master,12
And all that love his follies.,12
Your long coat priest protects you; thou,12
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,12
And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,12
Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,12
All goodness,12
Yes that goodness,12
Into your own hands cardinal by extortion;,12
You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,12
My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble,12
Of our despised nobility our issues,12
Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles,12
Worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench,12
How much methinks I could despise this man,12
Those articles my lord are in the king's hand:,12
So much fairer,12
When the king knows my truth.,12
I thank my memory I yet remember,12
Now if you can blush and cry 'guilty' cardinal,12
Speak on sir;,12
It is to see a nobleman want manners.,12
First that without the king's assent or knowledge,12
You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.,12
To foreign princes 'Ego et Rex meus',12
To be your servant.,12
Either of king or council when you went,12
To carry into Flanders the great seal.,12
To Gregory de Cassado to conclude,12
A league between his highness and Ferrara.,12
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.,12
By what means got I leave to your own conscience--,12
You have for dignities; to the mere undoing,12
Which since they are of you and odious,12
O my lord,12
His faults lie open to the laws; let them,12
So little of his great self.,12
Lord cardinal the king's further pleasure is,12
By your power legatine within this kingdom,12
That therefore such a writ be sued against you;,12
Chattels and whatsoever and to be,12
And so we'll leave you to your meditations,12
About the giving back the great seal to us,12
So fare you well my little good lord cardinal.,12
So farewell to the little good you bear me.,12
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth,12
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;,12
And when he thinks good easy man full surely,12
And then he falls as I do. I have ventured,12
This many summers in a sea of glory,12
At length broke under me and now has left me,12
Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.,12
I feel my heart new open'd. O how wretched,12
There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,12
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:,12
Never to hope again.,12
Why how now Cromwell!,12
What amazed,12
A great man should decline? Nay an you weep,12
How does your grace?,12
Never so truly happy my good Cromwell.,12
A peace above all earthly dignities,12
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,12
A load would sink a navy too much honour:,12
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!,12
I hope I have: I am able now methinks,12
To endure more miseries and greater far,12
What news abroad?,12
Is your displeasure with the king.,12
The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen,12
That's somewhat sudden:,12
Long in his highness' favour and do justice,12
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,12
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,12
That's news indeed.,12
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,12
Going to chapel; and the voice is now,12
There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,12
In that one woman I have lost for ever:,12
Or gild again the noble troops that waited,12
I am a poor fall'n man unworthy now,12
That sun I pray may never set! I have told him,12
Some little memory of me will stir him--,12
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,12
For thine own future safety.,12
Must I then leave you? must I needs forego,12
Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron,12
The king shall have my service: but my prayers,12
Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear,12
Out of thy honest truth to play the woman.,12
And when I am forgotten as I shall be,12
Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee,12
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,12
A sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it.,12
Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition:,12
The image of his Maker hope to win by it?,12
Corruption wins not more than honesty.,12
To silence envious tongues. Be just and fear not:,12
Thy God's and truth's; then if thou fall'st,12
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;,12
There take an inventory of all I have,12
And my integrity to heaven is all,12
Had I but served my God with half the zeal,12
Have left me naked to mine enemies.,12
So I have. Farewell,12
Exeunt,12
SCENE I. A street in Westminster.,12
You're well met once again.,12
You come to take your stand here and behold,12
Tis all my business. At our last encounter,12
Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;,12
Tis well: the citizens,12
As let 'em have their rights they are ever forward--,12
Pageants and sights of honour.,12
Nor I'll assure you better taken sir.,12
That paper in your hand?,12
Of those that claim their offices this day,12
The Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims,12
He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.,12
I should have been beholding to your paper.,12
The princess dowager? how goes her business?,12
Of Canterbury accompanied with other,12
Held a late court at Dunstable six miles off,12
She was often cited by them but appear'd not:,12
The king's late scruple by the main assent,12
And the late marriage made of none effect,12
Where she remains now sick.,12
Trumpets,12
Hautboys,12
1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.,12
3. Lord Chancellor with the purse and mace,12
4. Choristers singing.,12
5. Mayor of London bearing the mace. Then,12
head a gilt copper crown.,12
on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With,12
the dove crowned with an earl's coronet.,12
7. SUFFOLK in his robe of estate his coronet,12
high-steward. With him NORFOLK with the,12
Collars of SS.,12
under it QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair,12
side her the Bishops of London and,12
9. The old Duchess of Norfolk in a coronal of,12
ANNE's train.,12
circlets of gold without flowers.,12
A royal train believe me. These I know:,12
Marquess Dorset:,12
A bold brave gentleman. That should be,12
Tis the same: high-steward.,12
Yes;,12
Looking on QUEEN ANNE,12
Sir as I have a soul she is an angel;,12
And more and richer when he strains that lady:,12
They that bear,12
Of the Cinque-ports.,12
I take it she that carries up the train,12
It is; and all the rest are countesses.,12
And sometimes falling ones.,12
Exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets,12
God save you sir! where have you been broiling?,12
Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled,12
You saw,12
That I did.,12
Well worth the seeing.,12
As well as I am able. The rich stream,12
To a prepared place in the choir fell off,12
To rest awhile some half an hour or so,12
The beauty of her person to the people.,12
That ever lay by man: which when the people,12
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,12
Doublets I think--flew up; and had their faces,12
I never saw before. Great-bellied women,12
In the old time of war would shake the press,12
Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven,12
But what follow'd?,12
Came to the altar; where she kneel'd and saint-like,12
Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:,12
She had all the royal makings of a queen;,12
The rod and bird of peace and all such emblems,12
With all the choicest music of the kingdom,12
And with the same full state paced back again,12
Sir,12
For since the cardinal fell that title's lost:,12
I know it;,12
Is fresh about me.,12
Were those that went on each side of the queen?,12
Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,12
He of Winchester,12
The virtuous Cranmer.,12
However yet there is no great breach; when it comes,12
Who may that be I pray you?,12
A man in much esteem with the king and truly,12
O' the jewel house,12
He will deserve more.,12
Come gentlemen ye shall go my way which,12
Something I can command. As I walk thither,12
You may command us sir.,12
SCENE II. Kimbolton.,12
How does your grace?,12
My legs like loaden branches bow to the earth,12
So; now methinks I feel a little ease.,12
That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey Was dead?,12
Out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't.,12
If well he stepp'd before me happily,12
Well the voice goes madam:,12
Arrested him at York and brought him forward,12
He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill,12
Alas poor man!,12
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,12
To whom he gave these words 'O father abbot,12
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;,12
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness,12
About the hour of eight which he himself,12
Continual meditations tears and sorrows,12
His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace.,12
Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him,12
Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking,12
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;,12
He would say untruths; and be ever double,12
But where he meant to ruin pitiful:,12
But his performance as he is now nothing:,12
The clergy in example.,12
Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues,12
To hear me speak his good now?,12
I were malicious else.,12
Though from an humble stock undoubtedly,12
He was a scholar and a ripe and good one;,12
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;,12
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,12
He was most princely: ever witness for him,12
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,12
The other though unfinish'd yet so famous,12
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.,12
For then and not till then he felt himself,12
And to add greater honours to his age,12
After my death I wish no other herald,12
To keep mine honour from corruption,12
Whom I most hated living thou hast made me,12
Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!,12
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,12
I named my knell whilst I sit meditating,12
Sad and solemn music,12
For fear we wake her: softly gentle Patience.,12
Spirits of peace where are ye? are ye all gone,12
Madam we are here.,12
Saw ye none enter since I slept?,12
No? Saw you not even now a blessed troop,12
Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun?,12
And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel,12
I am most joyful madam such good dreams,12
Bid the music leave,12
Music ceases,12
How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?,12
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!,12
Heaven comfort her!,12
An't like your grace--,12
Deserve we no more reverence?,12
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,12
I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;,12
A gentleman sent from the king to see you.,12
Let me ne'er see again.,12
Re-enter GRIFFITH with CAPUCIUS,12
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,12
Madam the same; your servant.,12
The times and titles now are alter'd strangely,12
What is your pleasure with me?,12
First mine own service to your grace; the next,12
Who grieves much for your weakness and by me,12
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.,12
Tis like a pardon after execution:,12
But now I am past an comforts here but prayers.,12
Madam in good health.,12
When I shal l dwell with worms and my poor name,12
I caused you write yet sent away?,12
Giving it to KATHARINE,12
This to my lord the king.,12
In which I have commended to his goodness,12
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!,12
She is young and of a noble modest nature,12
To love her for her mother's sake that loved him,12
Is that his noble grace would have some pity,12
Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:,12
And now I should not lie but will deserve,12
For honesty and decent carriage,12
And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.,12
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;,12
And something over to remember me by:,12
And able means we had not parted thus.,12
By that you love the dearest in this world,12
Stand these poor people's friend and urge the king,12
By heaven I will,12
I thank you honest lord. Remember me,12
Say his long trouble now is passing,12
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,12
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;,12
Let me be used with honour: strew me over,12
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,12
A queen and daughter to a king inter me.,12
Exeunt leading KATHARINE,12
SCENE I. London. A gallery in the palace.,12
It's one o'clock boy is't not?,12
These should be hours for necessities,12
With comforting repose and not for us,12
Whither so late?,12
I did Sir Thomas: and left him at primero,12
I must to him too,12
Not yet Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?,12
No great offence belongs to't give your friend,12
As they say spirits do at midnight have,12
That seeks dispatch by day.,12
And durst commend a secret to your ear,12
They say in great extremity; and fear'd,12
The fruit she goes with,12
Good time and live: but for the stock Sir Thomas,12
Methinks I could,12
She's a good creature and sweet lady does,12
But sir sir,12
Of mine own way; I know you wise religious;,12
Twill not Sir Thomas Lovell take't of me,12
Sleep in their graves.,12
The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,12
O' the rolls and the king's secretary; further sir,12
With which the time will load him. The archbishop,12
One syllable against him?,12
There are that dare; and I myself have ventured,12
Sir I may tell it you I think I have,12
For so I know he is they know he is,12
That does infect the land: with which they moved,12
Given ear to our complaint of his great grace,12
Our reasons laid before him hath commanded,12
He be convented. He's a rank weed Sir Thomas,12
I hinder you too long: good night Sir Thomas.,12
Exeunt GARDINER and Page,12
Charles I will play no more tonight;,12
Sir I did never win of you before.,12
Nor shall not when my fancy's on my play.,12
I could not personally deliver to her,12
I sent your message; who return'd her thanks,12
Most heartily to pray for her.,12
To pray for her? what is she crying out?,12
Almost each pang a death.,12
God safely quit her of her burthen and,12
Your highness with an heir!,12
Prithee to bed; and in thy prayers remember,12
For I must think of that which company,12
I wish your highness,12
Remember in my prayers.,12
Exit SUFFOLK,12
Well sir what follows?,12
As you commanded me.,12
Ay my good lord.,12
He attends your highness' pleasure.,12
[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:,12
Re-enter DENNY with CRANMER,12
LOVELL seems to stay,12
Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY,12
I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?,12
How now my lord! you desire to know,12
[Kneeling]              It is my duty,12
Pray you arise,12
Come you and I must walk a turn together;,12
Ah my good lord I grieve at what I speak,12
I have and most unwillingly of late,12
Grievous complaints of you; which being consider'd,12
This morning come before us; where I know,12
But that till further trial in those charges,12
Your patience to you and be well contented,12
It fits we thus proceed or else no witness,12
[Kneeling],12
And am right glad to catch this good occasion,12
And corn shall fly asunder: for I know,12
Than I myself poor man.,12
Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted,12
Prithee let's walk. Now by my holidame.,12
You would have given me your petition that,12
Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,12
Most dread liege,12
If they shall fail I with mine enemies,12
Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing,12
Know you not,12
Your enemies are many and not small; their practises,12
The justice and the truth o' the question carries,12
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt,12
You are potently opposed; and with a malice,12
I mean in perjured witness than your master,12
Upon this naughty earth? Go to go to;,12
And woo your own destruction.,12
Protect mine innocence or I fall into,12
Be of good cheer;,12
Keep comfort to you; and this morning see,12
In charging you with matters to commit you,12
Fail not to use and with what vehemency,12
Will render you no remedy this ring,12
There make before them. Look the good man weeps!,12
I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul,12
And do as I have bid you.,12
He has strangled,12
Enter Old Lady LOVELL following,12
I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring,12
Fly o'er thy royal head and shade thy person,12
Now by thy looks,12
Say ay; and of a boy.,12
And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven,12
Promises boys hereafter. Sir your queen,12
Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you,12
Lovell!,12
Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.,12
An hundred marks! By this light I'll ha' more.,12
I will have more or scold it out of him.,12
I will have more or else unsay't; and now,12
Exeunt,12
attending.,12
I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,12
To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!,12
Enter Keeper,12
But yet I cannot help you.,12
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS,12
So.,12
I came this way so happily: the king,12
Exit,12
The king's physician: as he pass'd along,12
Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain,12
God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--,12
Wait else at door a fellow-counsellor,12
Must be fulfill'd and I attend with patience.,12
I'll show your grace the strangest sight--,12
I think your highness saw this many a day.,12
There my lord:,12
Who holds his state at door 'mongst pursuivants,12
Ha! 'tis he indeed:,12
Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought,12
At least good manners as not thus to suffer,12
To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,12
By holy Mary Butts there's knavery:,12
We shall hear more anon.,12
SCENE III. The Council-Chamber.,12
Speak to the business master-secretary:,12
Please your honours,12
Has he had knowledge of it?,12
Who waits there?,12
Yes.,12
And has done half an hour to know your pleasures.,12
Your grace may enter now.,12
My good lord archbishop I'm very sorry,12
That chair stand empty: but we all are men,12
Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty,12
Have misdemean'd yourself and not a little,12
The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains,12
Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,12
Which reformation must be sudden too,12
Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,12
Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,12
To one man's honour this contagious sickness,12
Commotions uproars with a general taint,12
The upper Germany can dearly witness,12
My good lords hitherto in all the progress,12
And with no little study that my teaching,12
Might go one way and safely; and the end,12
I speak it with a single heart my lords,12
Both in his private conscience and his place,12
Pray heaven the king may never find a heart,12
Envy and crooked malice nourishment,12
That in this case of justice my accusers,12
And freely urge against me.,12
That cannot be: you are a counsellor,12
My lord because we have business of more moment,12
And our consent for better trial of you,12
Where being but a private man again,12
More than I fear you are provided for.,12
You are always my good friend; if your will pass,12
You are so merciful: I see your end;,12
Become a churchman better than ambition:,12
Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,12
I make as little doubt as you do conscience,12
But reverence to your calling makes me modest.,12
That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,12
My Lord of Winchester you are a little,12
However faulty yet should find respect,12
To load a falling man.,12
I cry your honour mercy; you may worst,12
Why my lord?,12
Of this new sect? ye are not sound.,12
Not sound I say.,12
Men's prayers then would seek you not their fears.,12
Do.,12
This is too much;,12
I have done.,12
Then thus for you my lord: it stands agreed,12
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;,12
Be known unto us: are you all agreed lords?,12
Is there no other way of mercy,12
What other,12
Let some o' the guard be ready there.,12
For me?,12
Receive him,12
Stay good my lords,12
By virtue of that ring I take my cause,12
To a most noble judge the king my master.,12
Tis no counterfeit.,12
When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,12
Do you think my lords,12
Of this man to be vex'd?,12
How much more is his life in value with him?,12
My mind gave me,12
Against this man whose honesty the devil,12
Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!,12
Dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven,12
Not only good and wise but most religious:,12
The chief aim of his honour; and to strengthen,12
His royal self in judgment comes to hear,12
You were ever good at sudden commendations,12
To hear such flattery now and in my presence;,12
To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,12
But whatsoe'er thou takest me for I'm sure,12
To CRANMER,12
He that dares most but wag his finger at thee:,12
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.,12
No sir it does not please me.,12
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.,12
This good man--few of you deserve that title--,12
At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?,12
Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye,12
Not as a groom: there's some of ye I see,12
Would try him to the utmost had ye mean;,12
Thus far,12
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed,12
If there be faith in men meant for his trial,12
I'm sure in me.,12
Take him and use him well he's worthy of it.,12
May be beholding to a subject I,12
Make me no more ado but all embrace him:,12
Canterbury,12
That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,12
The greatest monarch now alive may glory,12
That am a poor and humble subject to you?,12
shall have two noble partners with you; the old,12
these please you?,12
Embrace and love this man.,12
And brother-love I do it.,12
Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.,12
The common voice I see is verified,12
A shrewd turn and he is your friend for ever.',12
To have this young one made a Christian.,12
So I grow stronger you more honour gain.,12
SCENE IV. The palace yard.,12
You'll leave your noise anon ye rascals: do you,12
leave your gaping.,12
Good master porter I belong to the larder.,12
this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree,12
em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing,12
you rude rascals?,12
Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--,12
On May-day morning; which will never be:,12
How got they in and be hang'd?,12
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--,12
I made no spare sir.,12
I am not Samson nor Sir Guy nor Colbrand,12
That had a head to hit either young or old,12
Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again,12
Within,12
I shall be with you presently good master puppy.,12
What would you have me do?,12
dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have,12
court the women so besiege us? Bless me what a,12
conscience this one christening will beget a,12
The spoons will be the bigger sir. There is a,12
brazier by his face for o' my conscience twenty,12
about him are under the line they need no other,12
the head and three times was his nose discharged,12
blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small,12
porringer fell off her head for kindling such a,12
and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I,12
her succor which were the hope o' the Strand where,12
place: at length they came to the broom-staff to,12
boys behind 'em loose shot delivered such a shower,12
and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst,12
These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,12
the tribulation of Tower-hill or the limbs of,12
I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum and there they,12
running banquet of two beadles that is to come.,12
Mercy o' me what a multitude are here!,12
As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,12
There's a trim rabble let in: are all these,12
Great store of room no doubt left for the ladies,12
An't please,12
We are but men; and what so many may do,12
An army cannot rule 'em.,12
If the king blame me for't I'll lay ye all,12
Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;,12
Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;,12
Go break among the press and find a way out,12
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.,12
You great fellow,12
You i' the camlet get up o' the rail;,12
Exeunt,12
Enter trumpets sounding; then two Aldermen Lord  Mayor Garter CRANMER NORFOLK with his marshal's  staff SUFFOLK two Noblemen bearing great  standing-bowls for the christening-gifts; then  four Noblemen bearing a canopy under which the  Duchess of Norfolk godmother bearing the child  richly habited in a mantle  and c. train borne by a  Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset the  other godmother and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage and Garter speaks,12
life long and ever happy to the high and mighty,12
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard,12
My noble partners and myself thus pray:,12
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,12
Thank you good lord archbishop:,12
Elizabeth.,12
KING HENRY VIII kisses the child,12
Into whose hand I give thy life.,12
My noble gossips ye have been too prodigal:,12
When she has so much English.,12
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter,12
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--,12
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,12
But few now living can behold that goodness--,12
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never,12
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,12
With all the virtues that attend the good,12
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:,12
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,12
In her days every man shall eat in safety,12
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:,12
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,12
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when,12
Her ashes new create another heir,12
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,12
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour,12
And so stand fix'd: peace plenty love truth terror,12
Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him:,12
His honour and the greatness of his name,12
And like a mountain cedar reach his branches,12
Shall see this and bless heaven.,12
She shall be to the happiness of England,12
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.,12
She must the saints must have her; yet a virgin,12
To the ground and all the world shall mourn her.,12
Thou hast made me now a man! never before,12
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,12
To see what this child does and praise my Maker.,12
And your good brethren I am much beholding;,12
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way lords:,12
She will be sick else. This day no man think,12
This little one shall make it holiday.,12
EPILOGUE,12
All that are here: some come to take their ease,12
We have frighted with our trumpets; so 'tis clear,12
Abused extremely and to cry 'That's witty!',12
All the expected good we're like to hear,12
The merciful construction of good women;,12
And say 'twill do I know within a while,12
If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.,12
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.,13
Now say Chatillon what would France with us?,13
In my behavior to the majesty,13
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!',13
Philip of France in right and true behalf,13
Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim,13
To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine,13
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,13
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.,13
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,13
Here have we war for war and blood for blood,13
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,13
Bear mine to him and so depart in peace:,13
For ere thou canst report I will be there,13
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath,13
An honourable conduct let him have:,13
Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE,13
How that ambitious Constance would not cease,13
Upon the right and party of her son?,13
With very easy arguments of love,13
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.,13
Your strong possession much more than your right,13
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,13
Enter a Sheriff,13
Come from country to be judged by you,13
Let them approach.,13
This expedition's charge.,13
What men are you?,13
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,13
A soldier by the honour-giving hand,13
What art thou?,13
Is that the elder and art thou the heir?,13
Most certain of one mother mighty king;,13
But for the certain knowledge of that truth,13
Of that I doubt as all men's children may.,13
And wound her honour with this diffidence.,13
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;,13
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:,13
A good blunt fellow. Why being younger born,13
I know not why except to get the land.,13
But whether I be as true begot or no,13
But that I am as well begot my liege--,13
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.,13
And were our father and this son like him,13
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!,13
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;,13
Do you not read some tokens of my son,13
Mine eye hath well examined his parts,13
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?,13
With half that face would he have all my land:,13
My gracious liege when that my father lived,13
Well sir by this you cannot get my land:,13
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy,13
To treat of high affairs touching that time.,13
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;,13
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores,13
As I have heard my father speak himself,13
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd,13
That this my mother's son was none of his;,13
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.,13
My father's land as was my father's will.,13
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,13
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands,13
Who as you say took pains to get this son,13
In sooth good friend your father might have kept,13
In sooth he might; then if he were my brother's,13
Being none of his refuse him: this concludes;,13
Your father's heir must have your father's land.,13
To dispossess that child which is not his?,13
Than was his will to get me as I think.,13
And like thy brother to enjoy thy land,13
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?,13
And I had his sir Robert's his like him;,13
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd my face so thin,13
Lest men should say 'Look where three-farthings goes!',13
Would I might never stir from off this place,13
I would not be sir Nob in any case.,13
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?,13
Brother take you my land I'll take my chance.,13
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.,13
Nay I would have you go before me thither.,13
What is thy name?,13
Philip good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.,13
Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great,13
Brother by the mother's side give me your hand:,13
Now blessed by the hour by night or day,13
The very spirit of Plantagenet!,13
Madam by chance but not by truth; what though?,13
In at the window or else o'er the hatch:,13
And have is have however men do catch:,13
And I am I howe'er I was begot.,13
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.,13
For France for France for it is more than need.,13
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.,13
A foot of honour better than I was;,13
Well now can I make any Joan a lady.,13
And if his name be George I'll call him Peter;,13
Tis too respective and too sociable,13
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,13
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise,13
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,13
And then comes answer like an Absey book:,13
At your employment; at your service sir;',13
And so ere answer knows what question would,13
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,13
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.,13
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,13
That doth not smack of observation;,13
And not alone in habit and device,13
But from the inward motion to deliver,13
Which though I will not practise to deceive,13
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.,13
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband,13
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY,13
What brings you here to court so hastily?,13
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?,13
Colbrand the giant that same mighty man?,13
Sir Robert's son! Ay thou unreverend boy,13
He is sir Robert's son and so art thou.,13
Good leave good Philip.,13
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.,13
Madam I was not old sir Robert's son:,13
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:,13
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:,13
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?,13
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,13
What means this scorn thou most untoward knave?,13
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.,13
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;,13
Then good my mother let me know my father;,13
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?,13
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:,13
To make room for him in my husband's bed:,13
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,13
Now by this light were I to get again,13
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,13
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,13
Against whose fury and unmatched force,13
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.,13
May easily win a woman's. Ay my mother,13
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well,13
Come lady I will show thee to my kin;,13
If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin:,13
Exeunt,13
SCENE I. France. Before Angiers.,13
Before Angiers well met brave Austria.,13
Richard that robb'd the lion of his heart,13
By this brave duke came early to his grave:,13
At our importance hither is he come,13
And to rebuke the usurpation,13
Embrace him love him give him welcome hither.,13
The rather that you give his offspring life,13
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,13
Welcome before the gates of Angiers duke.,13
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,13
That to my home I will no more return,13
Together with that pale that white-faced shore,13
And coops from other lands her islanders,13
That water-walled bulwark still secure,13
Even till that utmost corner of the west,13
Will I not think of home but follow arms.,13
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength,13
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords,13
Well then to work: our cannon shall be bent,13
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,13
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,13
But we will make it subject to this boy.,13
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:,13
That right in peace which here we urge in war,13
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.,13
A wonder lady! lo upon thy wish,13
What England says say briefly gentle lord;,13
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege,13
England impatient of your just demands,13
Whose leisure I have stay'd have given him time,13
His marches are expedient to this town,13
With him along is come the mother-queen,13
With her her niece the Lady Blanch of Spain;,13
And all the unsettled humours of the land,13
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,13
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,13
In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits,13
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,13
Drum beats,13
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,13
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!,13
We must awake endavour for defence;,13
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.,13
Peace be to France if France in peace permit,13
If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven,13
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.,13
From France to England there to live in peace.,13
With burden of our armour here we sweat.,13
But thou from loving England art so far,13
Cut off the sequence of posterity,13
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.,13
These eyes these brows were moulded out of his:,13
Which died in Geffrey and the hand of time,13
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,13
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God,13
When living blood doth in these temples beat,13
From whom hast thou this great commission France,13
From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts,13
To look into the blots and stains of right:,13
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,13
Alack thou dost usurp authority.,13
Who is it thou dost call usurper France?,13
Out insolent! thy bastard shall be king,13
My bed was ever to thy son as true,13
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey,13
As rain to water or devil to his dam.,13
His father never was so true begot:,13
There's a good mother boy that blots thy father.,13
Peace!,13
What the devil art thou?,13
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:,13
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;,13
Sirrah look to't; i' faith I will i' faith.,13
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!,13
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:,13
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.,13
With this abundance of superfluous breath?,13
Women and fools break off your conference.,13
England and Ireland Anjou Touraine Maine,13
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?,13
Arthur of Bretagne yield thee to my hand;,13
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:,13
Come to thy grandam child.,13
Give grandam kingdom and it grandam will,13
There's a good grandam.,13
I would that I were low laid in my grave:,13
His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps.,13
His grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames,13
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;,13
To do him justice and revenge on you.,13
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!,13
The dominations royalties and rights,13
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:,13
The canon of the law is laid on him,13
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.,13
I have but this to say,13
But God hath made her sin and her the plague,13
And with her plague; her sin his injury,13
All punish'd in the person of this child,13
Thou unadvised scold I can produce,13
Ay who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:,13
Peace lady! pause or be more temperate:,13
To these ill-tuned repetitions.,13
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak,13
Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls,13
Tis France for England.,13
You men of Angiers and my loving subjects--,13
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--,13
These flags of France that are advanced here,13
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:,13
And ready mounted are they to spit forth,13
All preparation for a bloody siege,13
Confronts your city's eyes your winking gates;,13
That as a waist doth girdle you about,13
By this time from their fixed beds of lime,13
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.,13
Who painfully with much expedient march,13
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,13
And now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,13
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,13
Which trust accordingly kind citizens,13
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,13
When I have said make answer to us both.,13
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right,13
Son to the elder brother of this man,13
For this down-trodden equity we tread,13
Being no further enemy to you,13
In the relief of this oppressed child,13
To pay that duty which you truly owe,13
And then our arms like to a muzzled bear,13
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent,13
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,13
We will bear home that lusty blood again,13
And leave your children wives and you in peace.,13
Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls,13
Though all these English and their discipline,13
Then tell us shall your city call us lord,13
Or shall we give the signal to our rage,13
In brief we are the king of England's subjects:,13
Acknowledge then the king and let me in.,13
To him will we prove loyal: till that time,13
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?,13
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed--,13
To verify our title with their lives.,13
Some bastards too.,13
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,13
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls,13
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet,13
Amen amen! Mount chevaliers! to arms!,13
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,13
To AUSTRIA,13
At your den sirrah with your lioness,13
And make a monster of you.,13
O tremble for you hear the lion roar.,13
In best appointment all our regiments.,13
It shall be so; and at the other hill,13
Exeunt,13
You men of Angiers open wide your gates,13
Who by the hand of France this day hath made,13
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;,13
Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;,13
Upon the dancing banners of the French,13
To enter conquerors and to proclaim,13
Enter English Herald with trumpet,13
King John your king and England's doth approach,13
Their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright,13
There stuck no plume in any English crest,13
Our colours do return in those same hands,13
And like a troop of jolly huntsmen come,13
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:,13
Heralds from off our towers we might behold,13
Of both your armies; whose equality,13
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;,13
Both are alike; and both alike we like.,13
We hold our town for neither yet for both.,13
France hast thou yet more blood to cast away?,13
Whose passage vex'd with thy impediment,13
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,13
A peaceful progress to the ocean.,13
In this hot trial more than we of France;,13
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,13
We'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms we bear,13
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss,13
Ha majesty! how high thy glory towers,13
O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;,13
And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men,13
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?,13
You equal potents fiery kindled spirits!,13
The other's peace: till then blows blood and death!,13
Speak citizens for England; who's your king?,13
Know him in us that here hold up his right.,13
And bear possession of our person here,13
A greater power then we denies all this;,13
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;,13
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.,13
And stand securely on their battlements,13
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.,13
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,13
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:,13
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,13
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:,13
Even till unfenced desolation,13
That done dissever your united strengths,13
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;,13
Out of one side her happy minion,13
And kiss him with a glorious victory.,13
Smacks it not something of the policy?,13
I like it well. France shall we knit our powers,13
Then after fight who shall be king of it?,13
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,13
As we will ours against these saucy walls;,13
Why then defy each other and pell-mell,13
Let it be so. Say where will you assault?,13
Into this city's bosom.,13
Our thunder from the south,13
O prudent discipline! From north to south:,13
I'll stir them to it. Come away away!,13
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;,13
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,13
Persever not but hear me mighty kings.,13
That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch,13
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:,13
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?,13
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?,13
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?,13
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:,13
And she again wants nothing to name want,13
He is the half part of a blessed man,13
And she a fair divided excellence,13
O two such silver currents when they join,13
And two such shores to two such streams made one,13
To these two princes if you marry them.,13
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,13
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,13
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,13
More free from motion no not Death himself,13
As we to keep this city.,13
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death,13
That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas,13
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!,13
He speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce;,13
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his,13
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words,13
Son list to this conjunction make this match;,13
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie,13
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe,13
I see a yielding in the looks of France;,13
Are capable of this ambition,13
Of soft petitions pity and remorse,13
Why answer not the double majesties,13
Speak England first that hath been forward first,13
If that the Dauphin there thy princely son,13
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:,13
And all that we upon this side the sea,13
Find liable to our crown and dignity,13
In titles honours and promotions,13
Holds hand with any princess of the world.,13
I do my lord; and in her eye I find,13
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:,13
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:,13
Till now infixed I beheld myself,13
Whispers with BLANCH,13
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!,13
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,13
In such a love so vile a lout as he.,13
If he see aught in you that makes him like,13
I can with ease translate it to my will;,13
I will enforce it easily to my love.,13
That all I see in you is worthy love,13
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,13
What say these young ones? What say you my niece?,13
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.,13
Nay ask me if I can refrain from love;,13
Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine,13
With her to thee; and this addition more,13
Philip of France if thou be pleased withal,13
It likes us well; young princes close your hands.,13
That I did so when I was first assured.,13
Let in that amity which you have made;,13
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.,13
I know she is not for this match made up,13
Where is she and her son? tell me who knows.,13
And by my faith this league that we have made,13
Brother of England how may we content,13
Which we God knows have turn'd another way,13
We will heal up all;,13
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town,13
Some speedy messenger bid her repair,13
If not fill up the measure of her will,13
That we shall stop her exclamation.,13
To this unlook'd for unprepared pomp.,13
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!,13
Hath willingly departed with a part,13
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field,13
With that same purpose-changer that sly devil,13
That daily break-vow he that wins of all,13
Who having no external thing to lose,13
That smooth-faced gentleman tickling Commodity,13
The world who of itself is peised well,13
Till this advantage this vile-drawing bias,13
Makes it take head from all indifferency,13
And this same bias this Commodity,13
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,13
From a resolved and honourable war,13
And why rail I on this Commodity?,13
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,13
But for my hand as unattempted yet,13
Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail,13
And being rich my virtue then shall be,13
Since kings break faith upon commodity,13
Exit,13
SCENE I. The French King's pavilion.,13
Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!,13
Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces?,13
Be well advised tell o'er thy tale again:,13
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word,13
Believe me I do not believe thee man;,13
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,13
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,13
A woman naturally born to fears;,13
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,13
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?,13
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?,13
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?,13
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,13
As true as I believe you think them false,13
O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,13
And let belief and life encounter so,13
Which in the very meeting fall and die.,13
France friend with England what becomes of me?,13
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.,13
But spoke the harm that is by others done?,13
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.,13
If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim,13
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,13
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,13
For then I should not love thee no nor thou,13
But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy,13
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,13
She is corrupted changed and won from thee;,13
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France,13
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.,13
That strumpet Fortune that usurping John!,13
Envenom him with words or get thee gone,13
Am bound to under-bear.,13
I may not go without you to the kings.,13

Or if it must stand still let wives with child,13
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:,13
No bargains break that are not this day made:,13
Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change!,13
To curse the fair proceedings of this day:,13
You have beguiled me with a counterfeit,13
Proves valueless: you are forsworn forsworn;,13
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:,13

Arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings!,13

Thou little valiant great in villany!,13
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight,13

Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,13
Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength,13
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,13
O that a man should speak those words to me!,13
Thou darest not say so villain for thy life.,13
We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.,13
Here comes the holy legate of the pope.,13
To thee King John my holy errand is.,13
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,13
Why thou against the church our holy mother,13
Keep Stephen Langton chosen archbishop,13
This in our foresaid holy father's name,13
What earthy name to interrogatories,13
Thou canst not cardinal devise a name,13
To charge me to an answer as the pope.,13
Add thus much more that no Italian priest,13
But as we under heaven are supreme head,13
Where we do reign we will alone uphold,13
So tell the pope all reverence set apart,13
Brother of England you blaspheme in this.,13
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,13
And by the merit of vile gold dross dust,13
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,13
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,13
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.,13
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.,13
From his allegiance to an heretic;,13
Canonized and worshipped as a saint,13
Thy hateful life.,13
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!,13
To my keen curses; for without my wrong,13
There's law and warrant lady for my curse.,13
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:,13
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;,13
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?,13
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;,13
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.,13
Look to that devil; lest that France repent,13
King Philip listen to the cardinal.,13
Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs Because--,13
Philip what say'st thou to the cardinal?,13
Bethink you father; for the difference,13
Or the light loss of England for a friend:,13
That's the curse of Rome.,13
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.,13
But from her need.,13
Which only lives but by the death of faith,13
That faith would live again by death of need.,13
Keep my need up and faith is trodden down!,13
O be removed from him and answer well!,13
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin most sweet lout.,13
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,13
Good reverend father make my person yours,13
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,13
Married in league coupled and linked together,13
The latest breath that gave the sound of words,13
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,13
No longer than we well could wash our hands,13
Heaven knows they were besmear'd and over-stain'd,13
The fearful difference of incensed kings:,13
So newly join'd in love so strong in both,13
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,13
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,13
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,13
Of true sincerity? O holy sir,13
Out of your grace devise ordain impose,13
To do your pleasure and continue friends.,13
Save what is opposite to England's love.,13
Or let the church our mother breathe her curse,13
France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,13
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,13
I may disjoin my hand but not my faith.,13
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,13
First made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd,13
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself,13
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss,13
And being not done where doing tends to ill,13
The better act of purposes mistook,13
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,13
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.,13
But thou hast sworn against religion,13
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth,13
To swear swears only not to be forsworn;,13
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;,13
Therefore thy later vows against thy first,13
And better conquest never canst thou make,13
Against these giddy loose suggestions:,13
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not then know,13
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,13
Rebellion flat rebellion!,13
Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?,13
Upon thy wedding-day?,13
What shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?,13
Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp?,13
Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,13
Upon my knee I beg go not to arms,13
O upon my knee,13
Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom,13
Now shall I see thy love: what motive may,13
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,13
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,13
I will denounce a curse upon his head.,13
O fair return of banish'd majesty!,13
France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.,13
Is it as he will? well then France shall rue.,13
Which is the side that I must go withal?,13
And in their rage I having hold of both,13
Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win;,13
Father I may not wish the fortune thine;,13
Whoever wins on that side shall I lose,13
Lady with me with me thy fortune lies.,13
Cousin go draw our puissance together.,13
France I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;,13
That nothing can allay nothing but blood,13
Thy rage sham burn thee up and thou shalt turn,13
Look to thyself thou art in jeopardy.,13
Exeunt,13
Alarums excursions. Enter the BASTARD with AUSTRIA'S head,13
Some airy devil hovers in the sky,13
While Philip breathes.,13
Hubert keep this boy. Philip make up:,13
And ta'en I fear.,13
Her highness is in safety fear you not:,13
Will bring this labour to an happy end.,13
SCENE III. The same.,13
[To QUEEN ELINOR]  So shall it be; your grace shall,13
So strongly guarded.,13
Cousin look not sad:,13
As dear be to thee as thy father was.,13
[To the BASTARD]  Cousin away for England!,13
And ere our coming see thou shake the bags,13
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace,13
Use our commission in his utmost force.,13
When gold and silver becks me to come on.,13
If ever I remember to be holy,13
Farewell gentle cousin.,13
Exit the BASTARD,13
Come hither Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,13
There is a soul counts thee her creditor,13
And my good friend thy voluntary oath,13
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,13
By heaven Hubert I am almost ashamed,13
I am much bounden to your majesty.,13
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,13
I had a thing to say but let it go:,13
Attended with the pleasures of the world,13
To give me audience: if the midnight bell,13
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;,13
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,13
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,13
Making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes,13
A passion hateful to my purposes,13
Hear me without thine ears and make reply,13
Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words;,13
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:,13
And by my troth I think thou lovest me well.,13
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,13
Do not I know thou wouldst?,13
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what my friend,13
And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,13
Thou art his keeper.,13
That he shall not offend your majesty.,13
My lord?,13
He shall not live.,13
I could be merry now. Hubert I love thee;,13
Remember. Madam fare you well:,13
My blessing go with thee!,13
Hubert shall be your man attend on you,13
Exeunt,13
Enter KING PHILIP LEWIS CARDINAL PANDULPH and Attendants,13
A whole armado of convicted sail,13
Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.,13
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?,13
And bloody England into England gone,13
What he hath won that hath he fortified:,13
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,13
Of any kindred action like to this?,13
So we could find some pattern of our shame.,13
Look who comes here! a grave unto a soul;,13
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.,13
Lo now I now see the issue of your peace.,13
No I defy all counsel all redress,13
Death death; O amiable lovely death!,13
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,13
And I will kiss thy detestable bones,13
And ring these fingers with thy household worms,13
And be a carrion monster like thyself:,13
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,13
O fair affliction peace!,13
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!,13
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy,13
Which scorns a modern invocation.,13
Thou art not holy to belie me so;,13
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;,13
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!,13
O if I could what grief should I forget!,13
And thou shalt be canonized cardinal;,13
My reasonable part produces reason,13
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:,13
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:,13
The different plague of each calamity.,13
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!,13
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends,13
Like true inseparable faithful loves,13
To England if you will.,13
Yes that I will; and wherefore will I do it?,13
O that these hands could so redeem my son,13
But now I envy at their liberty,13
Because my poor child is a prisoner.,13
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:,13
For since the birth of Cain the first male child,13
There was not such a gracious creature born.,13
And chase the native beauty from his cheek,13
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,13
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven,13
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.,13
He talks to me that never had a son.,13
Grief fills the room up of my absent child,13
Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words,13
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;,13
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,13
I will not keep this form upon my head,13
O Lord! my boy my Arthur my fair son!,13
My widow-comfort and my sorrows' cure!,13
I fear some outrage and I'll follow her.,13
There's nothing in this world can make me joy:,13
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;,13
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.,13
Even in the instant of repair and health,13
On their departure most of all show evil:,13
All days of glory joy and happiness.,13
No no; when Fortune means to men most good,13
Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost,13
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?,13
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.,13
For even the breath of what I mean to speak,13
Out of the path which shall directly lead,13
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be,13
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,13
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand,13
And he that stands upon a slippery place,13
That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall;,13
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?,13
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.,13
How green you are and fresh in this old world!,13
For he that steeps his safety in true blood,13
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts,13
That none so small advantage shall step forth,13
No natural exhalation in the sky,13
No common wind no customed event,13
And call them meteors prodigies and signs,13
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.,13
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.,13
If that young Arthur be not gone already,13
Of all his people shall revolt from him,13
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath,13
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:,13
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge,13
Offending charity: if but a dozen French,13
To train ten thousand English to their side,13
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,13
What may be wrought out of their discontent,13
For England go: I will whet on the king.,13
If you say ay the king will not say no.,13
ACT IV,13
Enter HUBERT and Executioners,13
Within the arras: when I strike my foot,13
And bind the boy which you shall find with me,13
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.,13
Exeunt Executioners,13
Enter ARTHUR,13
Good morrow little prince.,13
To be more prince as may be. You are sad.,13
Mercy on me!,13
Yet I remember when I was in France,13
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,13
I should be as merry as the day is long;,13
My uncle practises more harm to me:,13
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?,13
I were your son so you would love me Hubert.,13
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:,13
Are you sick Hubert? you look pale to-day:,13
That I might sit all night and watch with you:,13
[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.,13
Showing a paper,13
How now foolish rheum!,13
I must be brief lest resolution drop,13
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?,13
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?,13
And will you?,13
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,13
The best I had a princess wrought it me,13
And with my hand at midnight held your head,13
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,13
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?',13
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;,13
Nay you may think my love was crafty love,13
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,13
These eyes that never did nor never shall,13
I have sworn to do it;,13
Ah none but in this iron age would do it!,13
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears,13
Even in the matter of mine innocence;,13
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.,13
An if an angel should have come to me,13
I would not have believed him--no tongue but Hubert's.,13
Stamps,13
Do as I bid you do.,13
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.,13
Alas what need you be so boisterous-rough?,13
For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound!,13
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;,13
Nor look upon the iron angerly:,13
Whatever torment you do put me to.,13
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.,13
Alas I then have chid away my friend!,13
Let him come back that his compassion may,13
Come boy prepare yourself.,13
None but to lose your eyes.,13
A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair,13
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,13
Is this your promise? go to hold your tongue.,13
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:,13
Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue,13
Though to no use but still to look on you!,13
And would not harm me.,13
No in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,13
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;,13
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out,13
But with my breath I can revive it boy.,13
And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert:,13
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,13
All things that you should use to do me wrong,13
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,13
Well see to live; I will not touch thine eye,13
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose boy,13
O now you look like Hubert! all this while,13
Peace; no more. Adieu.,13
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:,13
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world,13
O heaven! I thank you Hubert.,13
Much danger do I undergo for thee.,13
SCENE II. KING JOHN'S palace.,13
Here once again we sit once again crown'd,13
This 'once again' but that your highness pleased,13
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,13
Fresh expectation troubled not the land,13
Therefore to be possess'd with double pomp,13
To gild refined gold to paint the lily,13
To smooth the ice or add another hue,13
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,13
But that your royal pleasure must be done,13
And in the last repeating troublesome,13
In this the antique and well noted face,13
And like a shifted wind unto a sail,13
Startles and frights consideration,13
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.,13
They do confound their skill in covetousness;,13
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,13
Discredit more in hiding of the fault,13
To this effect before you were new crown'd,13
To overbear it and we are all well pleased,13
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.,13
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;,13
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask,13
And well shall you perceive how willingly,13
Then I as one that am the tongue of these,13
Both for myself and them but chief of all,13
Bend their best studies heartily request,13
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent,13
If what in rest you have in right you hold,13
The steps of wrong should move you to mew up,13
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth,13
That the time's enemies may not have this,13
That you have bid us ask his liberty;,13
Than whereupon our weal on you depending,13
Enter HUBERT,13
To your direction. Hubert what news with you?,13
This is the man should do the bloody deed;,13
The image of a wicked heinous fault,13
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;,13
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.,13
Between his purpose and his conscience,13
His passion is so ripe it needs must break.,13
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.,13
Good lords although my will to give is living,13
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.,13
Indeed we heard how near his death he was,13
This must be answer'd either here or hence.,13
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?,13
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame,13
So thrive it in your game! and so farewell.,13
And find the inheritance of this poor child,13
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,13
This must not be thus borne: this will break out,13
Exeunt Lords,13
There is no sure foundation set on blood,13
Enter a Messenger,13
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?,13
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?,13
For any foreign preparation,13
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;,13
The tidings come that they are all arrived.,13
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,13
And she not hear of it?,13
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died,13
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died,13
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.,13
O make a league with me till I have pleased,13
How wildly then walks my estate in France!,13
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?,13
Thou hast made me giddy,13
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret,13
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff,13
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,13
Bear with me cousin for I was amazed,13
Aloft the flood and can give audience,13
How I have sped among the clergymen,13
But as I travell'd hither through the land,13
Possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams,13
And here a prophet that I brought with me,13
With many hundreds treading on his heels;,13
That ere the next Ascension-day at noon,13
Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so?,13
Hubert away with him; imprison him;,13
I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd.,13
For I must use thee.,13
O my gentle cousin,13
The French my lord; men's mouths are full of it:,13
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,13
Of Arthur who they say is kill'd to-night,13
Gentle kinsman go,13
I have a way to win their loves again;,13
I will seek them out.,13
O let me have no subject enemies,13
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!,13
And fly like thought from them to me again.,13
Exit,13
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need,13
And be thou he.,13
Exit,13
Re-enter HUBERT,13
Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about,13
Five moons!,13
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:,13
And when they talk of him they shake their heads,13
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,13
With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes.,13
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,13
Who with his shears and measure in his hand,13
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,13
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:,13
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.,13
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?,13
To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him.,13
It is the curse of kings to be attended,13
To break within the bloody house of life,13
To understand a law to know the meaning,13
More upon humour than advised respect.,13
O when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth,13
Witness against us to damnation!,13
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,13
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,13
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,13
Apt liable to be employ'd in danger,13
And thou to be endeared to a king,13
My lord--,13
When I spake darkly what I purposed,13
As bid me tell my tale in express words,13
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:,13
And didst in signs again parley with sin;,13
And consequently thy rude hand to act,13
Out of my sight and never see me more!,13
Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers:,13
This kingdom this confine of blood and breath,13
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.,13
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.,13
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,13
Within this bosom never enter'd yet,13
And you have slander'd nature in my form,13
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind,13
Doth Arthur live? O haste thee to the peers,13
And make them tame to their obedience!,13
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,13
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.,13
The angry lords with all expedient haste.,13
Exeunt,13
Enter ARTHUR on the walls,13
Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not!,13
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.,13
If I get down and do not break my limbs,13
As good to die and go as die and stay.,13
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:,13
Dies,13
Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:,13
This gentle offer of the perilous time.,13
The Count Melun a noble lord of France,13
Is much more general than these lines import.,13
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be,13
Enter the BASTARD,13
The king by me requests your presence straight.,13
We will not line his thin bestained cloak,13
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.,13
Whate'er you think good words I think were best.,13
But there is little reason in your grief;,13
Sir sir impatience hath his privilege.,13
This is the prison. What is he lies here?,13
O death made proud with pure and princely beauty!,13
Murder as hating what himself hath done,13
Or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,13
Sir Richard what think you? have you beheld,13
Or do you almost think although you see,13
Form such another? This is the very top,13
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,13
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage,13
All murders past do stand excused in this:,13
Shall give a holiness a purity,13
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,13
It is a damned and a bloody work;,13
If that it be the work of any hand.,13
We had a kind of light what would ensue:,13
The practise and the purpose of the king:,13
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,13
The incense of a vow a holy vow,13
Never to be infected with delight,13
Till I have set a glory to this hand,13
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.,13
Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you:,13
O he is old and blushes not at death.,13
I am no villain.,13
Drawing his sword,13
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.,13
By heaven I think my sword's as sharp as yours:,13
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;,13
Your worth your greatness and nobility.,13
Not for my life: but yet I dare defend,13
Thou art a murderer.,13
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,13
Cut him to pieces.,13
Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge.,13
If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot,13
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;,13
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.,13
Second a villain and a murderer?,13
Who kill'd this prince?,13
I honour'd him I loved him and will weep,13
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,13
And he long traded in it makes it seem,13
Away with me all you whose souls abhor,13
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.,13
There tell the king he may inquire us out.,13
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?,13
Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death,13
Do but hear me sir.,13
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay nothing is so black;,13
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell,13
Upon my soul--,13
To this most cruel act do but despair;,13
That ever spider twisted from her womb,13
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,13
And it shall be as all the ocean,13
I do suspect thee very grievously.,13
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath,13
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.,13
Go bear him in thine arms.,13
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.,13
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,13
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left,13
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.,13
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest,13
Now powers from home and discontents at home,13
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,13
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can,13
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:,13
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.,13
ACT V,13
Enter KING JOHN CARDINAL PANDULPH and Attendants,13
The circle of my glory.,13
Take again,13
Your sovereign greatness and authority.,13
And from his holiness use all your power,13
Our discontented counties do revolt;,13
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul,13
This inundation of mistemper'd humour,13
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,13
Or overthrow incurable ensues.,13
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;,13
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war,13
On this Ascension-day remember well,13
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.,13
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet,13
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:,13
But heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary.,13
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out,13
Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers:,13
To offer service to your enemy,13
The little number of your doubtful friends.,13
After they heard young Arthur was alive?,13
An empty casket where the jewel of life,13
That villain Hubert told me he did live.,13
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?,13
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust,13
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;,13
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,13
Grow great by your example and put on,13
Away and glister like the god of war,13
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.,13
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?,13
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,13
The legate of the pope hath been with me,13
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers,13
O inglorious league!,13
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,13
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,13
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,13
And find no cheque? Let us my liege to arms:,13
Or if he do let it at least be said,13
Have thou the ordering of this present time.,13
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.,13
SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.,13
My Lord Melun let this be copied out,13
Return the precedent to these lords again;,13
Both they and we perusing o'er these notes,13
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.,13
And noble Dauphin albeit we swear,13
To your proceedings; yet believe me prince,13
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,13
By making many. O it grieves my soul,13
To be a widow-maker! O and there,13
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!,13
That for the health and physic of our right,13
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.,13
That we the sons and children of this isle,13
Wherein we step after a stranger march,13
Her enemies' ranks--I must withdraw and weep,13
To grace the gentry of a land remote,13
What here? O nation that thou couldst remove!,13
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,13
Where these two Christian armies might combine,13
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!,13
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom,13
O what a noble combat hast thou fought,13
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,13
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,13
But this effusion of such manly drops,13
Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed,13
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.,13
And with a great heart heave away the storm:,13
That never saw the giant world enraged;,13
Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping.,13
Into the purse of rich prosperity,13
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.,13
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH,13
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,13
With holy breath.,13
The next is this King John hath reconciled,13
That so stood out against the holy church,13
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;,13
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,13
And be no further harmful than in show.,13
I am too high-born to be propertied,13
Or useful serving-man and instrument,13
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars,13
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;,13
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.,13
Acquainted me with interest to this land,13
And come ye now to tell me John hath made,13
I by the honour of my marriage-bed,13
And now it is half-conquer'd must I back,13
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,13
To underprop this action? Is't not I,13
And such as to my claim are liable,13
Have I not heard these islanders shout out,13
Have I not here the best cards for the game,13
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?,13
You look but on the outside of this work.,13
Till my attempt so much be glorified,13
Before I drew this gallant head of war,13
To outlook conquest and to win renown,13
Trumpet sounds,13
Enter the BASTARD attended,13
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:,13
I come to learn how you have dealt for him;,13
And warrant limited unto my tongue.,13
And will not temporize with my entreaties;,13
By all the blood that ever fury breathed,13
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.,13
This apish and unmannerly approach,13
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,13
To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms,13
That hand which had the strength even at your door,13
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,13
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,13
In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake,13
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;,13
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?,13
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,13
And you degenerate you ingrate revolts,13
Of your dear mother England blush for shame;,13
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,13
Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts,13
There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace;,13
We hold our time too precious to be spent,13
Give me leave to speak.,13
We will attend to neither.,13
Plead for our interest and our being here.,13
And so shall you being beaten: do but start,13
And even at hand a drum is ready braced,13
Sound but another and another shall,13
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,13
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need,13
A bare-ribb'd death whose office is this day,13
Strike up our drums to find this danger out.,13
Exeunt,13
Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT,13
Badly I fear. How fares your majesty?,13
Lies heavy on me; O my heart is sick!,13
My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge,13
And send him word by me which way you go.,13
Be of good comfort; for the great supply,13
Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.,13
The French fight coldly and retire themselves.,13
And will not let me welcome this good news.,13
Weakness possesseth me and I am faint.,13
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,13
I did not think the king so stored with friends.,13
If they miscarry we miscarry too.,13
In spite of spite alone upholds the day.,13
Enter MELUN wounded,13
When we were happy we had other names.,13
Wounded to death.,13
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,13
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;,13
He means to recompense the pains you take,13
And I with him and many moe with me,13
Even on that altar where we swore to you,13
May this be possible? may this be true?,13
Retaining but a quantity of life,13
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?,13
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?,13
That I must die here and live hence by truth?,13
He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours,13
But even this night whose black contagious breath,13
Of the old feeble and day-wearied sun,13
Paying the fine of rated treachery,13
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.,13
The love of him and this respect besides,13
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.,13
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,13
In peace and part this body and my soul,13
We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul,13
Of this most fair occasion by the which,13
And like a bated and retired flood,13
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,13
Even to our ocean to our great King John.,13
For I do see the cruel pangs of death,13
And happy newness that intends old right.,13
SCENE V. The French camp.,13
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,13
When English measure backward their own ground,13
When with a volley of our needless shot,13
And wound our tattering colours clearly up,13
Enter a Messenger,13
Here: what news?,13
By his persuasion are again fall'n off,13
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.,13
I did not think to be so sad to-night,13
King John did fly an hour or two before,13
Whoever spoke it it is true my lord.,13
The day shall not be up so soon as I,13
Exeunt,13
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT severally,13
A friend. What art thou?,13
Whither dost thou go?,13
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?,13
Thou hast a perfect thought:,13
Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well.,13
Who thou wilt: and if thou please,13
I come one way of the Plantagenets.,13
Have done me shame: brave soldier pardon me,13
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.,13
Why here walk I in the black brow of night,13
Brief then; and what's the news?,13
Black fearful comfortless and horrible.,13
I am no woman I'll not swoon at it.,13
I left him almost speechless; and broke out,13
The better arm you to the sudden time,13
How did he take it? who did taste to him?,13
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king,13
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?,13
And brought Prince Henry in their company;,13
And they are all about his majesty.,13
And tempt us not to bear above our power!,13
Passing these flats are taken by the tide;,13
Myself well mounted hardly have escaped.,13
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.,13
SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.,13
It is too late: the life of all his blood,13
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,13
Foretell the ending of mortality.,13
His highness yet doth speak and holds belief,13
It would allay the burning quality,13
Let him be brought into the orchard here.,13
Exit BIGOT,13
Than when you left him; even now he sung.,13
In their continuance will not feel themselves.,13
Leaves them invisible and his siege is now,13
With many legions of strange fantasies,13
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death,13
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,13
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings,13
Be of good comfort prince; for you are born,13
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.,13
Ay marry now my soul hath elbow-room;,13
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,13
I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen,13
Do I shrink up.,13
Poison'd--ill fare--dead forsook cast off:,13
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,13
Through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north,13
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,13
And so ingrateful you deny me that.,13
That might relieve you!,13
Within me is a hell; and there the poison,13
On unreprievable condemned blood.,13
O I am scalded with my violent motion,13
O cousin thou art come to set mine eye:,13
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail,13
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,13
And then all this thou seest is but a clod,13
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,13
For in a night the best part of my power,13
Were in the Washes all unwarily,13
KING JOHN dies,13
My liege! my lord! but now a king now thus.,13
What surety of the world what hope what stay,13
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind,13
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,13
Now now you stars that move in your right spheres,13
And instantly return with me again,13
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.,13
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.,13
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,13
And brings from him such offers of our peace,13
With purpose presently to leave this war.,13
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.,13
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd,13
To the disposing of the cardinal:,13
If you think meet this afternoon will post,13
Let it be so: and you my noble prince,13
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.,13
For so he will'd it.,13
And happily may your sweet self put on,13
To whom with all submission on my knee,13
And true subjection everlastingly.,13
To rest without a spot for evermore.,13
And knows not how to do it but with tears.,13
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.,13
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,13
Now these her princes are come home again,13
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,13
Exeunt,13
SCENE I. Rome. A street.,14
Hence! home you idle creatures get you home:,14
Being mechanical you ought not walk,14
Of your profession? Speak what trade art thou?,14
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?,14
You sir what trade are you?,14
as you would say a cobbler.,14
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe,14
What trade thou knave? thou naughty knave what trade?,14
if you be out sir I can mend you.,14
Why sir cobble you.,14
Truly sir all that I live by is with the awl: I,14
matters but with awl. I am indeed sir a surgeon,14
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon,14
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?,14
Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself,14
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.,14
What tributaries follow him to Rome,14
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things!,14
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft,14
To towers and windows yea to chimney-tops,14
The livelong day with patient expectation,14
And when you saw his chariot but appear,14
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,14
Made in her concave shores?,14
And do you now cull out a holiday?,14
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!,14
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague,14
Go go good countrymen and for this fault,14
Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears,14
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.,14
See whether their basest metal be not moved;,14
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;,14
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.,14
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.,14
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,14
So do you too where you perceive them thick.,14
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,14
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.,14
SCENE II. A public place.,14
Calpurnia!,14
Calpurnia!,14
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,14
Caesar my lord?,14
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,14
Shake off their sterile curse.,14
When Caesar says 'do this' it is perform'd.,14
Flourish,14
Ha! who calls?,14
Who is it in the press that calls on me?,14
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.,14
What man is that?,14
Set him before me; let me see his face.,14
What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.,14
He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.,14
Will you go see the order of the course?,14
I pray you do.,14
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.,14
I'll leave you.,14
I have not from your eyes that gentleness,14
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand,14
Cassius,14
I turn the trouble of my countenance,14
Of late with passions of some difference,14
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;,14
Among which number Cassius be you one--,14
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war,14
Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion;,14
Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations.,14
No Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,14
Tis just:,14
That you have no such mirrors as will turn,14
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,14
Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus,14
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.,14
That you would have me seek into myself,14
Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear:,14
So well as by reflection I your glass,14
That of yourself which you yet know not of.,14
Were I a common laugher or did use,14
To every new protester; if you know,14
And after scandal them or if you know,14
To all the rout then hold me dangerous.,14
What means this shouting? I do fear the people,14
Ay do you fear it?,14
I would not Cassius; yet I love him well.,14
What is it that you would impart to me?,14
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,14
For let the gods so speed me as I love,14
I know that virtue to be in you Brutus,14
Well honour is the subject of my story.,14
Think of this life; but for my single self,14
In awe of such a thing as I myself.,14
We both have fed as well and we can both,14
For once upon a raw and gusty day,14
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou Cassius now,14
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,14
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.,14
With lusty sinews throwing it aside,14
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,14
I as Aeneas our great ancestor,14
The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber,14
Is now become a god and Cassius is,14
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.,14
And when the fit was on him I did mark,14
His coward lips did from their colour fly,14
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:,14
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,14
As a sick girl. Ye gods it doth amaze me,14
So get the start of the majestic world,14
Shout. Flourish,14
I do believe that these applauses are,14
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world,14
Walk under his huge legs and peep about,14
Men at some time are masters of their fates:,14
But in ourselves that we are underlings.,14
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?,14
Sound them it doth become the mouth as well;,14
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.,14
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,14
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!,14
But it was famed with more than with one man?,14
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?,14
When there is in it but one only man.,14
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd,14
As easily as a king.,14
What you would work me to I have some aim:,14
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,14
Be any further moved. What you have said,14
I will with patience hear and find a time,14
Till then my noble friend chew upon this:,14
Than to repute himself a son of Rome,14
Is like to lay upon us.,14
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.,14
As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve;,14
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.,14
I will do so. But look you Cassius,14
And all the rest look like a chidden train:,14
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes,14
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.,14
Antonius!,14
Let me have men about me that are fat;,14
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;,14
Fear him not Caesar; he's not dangerous;,14
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:,14
I do not know the man I should avoid,14
He is a great observer and he looks,14
As thou dost Antony; he hears no music;,14
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit,14
Such men as he be never at heart's ease,14
And therefore are they very dangerous.,14
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.,14
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.,14
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?,14
That Caesar looks so sad.,14
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.,14
offered him he put it by with the back of his hand,14
What was the second noise for?,14
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?,14
Was the crown offered him thrice?,14
time gentler than other and at every putting-by,14
Who offered him the crown?,14
Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca.,14
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark,14
neither 'twas one of these coronets;--and as I told,14
thinking he would fain have had it. Then he,14
but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his,14
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he,14
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps,14
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked,14
for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of,14
But soft I pray you: what did Caesar swound?,14
mouth and was speechless.,14
No Caesar hath it not; but you and I,14
I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure,14
clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and,14
the theatre I am no true man.,14
Marry before he fell down when he perceived the,14
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his,14
occupation if I would not have taken him at a word,14
he fell. When he came to himself again he said,14
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three,14
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but,14
stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.,14
Ay.,14
Ay he spoke Greek.,14
Nay an I tell you that Ill ne'er look you i' the,14
one another and shook their heads; but for mine own,14
news too: Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs,14
well. There was more foolery yet if I could,14
Will you sup with me to-night Casca?,14
Will you dine with me to-morrow?,14
worth the eating.,14
Do so. Farewell both.,14
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!,14
So is he now in execution,14
However he puts on this tardy form.,14
Which gives men stomach to digest his words,14
And so it is. For this time I will leave you:,14
I will come home to you; or if you will,14
I will do so: till then think of the world.,14
Well Brutus thou art noble; yet I see,14
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet,14
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?,14
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,14
In several hands in at his windows throw,14
Writings all tending to the great opinion,14
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:,14
For we will shake him or worse days endure.,14
SCENE III. The same. A street.,14
Good even Casca: brought you Caesar home?,14
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth,14
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds,14
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,14
But never till to-night never till now,14
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,14
Incenses them to send destruction.,14
A common slave--you know him well by sight--,14
Like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand,14
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--,14
Who glared upon me and went surly by,14
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,14
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.,14
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,14
Do so conjointly meet let not men say,14
For I believe they are portentous things,14
Indeed it is a strange-disposed time:,14
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.,14
He doth; for he did bid Antonius,14
Good night then Casca: this disturbed sky,14
Farewell Cicero.,14
Enter CASSIUS,14
A Roman.,14
Your ear is good. Cassius what night is this!,14
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?,14
For my part I have walk'd about the streets,14
And thus unbraced Casca as you see,14
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open,14
Even in the aim and very flash of it.,14
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,14
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.,14
That should be in a Roman you do want,14
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,14
But if you would consider the true cause,14
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,14
Why all these things change from their ordinance,14
To monstrous quality--why you shall find,14
To make them instruments of fear and warning,14
Now could I Casca name to thee a man,14
That thunders lightens opens graves and roars,14
A man no mightier than thyself or me,14
And fearful as these strange eruptions are.,14
Let it be who it is: for Romans now,14
But woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,14
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.,14
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;,14
In every place save here in Italy.,14
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:,14
Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat:,14
Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron,14
But life being weary of these worldly bars,14
If I know this know all the world besides,14
I can shake off at pleasure.,14
So can I:,14
The power to cancel his captivity.,14
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,14
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.,14
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,14
For the base matter to illuminate,14
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this,14
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,14
You speak to Casca and to such a man,14
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,14
As who goes farthest.,14
Now know you Casca I have moved already,14
To undergo with me an enterprise,14
And I do know by this they stay for me,14
There is no stir or walking in the streets;,14
In favour's like the work we have in hand,14
Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste.,14
He is a friend.,14
Cinna where haste you so?,14
No it is Casca; one incorporate,14
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!,14
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.,14
O Cassius if you could,14
Be you content: good Cinna take this paper,14
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this,14
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,14
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?,14
To seek you at your house. Well I will hie,14
That done repair to Pompey's theatre.,14
Come Casca you and I will yet ere day,14
Is ours already and the man entire,14
O he sits high in all the people's hearts:,14
His countenance like richest alchemy,14
Him and his worth and our great need of him,14
For it is after midnight; and ere day,14
Exeunt,14
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.,14
What Lucius ho!,14
Give guess how near to day. Lucius I say!,14
When Lucius when? awake I say! what Lucius!,14
Call'd you my lord?,14
When it is lighted come and call me here.,14
Exit,14
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,14
How that might change his nature there's the question.,14
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--,14
That at his will he may do danger with.,14
Remorse from power: and to speak truth of Caesar,14
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,14
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;,14
He then unto the ladder turns his back,14
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.,14
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,14
Would run to these and these extremities:,14
Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,14
Re-enter LUCIUS,14
Searching the window for a flint I found,14
It did not lie there when I went to bed.,14
Get you to bed again; it is not day.,14
I know not sir.,14
I will sir.,14
The exhalations whizzing in the air,14
Opens the letter and reads,14
Shall Rome  and c. Speak strike redress!,14
Such instigations have been often dropp'd,14
Shall Rome  and c.' Thus must I piece it out:,14
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome,14
Speak strike redress!' Am I entreated,14
If the redress will follow thou receivest,14
Re-enter LUCIUS,14
Knocking within,14
Exit LUCIUS,14
I have not slept.,14
And the first motion all the interim is,14
The Genius and the mortal instruments,14
Like to a little kingdom suffers then,14
Re-enter LUCIUS,14
Who doth desire to see you.,14
No sir there are moe with him.,14
No sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,14
That by no means I may discover them,14
Let 'em enter.,14
They are the faction. O conspiracy,14
When evils are most free? O then by day,14
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none conspiracy;,14
For if thou path thy native semblance on,14
To hide thee from prevention.,14
I think we are too bold upon your rest:,14
I have been up this hour awake all night.,14
Yes every man of them and no man here,14
You had but that opinion of yourself,14
This is Trebonius.,14
This Decius Brutus.,14
This Casca; this Cinna; and this Metellus Cimber.,14
What watchful cares do interpose themselves,14
Shall I entreat a word?,14
Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?,14
O pardon sir it doth; and yon gray lines,14
You shall confess that you are both deceived.,14
Which is a great way growing on the south,14
Some two months hence up higher toward the north,14
Stands as the Capitol directly here.,14
And let us swear our resolution.,14
The sufferance of our souls the time's abuse--,14
And every man hence to his idle bed;,14
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,14
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour,14
What need we any spur but our own cause,14
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word,14
Than honesty to honesty engaged,14
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,14
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear,14
The even virtue of our enterprise,14
To think that or our cause or our performance,14
That every Roman bears and nobly bears,14
If he do break the smallest particle,14
But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?,14
Let us not leave him out.,14
O let us have him for his silver hairs,14
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:,14
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,14
O name him not: let us not break with him;,14
That other men begin.,14
Indeed he is not fit.,14
Decius well urged: I think it is not meet,14
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him,14
If he improve them may well stretch so far,14
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.,14
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,14
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:,14
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;,14
O that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,14
Caesar must bleed for it! And gentle friends,14
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,14
And let our hearts as subtle masters do,14
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make,14
Which so appearing to the common eyes,14
And for Mark Antony think not of him;,14
When Caesar's head is off.,14
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--,14
If he love Caesar all that he can do,14
And that were much he should; for he is given,14
There is no fear in him; let him not die;,14
Clock strikes,14
The clock hath stricken three.,14
But it is doubtful yet,14
For he is superstitious grown of late,14
Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies:,14
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,14
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.,14
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear,14
And bears with glasses elephants with holes,14
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,14
Let me work;,14
And I will bring him to the Capitol.,14
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?,14
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,14
I wonder none of you have thought of him.,14
He loves me well and I have given him reasons;,14
The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you Brutus.,14
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.,14
Let not our looks put on our purposes,14
With untired spirits and formal constancy:,14
Exeunt all but BRUTUS,14
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:,14
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;,14
Enter PORTIA,14
Portia what mean you? wherefore rise you now?,14
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.,14
Stole from my bed: and yesternight at supper,14
Musing and sighing with your arms across,14
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;,14
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;,14
But with an angry wafture of your hand,14
Fearing to strengthen that impatience,14
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,14
It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,14
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,14
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.,14
Brutus is wise and were he not in health,14
Why so I do. Good Portia go to bed.,14
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours,14
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,14
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air,14
You have some sick offence within your mind,14
I ought to know of: and upon my knees,14
By all your vows of love and that great vow,14
That you unfold to me yourself your half,14
Have had to resort to you: for here have been,14
Even from darkness.,14
I should not need if you were gentle Brutus.,14
Is it excepted I should know no secrets,14
But as it were in sort or limitation,14
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs,14
Portia is Brutus' harlot not his wife.,14
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops,14
If this were true then should I know this secret.,14
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:,14
A woman well-reputed Cato's daughter.,14
Being so father'd and so husbanded?,14
I have made strong proof of my constancy,14
Here in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.,14
O ye gods,14
Knocking within,14
And by and by thy bosom shall partake,14
All my engagements I will construe to thee,14
Leave me with haste.,14
Lucius who's that knocks?,14
He is a sick man that would speak with you.,14
Boy stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?,14
O what a time have you chose out brave Caius,14
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand,14
Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius,14
By all the gods that Romans bow before,14
Brave son derived from honourable loins!,14
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,14
Yea get the better of them. What's to do?,14
But are not some whole that we must make sick?,14
I shall unfold to thee as we are going,14
Set on your foot,14
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth,14
Follow me then.,14
SCENE II. CAESAR's house.,14
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:,14
Help ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?,14
My lord?,14
And bring me their opinions of success.,14
Exit,14
What mean you Caesar? think you to walk forth?,14
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me,14
The face of Caesar they are vanished.,14
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,14
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.,14
And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead;,14
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,14
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,14
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.,14
And I do fear them.,14
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?,14
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.,14
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.,14
The valiant never taste of death but once.,14
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;,14
Will come when it will come.,14
What say the augurers?,14
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,14
The gods do this in shame of cowardice:,14
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.,14
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:,14
And I the elder and more terrible:,14
Alas my lord,14
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear,14
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:,14
Let me upon my knee prevail in this.,14
And for thy humour I will stay at home.,14
Here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so.,14
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.,14
To bear my greeting to the senators,14
Cannot is false and that I dare not falser:,14
Say he is sick.,14
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,14
Decius go tell them Caesar will not come.,14
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.,14
That is enough to satisfy the senate.,14
Because I love you I will let you know:,14
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,14
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans,14
And these does she apply for warnings and portents,14
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.,14
It was a vision fair and fortunate:,14
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,14
Reviving blood and that great men shall press,14
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.,14
I have when you have heard what I can say:,14
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.,14
Their minds may change. Besides it were a mock,14
Break up the senate till another time,14
If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper,14
Pardon me Caesar; for my dear dear love,14
And reason to my love is liable.,14
I am ashamed I did yield to them.,14
Enter PUBLIUS BRUTUS LIGARIUS METELLUS CASCA TREBONIUS and CINNA,14
Good morrow Caesar.,14
What Brutus are you stirr'd so early too?,14
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy,14
What is 't o'clock?,14
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.,14
See! Antony that revels long o' nights,14
So to most noble Caesar.,14
I am to blame to be thus waited for.,14
I have an hour's talk in store for you;,14
Be near me that I may remember you.,14
Aside,14
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.,14
And we like friends will straightway go together.,14
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!,14
SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.,14
Caesar beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;,14
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus,14
There is but one mind in all these men and it is,14
look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.,14
ARTEMIDORUS.',14
And as a suitor will I give him this.,14
Out of the teeth of emulation.,14
If not the Fates with traitors do contrive.,14
SCENE IV. Another part of the same street before the house of BRUTUS.,14
I prithee boy run to the senate-house;,14
Why dost thou stay?,14
I would have had thee there and here again,14
O constancy be strong upon my side,14
I have a man's mind but a woman's might.,14
Art thou here yet?,14
Run to the Capitol and nothing else?,14
Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well,14
What Caesar doth what suitors press to him.,14
I hear none madam.,14
I heard a bustling rumour like a fray,14
Sooth madam I hear nothing.,14
Come hither fellow: which way hast thou been?,14
What is't o'clock?,14
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?,14
To see him pass on to the Capitol.,14
That I have lady: if it will please Caesar,14
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.,14
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance.,14
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,14
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:,14
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.,14
I must go in. Ay me how weak a thing,14
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!,14
That Caesar will not grant. O I grow faint.,14
Say I am merry: come to me again,14
Exeunt severally,14
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.,14
[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.,14
Hail Caesar! read this schedule.,14
At your best leisure this his humble suit.,14
That touches Caesar nearer: read it great Caesar.,14
Delay not Caesar; read it instantly.,14
Sirrah give place.,14
Come to the Capitol.,14
I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.,14
Fare you well.,14
What said Popilius Lena?,14
I fear our purpose is discovered.,14
Casca be sudden for we fear prevention.,14
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,14
Cassius be constant:,14
For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change.,14
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.,14
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,14
He is address'd: press near and second him.,14
Are we all ready? What is now amiss,14
Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar,14
An humble heart--,14
I must prevent thee Cimber.,14
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,14
Into the law of children. Be not fond,14
That will be thaw'd from the true quality,14
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.,14
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,14
Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause,14
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,14
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?,14
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may,14
What Brutus!,14
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,14
I could be well moved if I were as you:,14
But I am constant as the northern star,14
There is no fellow in the firmament.,14
They are all fire and every one doth shine,14
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,14
Yet in the number I do know but one,14
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,14
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,14
O Caesar--,14
Great Caesar--,14
Speak hands for me!,14
Et tu Brute! Then fall Caesar.,14
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!,14
Some to the common pulpits and cry out,14
People and senators be not affrighted;,14
Go to the pulpit Brutus.,14
Where's Publius?,14
Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar's,14
Talk not of standing. Publius good cheer;,14
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them Publius.,14
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.,14
But we the doers.,14
Where is Antony?,14
Men wives and children stare cry out and run,14
Fates we will know your pleasures:,14
And drawing days out that men stand upon.,14
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.,14
So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged,14
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood,14
Then walk we forth even to the market-place,14
Let's all cry 'Peace freedom and liberty!',14
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over,14
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,14
No worthier than the dust!,14
So often shall the knot of us be call'd,14
What shall we forth?,14
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels,14
Enter a Servant,14
Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel:,14
And being prostrate thus he bade me say:,14
Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving:,14
Say I fear'd Caesar honour'd him and loved him.,14
May safely come to him and be resolved,14
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead,14
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus,14
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.,14
I never thought him worse.,14
He shall be satisfied; and by my honour,14
I'll fetch him presently.,14
I know that we shall have him well to friend.,14
That fears him much; and my misgiving still,14
But here comes Antony.,14
Welcome Mark Antony.,14
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils,14
I know not gentlemen what you intend,14
If I myself there is no hour so fit,14
Of half that worth as those your swords made rich,14
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard,14
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,14
No place will please me so no mean of death,14
The choice and master spirits of this age.,14
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,14
You see we do yet see you but our hands,14
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;,14
As fire drives out fire so pity pity--,14
To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony:,14
Of brothers' temper do receive you in,14
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's,14
Only be patient till we have appeased,14
And then we will deliver you the cause,14
Have thus proceeded.,14
Let each man render me his bloody hand:,14
Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand;,14
Yours Cinna; and my valiant Casca yours;,14
Gentlemen all--alas what shall I say?,14
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,14
That I did love thee Caesar O 'tis true:,14
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,14
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,14
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,14
It would become me better than to close,14
Pardon me Julius! Here wast thou bay'd brave hart;,14
Sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy lethe.,14
And this indeed O world the heart of thee.,14
Dost thou here lie!,14
Pardon me Caius Cassius:,14
Then in a friend it is cold modesty.,14
But what compact mean you to have with us?,14
Or shall we on and not depend on you?,14
Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.,14
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons,14
Or else were this a savage spectacle:,14
That were you Antony the son of Caesar,14
That's all I seek:,14
Produce his body to the market-place;,14
Speak in the order of his funeral.,14
Brutus a word with you.,14
You know not what you do: do not consent,14
Know you how much the people may be moved,14
By your pardon;,14
And show the reason of our Caesar's death:,14
He speaks by leave and by permission,14
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.,14
I know not what may fall; I like it not.,14
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,14
And say you do't by our permission;,14
About his funeral: and you shall speak,14
After my speech is ended.,14
I do desire no more.,14
Exeunt all but ANTONY,14
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!,14
That ever lived in the tide of times.,14
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy--,14
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--,14
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife,14
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,14
That mothers shall but smile when they behold,14
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:,14
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,14
Cry  'Havoc' and let slip the dogs of war;,14
With carrion men groaning for burial.,14
You serve Octavius Caesar do you not?,14
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.,14
And bid me say to you by word of mouth--,14
Seeing the body,14
Passion I see is catching; for mine eyes,14
Began to water. Is thy master coming?,14
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced:,14
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;,14
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse,14
In my oration how the people take,14
According to the which thou shalt discourse,14
Lend me your hand.,14
SCENE II. The Forum.,14
We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.,14
Cassius go you into the other street,14
Those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here;,14
And public reasons shall be rendered,14
I will hear Brutus speak.,14
When severally we hear them rendered.,14
The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!,14
Romans countrymen and lovers! hear me for my,14
for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that,14
awake your senses that you may the better judge.,14
Caesar's to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar,14
why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer:,14
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and,14
all free men? As Caesar loved me I weep for him;,14
valiant I honour him: but as he was ambitious I,14
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his,14
bondman? If any speak; for him have I offended.,14
any speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so,14
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.,14
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to,14
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not,14
enforced for which he suffered death.,14
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony: who,14
the benefit of his dying a place in the,14
I depart--that as I slew my best lover for the,14
when it shall please my country to need my death.,14
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.,14
Let him be Caesar.,14
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.,14
With shouts and clamours.,14
Peace silence! Brutus speaks.,14
Good countrymen let me depart alone,14
Do grace to Caesar's corpse and grace his speech,14
By our permission is allow'd to make.,14
Save I alone till Antony have spoke.,14
Stay ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.,14
We'll hear him. Noble Antony go up.,14
Goes into the pulpit,14
He says for Brutus' sake,14
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.,14
Nay that's certain:,14
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.,14
Peace ho! let us hear him.,14
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him.,14
The good is oft interred with their bones;,14
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:,14
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.,14
For Brutus is an honourable man;,14
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.,14
But Brutus says he was ambitious;,14
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,14
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?,14
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:,14
And Brutus is an honourable man.,14
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,14
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;,14
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,14
You all did love him once not without cause:,14
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,14
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,14
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.,14
Caesar has had great wrong.,14
I fear there will a worse come in his place.,14
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.,14
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.,14
Now mark him he begins again to speak.,14
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.,14
O masters if I were disposed to stir,14
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,14
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose,14
Than I will wrong such honourable men.,14
I found it in his closet 'tis his will:,14
Which pardon me I do not mean to read--,14
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,14
And dying mention it within their wills,14
Unto their issue.,14
The will the will! we will hear Caesar's will.,14
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.,14
And being men bearing the will of Caesar,14
Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;,14
Read the will; we'll hear it Antony;,14
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?,14
I fear I wrong the honourable men,14
They were traitors: honourable men!,14
They were villains murderers: the will! read the will.,14
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,14
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?,14
Descend.,14
ANTONY comes down,14
Stand from the hearse stand from the body.,14
Nay press not so upon me; stand far off.,14
If you have tears prepare to shed them now.,14
The first time ever Caesar put it on;,14
That day he overcame the Nervii:,14
See what a rent the envious Casca made:,14
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,14
As rushing out of doors to be resolved,14
For Brutus as you know was Caesar's angel:,14
This was the most unkindest cut of all;,14
Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms,14
And in his mantle muffling up his face,14
Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell.,14
Then I and you and all of us fell down,14
O now you weep; and I perceive you feel,14
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold,14
Here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors.,14
O noble Caesar!,14
O traitors villains!,14
We will be revenged.,14
Let not a traitor live!,14
Peace there! hear the noble Antony.,14
Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up,14
They that have done this deed are honourable:,14
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,14
I come not friends to steal away your hearts:,14
But as you know me all a plain blunt man,14
That gave me public leave to speak of him:,14
Action nor utterance nor the power of speech,14
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;,14
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,14
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue,14
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.,14
We'll burn the house of Brutus.,14
Yet hear me countrymen; yet hear me speak.,14
Why friends you go to do you know not what:,14
Alas you know not: I must tell you then:,14
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.,14
To every Roman citizen he gives,14
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.,14
Hear me with patience.,14
Moreover he hath left you all his walks,14
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,14
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.,14
Never never. Come away away!,14
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.,14
Go fetch fire.,14
Pluck down forms windows any thing.,14
Now let it work. Mischief thou art afoot,14
Enter a Servant,14
Sir Octavius is already come to Rome.,14
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.,14
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,14
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius,14
Belike they had some notice of the people,14
Exeunt,14
Enter CINNA the poet,14
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:,14
Yet something leads me forth.,14
What is your name?,14
Where do you dwell?,14
Answer every man directly.,14
Ay and wisely.,14
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I,14
answer every man directly and briefly wisely and,14
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry:,14
Directly I am going to Caesar's funeral.,14
As a friend.,14
For your dwelling--briefly.,14
Your name sir truly.,14
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.,14
Tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses.,14
It is no matter his name's Cinna; pluck but his,14
Tear him tear him! Come brands ho! fire-brands:,14
house and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away go!,14
ACT IV,14
ANTONY OCTAVIUS and LEPIDUS seated at a table,14
Your brother too must die; consent you Lepidus?,14
Prick him down Antony.,14
Who is your sister's son Mark Antony.,14
But Lepidus go you to Caesar's house;,14
How to cut off some charge in legacies.,14
Or here or at the Capitol.,14
This is a slight unmeritable man,14
The three-fold world divided he should stand,14
So you thought him;,14
In our black sentence and proscription.,14
And though we lay these honours on this man,14
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,14
Either led or driven as we point the way;,14
Then take we down his load and turn him off,14
And graze in commons.,14
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.,14
I do appoint him store of provender:,14
To wind to stop to run directly on,14
And in some taste is Lepidus but so;,14
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds,14
Which out of use and staled by other men,14
But as a property. And now Octavius,14
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:,14
Our best friends made our means stretch'd,14
How covert matters may be best disclosed,14
Let us do so: for we are at the stake,14
And some that smile have in their hearts I fear,14
Exeunt,14
Drum. Enter BRUTUS LUCILIUS LUCIUS and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them,14
Give the word ho! and stand.,14
He is at hand; and Pindarus is come,14
He greets me well. Your master Pindarus,14
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish,14
I shall be satisfied.,14
But that my noble master will appear,14
He is not doubted. A word Lucilius;,14
With courtesy and with respect enough;,14
Nor with such free and friendly conference,14
Thou hast described,14
When love begins to sicken and decay,14
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;,14
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;,14
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades,14
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;,14
Are come with Cassius.,14
Low march within,14
Enter CASSIUS and his powers,14
Stand ho! Speak the word along.,14
Stand!,14
Most noble brother you have done me wrong.,14
And if not so how should I wrong a brother?,14
And when you do them--,14
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.,14
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,14
Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs,14
Pindarus,14
A little from this ground.,14
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.,14
Exeunt,14
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS,14
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella,14
Wherein my letters praying on his side,14
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.,14
That every nice offence should bear his comment.,14
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;,14
To undeservers.,14
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,14
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,14
Chastisement!,14
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?,14
And not for justice? What shall one of us,14
But for supporting robbers shall we now,14
And sell the mighty space of our large honours,14
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon,14
Brutus bay not me;,14
To hedge me in; I am a soldier I,14
To make conditions.,14
I am.,14
Urge me no more I shall forget myself;,14
Away slight man!,14
Hear me for I will speak.,14
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?,14
All this! ay more: fret till your proud heart break;,14
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?,14
Under your testy humour? By the gods,14
Though it do split you; for from this day forth,14
When you are waspish.,14
You say you are a better soldier:,14
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,14
You wrong me every way; you wrong me Brutus;,14
Did I say 'better'?,14
When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.,14
I durst not!,14
What durst not tempt him!,14
Do not presume too much upon my love;,14
You have done that you should be sorry for.,14
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,14
Which I respect not. I did send to you,14
For I can raise no money by vile means:,14
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring,14
By any indirection: I did send,14
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?,14
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,14
Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts;,14
I denied you not.,14
I did not: he was but a fool that brought,14
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,14
I do not till you practise them on me.,14
I do not like your faults.,14
A flatterer's would not though they do appear,14
Come Antony and young Octavius come,14
For Cassius is aweary of the world;,14
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,14
To cast into my teeth. O I could weep,14
And here my naked breast; within a heart,14
If that thou be'st a Roman take it forth;,14
Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,14
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.,14
Be angry when you will it shall have scope;,14
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb,14
Who much enforced shows a hasty spark,14
Hath Cassius lived,14
When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?,14
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.,14
O Brutus!,14
Have not you love enough to bear with me,14
Makes me forgetful?,14
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,14
[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;,14
They be alone.,14
[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.,14
How now! what's the matter?,14
Love and be friends as two such men should be;,14
Ha ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!,14
Bear with him Brutus; 'tis his fashion.,14
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?,14
Away away be gone.,14
Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders,14
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you,14
Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS,14
Exit LUCIUS,14
O Cassius I am sick of many griefs.,14
If you give place to accidental evils.,14
Ha! Portia!,14
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?,14
Upon what sickness?,14
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony,14
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,14
And died so?,14
O ye immortal gods!,14
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.,14
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.,14
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.,14
Exit LUCIUS,14
Welcome good Messala.,14
And call in question our necessities.,14
No more I pray you.,14
That young Octavius and Mark Antony,14
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.,14
With what addition?,14
Octavius Antony and Lepidus,14
Therein our letters do not well agree;,14
By their proscriptions Cicero being one.,14
Cicero is dead,14
Had you your letters from your wife my lord?,14
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?,14
That methinks is strange.,14
No my lord.,14
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:,14
Why farewell Portia. We must die Messala:,14
I have the patience to endure it now.,14
I have as much of this in art as you,14
Well to our work alive. What do you think,14
I do not think it good.,14
This it is:,14
So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers,14
Are full of rest defense and nimbleness.,14
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground,14
For they have grudged us contribution:,14
By them shall make a fuller number up,14
From which advantage shall we cut him off,14
These people at our back.,14
Under your pardon. You must note beside,14
Our legions are brim-full our cause is ripe:,14
We at the height are ready to decline.,14
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;,14
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.,14
And we must take the current when it serves,14
Then with your will go on;,14
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,14
Which we will niggard with a little rest.,14
No more. Good night:,14
Lucius!,14
My gown.,14
Farewell good Messala:,14
Good night and good repose.,14
This was an ill beginning of the night:,14
Let it not Brutus.,14
Good night my lord.,14
Good night Lord Brutus.,14
Exeunt all but BRUTUS,14
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?,14
What thou speak'st drowsily?,14
Call Claudius and some other of my men:,14
Varro and Claudius!,14
Calls my lord?,14
It may be I shall raise you by and by,14
So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure.,14
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.,14
I put it in the pocket of my gown.,14
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.,14
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,14
Ay my lord an't please you.,14
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing.,14
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;,14
I have slept my lord already.,14
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,14
Music and a song,14
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,14
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:,14
I'll take it from thee; and good boy good night.,14
Where I left reading? Here it is I think.,14
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?,14
That shapes this monstrous apparition.,14
Art thou some god some angel or some devil,14
Speak to me what thou art.,14
Why comest thou?,14
Well; then I shall see thee again?,14
Why I will see thee at Philippi then.,14
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:,14
Boy Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs awake! Claudius!,14
He thinks he still is at his instrument.,14
My lord?,14
My lord I do not know that I did cry.,14
Nothing my lord.,14
To VARRO,14
My lord?,14
Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep?,14
Ay: saw you any thing?,14
Nor I my lord.,14
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,14
It shall be done my lord.,14
ACT V,14
Enter OCTAVIUS ANTONY and their army,14
You said the enemy would not come down,14
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;,14
Answering before we do demand of them.,14
Wherefore they do it: they could be content,14
With fearful bravery thinking by this face,14
But 'tis not so.,14
Prepare you generals:,14
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,14
Octavius lead your battle softly on,14
Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.,14
I do not cross you; but I will do so.,14
Drum. Enter BRUTUS CASSIUS and their Army; LUCILIUS TITINIUS MESSALA and others,14
Stand fast Titinius: we must out and talk.,14
No Caesar we will answer on their charge.,14
Stir not until the signal.,14
Not that we love words better as you do.,14
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words:,14
Crying 'Long live! hail Caesar!',14
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;,14
And leave them honeyless.,14
O yes and soundless too;,14
And very wisely threat before you sting.,14
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:,14
And bow'd like bondmen kissing Caesar's feet;,14
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!,14
This tongue had not offended so to-day,14
Come come the cause: if arguing make us sweat,14
I draw a sword against conspirators;,14
Never till Caesar's three and thirty wounds,14
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.,14
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.,14
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.,14
Young man thou couldst not die more honourable.,14
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!,14
Come Antony away!,14
If you dare fight to-day come to the field;,14
Exeunt OCTAVIUS ANTONY and their army,14
The storm is up and all is on the hazard.,14
[Standing forth] My lord?,14
Messala!,14
Messala,14
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand Messala:,14
As Pompey was am I compell'd to set,14
You know that I held Epicurus strong,14
And partly credit things that do presage.,14
Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd,14
Who to Philippi here consorted us:,14
And in their steads do ravens crows and kites,14
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem,14
Our army lies ready to give up the ghost.,14
I but believe it partly;,14
To meet all perils very constantly.,14
Now most noble Brutus,14
Lovers in peace lead on our days to age!,14
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.,14
The very last time we shall speak together:,14
Even by the rule of that philosophy,14
Which he did give himself I know not how,14
For fear of what might fall so to prevent,14
To stay the providence of some high powers,14
Then if we lose this battle,14
Thorough the streets of Rome?,14
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;,14
Must end that work the ides of March begun;,14
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:,14
If we do meet again why we shall smile;,14
For ever and for ever farewell Brutus!,14
If not 'tis true this parting was well made.,14
The end of this day's business ere it come!,14
And then the end is known. Come ho! away!,14
SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.,14
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills,14
Loud alarum,14
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,14
Ride ride Messala: let them all come down.,14
SCENE III. Another part of the field.,14
O look Titinius look the villains fly!,14
This ensign here of mine was turning back;,14
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early;,14
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,14
Enter PINDARUS,14
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord,14
This hill is far enough. Look look Titinius;,14
They are my lord.,14
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,14
And here again; that I may rest assured,14
I will be here again even with a thought.,14
Go Pindarus get higher on that hill;,14
And tell me what thou notest about the field.,14
This day I breathed first: time is come round,14
My life is run his compass. Sirrah what news?,14
What news?,14
With horsemen that make to him on the spur;,14
Now Titinius! Now some light. O he lights too.,14
Shout,14
Come down behold no more.,14
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!,14
Come hither sirrah:,14
And then I swore thee saving of thy life,14
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now keep thine oath;,14
That ran through Caesar's bowels search this bosom.,14
And when my face is cover'd as 'tis now,14
PINDARUS stabs him,14
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.,14
So I am free; yet would not so have been,14
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,14
Exit,14
It is but change Titinius; for Octavius,14
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.,14
Where did you leave him?,14
With Pindarus his bondman on this hill.,14
He lies not like the living. O my heart!,14
No this was he Messala,14
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,14
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;,14
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.,14
O hateful error melancholy's child,14
The things that are not? O error soon conceived,14
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!,14
Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet,14
Into his ears; I may say thrusting it;,14
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus,14
Hie you Messala,14
Exit MESSALA,14
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they,14
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?,14
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow;,14
Will do his bidding. Brutus come apace,14
By your leave gods:--this is a Roman's part,14
Kills himself,14
Where where Messala doth his body lie?,14
Titinius' face is upward.,14
O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet!,14
In our own proper entrails.,14
Brave Titinius!,14
Are yet two Romans living such as these?,14
It is impossible that ever Rome,14
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.,14
Come therefore and to Thasos send his body:,14
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius come;,14
Labeo and Flavius set our battles on:,14
We shall try fortune in a second fight.,14
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.,14
Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads!,14
I will proclaim my name about the field:,14
A foe to tyrants and my country's friend;,14
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I;,14
Exit,14
Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;,14
Yield or thou diest.,14
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;,14
Kill Brutus and be honour'd in his death.,14
Room ho! Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.,14
Enter ANTONY,14
Where is he?,14
I dare assure thee that no enemy,14
The gods defend him from so great a shame!,14
He will be found like Brutus like himself.,14
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;,14
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,14
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent,14
Exeunt,14
Enter BRUTUS DARDANIUS CLITUS STRATO and VOLUMNIUS,14
Statilius show'd the torch-light but my lord,14
Sit thee down Clitus: slaying is the word;,14
Whispers,14
Peace then! no words.,14
Hark thee Dardanius.,14
Shall I do such a deed?,14
O Clitus!,14
To kill him Clitus. Look he meditates.,14
That it runs over even at his eyes.,14
What says my lord?,14
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me,14
And this last night here in Philippi fields:,14
Not so my lord.,14
Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes;,14
Low alarums,14
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,14
Even for that our love of old I prithee,14
That's not an office for a friend my lord.,14
Fly fly my lord; there is no tarrying here.,14
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep;,14
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life,14
I shall have glory by this losing day,14
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.,14
Hath almost ended his life's history:,14
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.,14
Fly my lord fly.,14
Exeunt CLITUS DARDANIUS and VOLUMNIUS,14
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;,14
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face,14
Give me your hand first. Fare you well my lord.,14
Runs on his sword,14
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.,14
Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS ANTONY MESSALA LUCILIUS and the army,14
My master's man. Strato where is thy master?,14
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;,14
And no man else hath honour by his death.,14
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.,14
Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me?,14
Do so good Messala.,14
I held the sword and he did run on it.,14
That did the latest service to my master.,14
All the conspirators save only he,14
He only in a general honest thought,14
His life was gentle and the elements,14
And say to all the world 'This was a man!',14
With all respect and rites of burial.,14
Most like a soldier order'd honourably.,14
To part the glories of this happy day.,14
ACT I,15
Enter KENT GLOUCESTER and EDMUND,15
Albany than Cornwall.,15
division of the kingdom it appears not which of,15
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice,15
Is not this your son my lord?,15
so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am,15
I cannot conceive you.,15
she grew round-wombed and had indeed sir a son,15
Do you smell a fault?,15
being so proper.,15
elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account:,15
world before he was sent for yet was his mother,15
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this,15
No my lord.,15
honourable friend.,15
I must love you and sue to know you better.,15
He hath been out nine years and away he shall,15
Sennet. Enter KING LEAR CORNWALL ALBANY GONERIL REGAN CORDELIA and Attendants,15
I shall my liege.,15
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.,15
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent,15
Conferring them on younger strengths while we,15
And you our no less loving son of Albany,15
Our daughters' several dowers that future strife,15
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,15
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me my daughters--,15
Interest of territory cares of state--,15
That we our largest bounty may extend,15
Our eldest-born speak first.,15
Dearer than eye-sight space and liberty;,15
No less than life with grace health beauty honour;,15
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;,15
[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?,15
Of all these bounds even from this line to this,15
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,15
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,15
Sir I am made,15
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,15
Only she comes too short: that I profess,15
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;,15
In your dear highness' love.,15
And yet not so; since I am sure my love's,15
To thee and thine hereditary ever,15
No less in space validity and pleasure,15
Although the last not least; to whose young love,15
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw,15
Nothing my lord.,15
Nothing.,15
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave,15
According to my bond; nor more nor less.,15
Lest it may mar your fortunes.,15
You have begot me bred me loved me: I,15
Obey you love you and most honour you.,15
They love you all? Haply when I shall wed,15
Half my love with him half my care and duty:,15
To love my father all.,15
Ay good my lord.,15
So young my lord and true.,15
For by the sacred radiance of the sun,15
By all the operation of the orbs,15
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,15
And as a stranger to my heart and me,15
Or he that makes his generation messes,15
Be as well neighbour'd pitied and relieved,15
Good my liege--,15
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.,15
On her kind nursery. Hence and avoid my sight!,15
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?,15
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:,15
I do invest you jointly with my power,15
That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,15
By you to be sustain'd shall our abode,15
The name and all the additions to a king;,15
Beloved sons be yours: which to confirm,15
Giving the crown,15
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,15
As my great patron thought on in my prayers--,15
Let it fall rather though the fork invade,15
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do old man?,15
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,15
And in thy best consideration cheque,15
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;,15
Reverbs no hollowness.,15
My life I never held but as a pawn,15
Thy safety being the motive.,15
See better Lear; and let me still remain,15
Now by Apollo--,15
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.,15
Laying his hand on his sword,15
Do:,15
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;,15
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.,15
On thine allegiance hear me!,15
Which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride,15
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,15
Five days we do allot thee for provision,15
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back,15
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,15
This shall not be revoked.,15
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here.,15
The gods to their dear shelter take thee maid,15
To REGAN and GONERIL,15
That good effects may spring from words of love.,15
He'll shape his old course in a country new.,15
Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER with KING OF FRANCE BURGUNDY and Attendants,15
My lord of Burgundy.,15
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what in the least,15
Or cease your quest of love?,15
I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,15
Right noble Burgundy,15
But now her price is fall'n. Sir there she stands:,15
Or all of it with our displeasure pieced,15
She's there and she is yours.,15
Will you with those infirmities she owes,15
Dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath,15
Pardon me royal sir;,15
Then leave her sir; for by the power that made me,15
To KING OF FRANCE,15
I would not from your love make such a stray,15
To avert your liking a more worthier way,15
Almost to acknowledge hers.,15
That she that even but now was your best object,15
Most best most dearest should in this trice of time,15
So many folds of favour. Sure her offence,15
That monsters it or your fore-vouch'd affection,15
Must be a faith that reason without miracle,15
I yet beseech your majesty--,15
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,15
It is no vicious blot murder or foulness,15
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;,15
A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue,15
Hath lost me in your liking.,15
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.,15
Which often leaves the history unspoke,15
What say you to the lady? Love's not love,15
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?,15
Royal Lear,15
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,15
Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.,15
That you must lose a husband.,15
Since that respects of fortune are his love,15
Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor;,15
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:,15
Gods gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect,15
Thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance,15
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy,15
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind:,15
Thou hast her France: let her be thine; for we,15
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone,15
Come noble Burgundy.,15
Bid farewell to your sisters.,15
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;,15
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:,15
But yet alas stood I within his grace,15
So farewell to you both.,15
Let your study,15
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,15
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:,15
Well may you prosper!,15
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA,15
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our,15
That's most certain and with you; next month with us.,15
observation we have made of it hath not been,15
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off,15
Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever,15
The best and soundest of his time hath been but,15
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed,15
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.,15
him as this of Kent's banishment.,15
between France and him. Pray you let's hit,15
such dispositions as he bears this last,15
We shall further think on't.,15
Exeunt,15
Enter EDMUND with a letter,15
My services are bound. Wherefore should I,15
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,15
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?,15
My mind as generous and my shape as true,15
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base base?,15
More composition and fierce quality,15
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,15
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land:,15
As to the legitimate: fine word--legitimate!,15
And my invention thrive Edmund the base,15
Now gods stand up for bastards!,15
Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!,15
Confined to exhibition! All this done,15
So please your lordship none.,15
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?,15
What paper were you reading?,15
No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of,15
not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,15
I beseech you sir pardon me: it is a letter,15
and for so much as I have perused I find it not,15
Give me the letter sir.,15
contents as in part I understand them are to blame.,15
I hope for my brother's justification he wrote,15
[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes,15
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish,15
in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways not,15
me that of this I may speak more. If our father,15
revenue for ever and live the beloved of your,15
Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him--you,15
Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain,15
brought it?,15
cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the,15
You know the character to be your brother's?,15
it were his; but in respect of that I would,15
It is his.,15

This is the excellent foppery of the world that,15

Spake you with him?,15
Parted you in good terms? Found you no,15
None at all.,15

Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?,15
By day and night he wrongs me; every hour,15
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:,15
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,15
If you come slack of former services,15
He's coming madam; I hear him.,15

If he dislike it let him to our sister,15
Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,15

Speak less than thou knowest,15
Ride more than thou goest,15

No faith lords and great men will not let me; if,15
and ladies too they will not let me have all fool,15
nuncle and I'll give thee two crowns.,15
Why after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat,15
clovest thy crown i' the middle and gavest away,15
the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,15
like myself in this let him be whipped that first,15
Singing,15
For wise men are grown foppish,15
Their manners are so apish.,15
I have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy,15

Prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach,15
An you lie sirrah we'll have you whipped.,15
they'll have me whipped for speaking true thou'lt,15

That you protect this course and put it on,15
Would not 'scape censure nor the redresses sleep,15
Might in their working do you that offence,15
Will call discreet proceeding.,15

This admiration sir is much o' the savour,15
To understand my purposes aright:,15
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;,15
That this our court infected with their manners,15
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel,15
For instant remedy: be then desired,15
A little to disquantity your train;,15

To make this creature fruitful!,15
Dry up in her the organs of increase;,15
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,15
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!,15
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;,15
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel,15
To have a thankless child! Away away!,15

But let his disposition have that scope,15
Re-enter KING LEAR,15

Safer than trust too far:,15
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.,15
If she sustain him and his hundred knights,15

Take you some company and away to horse:,15
And thereto add such reasons of your own,15
And hasten your return.,15

No.,15

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?,15
Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.,15
Why to put his head in; not to give it away to his,15
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my,15
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the,15
Because they are not eight?,15

Enter EDGAR,15
Intelligence is given where you are hid;,15

And Regan with him: have you nothing said,15
Advise yourself.,15

Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.,15
Fly brother. Torches torches! So farewell.,15
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.,15
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards,15
Stop stop! No help?,15

Mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon,15
But where is he?,15
Where is the villain Edmund?,15
Pursue him ho! Go after.,15
By no means what?,15
But that I told him the revenging gods,15
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond,15
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood,15
With his prepared sword he charges home,15
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,15
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,15
Let him fly far:,15
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,15
By his authority I will proclaim it,15
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;,15
When I dissuaded him from his intent,15
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,15
If I would stand against thee would the reposal,15
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny--,15
My very character--I'ld turn it all,15
And thou must make a dullard of the world,15

Yes madam he was of that consort.,15
Tis they have put him on the old man's death,15

That if they come to sojourn at my house,15
Nor I assure thee Regan.,15
A child-like office.,15
He did bewray his practise; and received,15
Is he pursued?,15
If he be taken he shall never more,15
How in my strength you please. For you Edmund,15

hundred-pound filthy worsted-stocking knave; a,15
glass-gazing super-serviceable finical rogue;,15
bawd in way of good service and art nothing but,15
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I,15

Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My,15

Peace sirrah!,15
Yes sir; but anger hath a privilege.,15
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,15
Like rats oft bite the holy cords a-twain,15
That in the natures of their lords rebel;,15
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks,15
Knowing nought like dogs but following.,15

Sir 'tis my occupation to be plain:,15
Than stands on any shoulder that I see,15
This is some fellow,15
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb,15
An honest mind and plain he must speak truth!,15
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness,15
Than twenty silly ducking observants,15
Sir in good sooth in sincere verity,15
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire,15
What mean'st by this?,15

And in the fleshment of this dread exploit,15
None of these rogues and cowards,15

Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;,15
You shall do small respect show too bold malice,15
Stocking his messenger.,15

Why madam if I were your father's dog,15
Sir being his knave I will.,15
Our sister speaks of. Come bring away the stocks!,15
Let me beseech your grace not to do so:,15
Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction,15
For pilferings and most common trespasses,15
That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,15
I'll answer that.,15
To have her gentleman abused assaulted,15
KENT is put in the stocks,15
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT,15

I will preserve myself: and am bethought,15
That ever penury in contempt of man,15
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;,15
The winds and persecutions of the sky.,15
Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices,15
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary;,15
Poor pelting villages sheep-cotes and mills,15
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!,15
Exit,15
Enter KING LEAR Fool and Gentleman,15
And not send back my messenger.,15
The night before there was no purpose in them,15
Hail to thee noble master!,15
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?,15

I say yea.,15
Yes they have.,15
By Juno I swear ay.,15
They could not would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,15
Resolve me with all modest haste which way,15
Coming from us.,15
I did commend your highness' letters to them,15
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post,15
From Goneril his mistress salutations;,15
Which presently they read: on whose contents,15
Commanded me to follow and attend,15
And meeting here the other messenger,15
Being the very fellow that of late,15
Having more man than wit about me drew:,15
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth,15
Winter's not gone yet if the wild-geese fly that way.,15
Do make their children blind;,15
Shall see their children kind.,15
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.,15

Hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow,15
With the earl sir here within.,15
Stay here.,15
Made you no more offence but what you speak of?,15
How chance the king comes with so small a train?,15
question thou hadst well deserved it.,15
We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee,15
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and,15
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel,15
following it: but the great one that goes up the,15
gives thee better counsel give me mine again: I,15
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,15
Will pack when it begins to rain,15
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,15
The knave turns fool that runs away;,15
Where learned you this fool?,15
Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER,15
They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;,15
Fetch me a better answer.,15
You know the fiery quality of the duke;,15
In his own course.,15
Fiery? what quality? Why Gloucester Gloucester,15
Well my good lord I have inform'd them so.,15
Ay my good lord.,15
Would with his daughter speak commands her service:,15
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--,15
Infirmity doth still neglect all office,15
When nature being oppress'd commands the mind,15
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,15
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore,15
Should he sit here? This act persuades me,15
Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.,15
Now presently: bid them come forth and hear me,15
Till it cry sleep to death.,15
Exit,15
Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels,15
o' the coxcombs with a stick and cried 'Down,15
kindness to his horse buttered his hay.,15
Good morrow to you both.,15
KENT is set at liberty,15
Regan I think you are; I know what reason,15
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,15
To KENT,15
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,15
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness like a vulture here:,15
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe,15
I pray you sir take patience: I have hope.,15
Than she to scant her duty.,15
I cannot think my sister in the least,15
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,15
As clears her from all blame.,15
O sir you are old.,15
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led,15
Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you,15
Say you have wrong'd her sir.,15
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:,15
Kneeling,15
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food.',15
Return you to my sister.,15
She hath abated me of half my train;,15
Most serpent-like upon the very heart:,15
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,15
Fie sir fie!,15
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,15
To fall and blast her pride!,15
When the rash mood is on.,15
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give,15
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee,15
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes,15
Against my coming in: thou better know'st,15
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude;,15
Wherein I thee endow'd.,15
Who put my man i' the stocks?,15
What trumpet's that?,15
That she would soon be here.,15
Is your lady come?,15
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.,15
What means your grace?,15
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,15
If you do love old men if your sweet sway,15
Make it your cause; send down and take my part!,15
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?,15
Why not by the hand sir? How have I offended?,15
And dotage terms so.,15
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?,15
Deserved much less advancement.,15
I pray you father being weak seem so.,15
You will return and sojourn with my sister,15
I am now from home and out of that provision,15
Return to her and fifty men dismiss'd?,15
To wage against the enmity o' the air;,15
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?,15
Our youngest born I could as well be brought,15
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?,15
To this detested groom.,15
At your choice sir.,15
I will not trouble thee my child; farewell:,15
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter;,15
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,15
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;,15
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,15
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:,15
I and my hundred knights.,15
I look'd not for you yet nor am provided,15
For those that mingle reason with your passion,15
But she knows what she does.,15
I dare avouch it sir: what fifty followers?,15
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger,15
Should many people under two commands,15
Why might not you my lord receive attendance,15
Why not my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,15
For now I spy a danger--I entreat you,15
Will I give place or notice.,15
And in good time you gave it.,15
But kept a reservation to be follow'd,15
With five and twenty Regan? said you so?,15
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,15
Stands in some rank of praise.,15
I'll go with thee:,15
And thou art twice her love.,15
What need you five and twenty ten or five,15
Have a command to tend you?,15
O reason not the need: our basest beggars,15
Allow not nature more than nature needs,15
If only to go warm were gorgeous,15
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But for true need--,15
You see me here you gods a poor old man,15
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts,15
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,15
Stain my man's cheeks! No you unnatural hags,15
That all the world shall--I will do such things--,15
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep,15
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart,15
Or ere I'll weep. O fool I shall go mad!,15
Storm and tempest,15
This house is little: the old man and his people,15
Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,15
For his particular I'll receive him gladly,15
So am I purposed.,15
Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.,15
The king is in high rage.,15
He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.,15
My lord entreat him by no means to stay.,15
Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout,15
O sir to wilful men,15
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:,15
And what they may incense him to being apt,15
Shut up your doors my lord; 'tis a wild night:,15
Exeunt,15
SCENE I. A heath.,15
Who's there besides foul weather?,15
I know you. Where's the king?,15
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,15
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,15
Catch in their fury and make nothing of;,15
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.,15
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf,15
And bids what will take all.,15
None but the fool; who labours to out-jest,15
Sir I do know you;,15
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,15
With mutual cunning 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;,15
Throned and set high?--servants who seem no less,15
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,15
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne,15
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;,15
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,15
In some of our best ports and are at point,15
If on my credit you dare build so far,15
Some that will thank you making just report,15
The king hath cause to plain.,15
And from some knowledge and assurance offer,15
I will talk further with you.,15
For confirmation that I am much more,15
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia--,15
And she will tell you who your fellow is,15
I will go seek the king.,15
Few words but to effect more than all yet;,15
That way I'll this--he that first lights on him,15
Exeunt severally,15
Enter KING LEAR and Fool,15
You cataracts and hurricanoes spout,15
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,15
Singe my white head! And thou all-shaking thunder,15
Crack nature's moulds an germens spill at once,15
O nuncle court holy-water in a dry,15
Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters' blessing:,15
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit fire! spout rain!,15
I tax not you you elements with unkindness;,15
You owe me no subscription: then let fall,15
A poor infirm weak and despised old man:,15
That have with two pernicious daughters join'd,15
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!,15

Before the head has any,15
So beggars marry many.,15
What he his heart should make,15
And turn his sleep to wake.,15
mouths in a glass.,15
I will say nothing.,15
Who's there?,15
man and a fool.,15
Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies,15
And make them keep their caves: since I was man,15
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never,15
The affliction nor the fear.,15
That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,15
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,15
Thou perjured and thou simular man of virtue,15
That under covert and convenient seeming,15
Rive your concealing continents and cry,15
More sinn'd against than sinning.,15
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel;,15
Repose you there; while I to this hard house--,15
Which even but now demanding after you,15
Their scanted courtesy.,15
Come on my boy: how dost my boy? art cold?,15
The art of our necessities is strange,15
your hovel.,15
That's sorry yet for thee.,15
He that has and a little tiny wit--,15
Must make content with his fortunes fit,15
True my good boy. Come bring us to this hovel.,15
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.,15
When priests are more in word than matter;,15
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;,15
When every case in law is right;,15
When slanders do not live in tongues;,15
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;,15
Then shall the realm of Albion,15
Then comes the time who lives to see't,15
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.,15
SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.,15
Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural,15
pity him they took from me the use of mine own,15
displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for,15
Most savage and unnatural!,15
the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have,15
spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:,15
home; there's part of a power already footed: we,15
privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with,15
if he ask for me. I am ill and gone to bed.,15

Storm still,15
Good my lord enter here.,15
I had rather break mine own. Good my lord enter.,15
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;,15
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;,15
Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the,15
The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind,15
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!,15
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:,15
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.,15
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all--,15
No more of that.,15
Prithee go in thyself: seek thine own ease:,15
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.,15
In boy; go first. You houseless poverty--,15
Fool goes in,15
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,15
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness defend you,15
Too little care of this! Take physic pomp;,15
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,15
[Within]  Fathom and half fathom and half! Poor Tom!,15

Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?,15
Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul,15
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;,15
in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film,15
four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a,15

Storm still,15
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?,15
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air,15
He hath no daughters sir.,15
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.,15
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?,15
Those pelican daughters.,15
Halloo halloo loo loo!,15
Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;,15
man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud,15
What hast thou been?,15
my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of,15
her; swore as many oaths as I spake words and,15
slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it:,15
out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart light of,15
wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey.,15
silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot,15
from lenders' books and defy the foul fiend.,15
Says suum mun ha no nonny.,15
Storm still,15

owest the worm no silk the beast no hide the sheep,15

Tearing off his clothes,15

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins,15

poor creature of earth.,15
He met the night-mare and her nine-fold;,15
And her troth plight,15
How fares your grace?,15
Who's there? What is't you seek?,15
Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog the toad,15
the fury of his heart when the foul fiend rages,15

tithing and stock- punished and imprisoned; who,15
body horse to ride and weapon to wear;,15
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.,15
What hath your grace no better company?,15
Modo he's call'd and Mahu.,15
That it doth hate what gets it.,15
Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer,15
Though their injunction be to bar my doors,15
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,15
First let me talk with this philosopher.,15
Good my lord take his offer; go into the house.,15
What is your study?,15
Let me ask you one word in private.,15
His wits begin to unsettle.,15
Storm still,15
He said it would be thus poor banish'd man!,15
I am almost mad myself: I had a son,15
But lately very late: I loved him friend;,15
The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!,15
O cry your mercy sir.,15
Tom's a-cold.,15
Come let's in all.,15

Look where he stands and glares!,15
Come o'er the bourn Bessy to me--,15

Thou robed man of justice take thy place;,15

You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?,15
Be simple answerer for we know the truth.,15
Late footed in the kingdom?,15
I have a letter guessingly set down,15
And not from one opposed.,15
And false.,15
To Dover.,15
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.,15
Wherefore to Dover sir?,15
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister,15
The sea with such a storm as his bare head,15
And quench'd the stelled fires:,15
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,15
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see,15
See't shalt thou never. Fellows hold the chair.,15
He that will think to live till he be old,15
One side will mock another; the other too.,15
Hold your hand my lord:,15
But better service have I never done you,15
How now you dog!,15
I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?,15
They draw and fight,15
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!,15
O I am slain! My lord you have one eye left,15
Dies,15
Where is thy lustre now?,15

That made the overture of thy treasons to us;,15
O my follies! then Edgar was abused.,15
Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell,15
Exit one with GLOUCESTER,15
I have received a hurt: follow me lady.,15
Upon the dunghill. Regan I bleed apace:,15
Exit CORNWALL led by REGAN,15
If this man come to good.,15

Let's follow the old earl and get the Bedlam,15
Allows itself to any thing.,15
To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!,15

Enter GLOUCESTER led by an Old Man,15
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,15
O my good lord I have been your tenant and,15
Away get thee away; good friend be gone:,15
Thee they may hurt.,15
I have no way and therefore want no eyes;,15
Our means secure us and our mere defects,15
The food of thy abused father's wrath!,15

Fellow where goest?,15
Madman and beggar too.,15
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;,15
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind,15
more since.,15
They kill us for their sport.,15
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,15
Is that the naked fellow?,15
Then prithee get thee gone: if for my sake,15
I' the way toward Dover do it for ancient love;,15
Who I'll entreat to lead me.,15
Tis the times' plague when madmen lead the blind.,15
Above the rest be gone.,15
Come on't what will.,15
Sirrah naked fellow--,15
Aside,15
Come hither fellow.,15
Know'st thou the way to Dover?,15
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless,15
fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust as,15
stealing; Modo of murder; Flibbertigibbet of,15
and waiting-women. So bless thee master!,15
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched,15
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,15
Because he doth not feel feel your power quickly;,15
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?,15
There is a cliff whose high and bending head,15
Bring me but to the very brim of it,15
With something rich about me: from that place,15
Give me thy arm:,15
Exeunt,15
Enter GONERIL and EDMUND,15
Not met us on the way.,15
Now where's your master'?,15
I told him of the army that was landed;,15
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,15
When I inform'd him then he call'd me sot,15
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;,15
[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.,15
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs,15
May prove effects. Back Edmund to my brother;,15
I must change arms at home and give the distaff,15
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,15
A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;,15
Decline your head: this kiss if it durst speak,15
Conceive and fare thee well.,15
My most dear Gloucester!,15
O the difference of man and man!,15
My fool usurps my body.,15
Exit,15
I have been worth the whistle.,15
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind,15
That nature which contemns its origin,15
She that herself will sliver and disbranch,15
And come to deadly use.,15
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:,15
Tigers not daughters what have you perform'd?,15
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,15
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?,15
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits,15
It will come,15
Like monsters of the deep.,15
That bear'st a cheek for blows a head for wrongs;,15
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st,15
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?,15
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;,15
Alack why does he so?',15
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend,15
O vain fool!,15
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness,15
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear,15
A woman's shape doth shield thee.,15
Enter a Messenger,15
O my good lord the Duke of Cornwall's dead:,15
The other eye of Gloucester.,15
A servant that he bred thrill'd with remorse,15
To his great master; who thereat enraged,15
But not without that harmful stroke which since,15
This shows you are above,15
So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!,15
Both both my lord.,15
Tis from your sister.,15
But being widow and my Gloucester with her,15
Upon my hateful life: another way,15
Exit,15
Come with my lady hither.,15
No my good lord; I met him back again.,15
Ay my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;,15
Might have the freer course.,15
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,15
Tell me what more thou know'st.,15
SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.,15
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back,15
Something he left imperfect in the,15
of; which imports to the kingdom so much,15
most required and necessary.,15
The Marshal of France Monsieur La Far.,15
demonstration of grief?,15
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down,15
Over her passion; who most rebel-like,15
O then it moved her.,15
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen,15
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,15
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,15
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,15
Made she no verbal question?,15
Pantingly forth as if it press'd her heart:,15
Kent! father! sisters! What i' the storm? i' the night?,15
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,15
To deal with grief alone.,15
The stars above us govern our conditions;,15
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?,15
Was this before the king return'd?,15
Well sir the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;,15
What we are come about and by no means,15
Why good sir?,15
That stripp'd her from his benediction turn'd her,15
To his dog-hearted daughters these things sting,15
Detains him from Cordelia.,15
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?,15
Well sir I'll bring you to our master Lear,15
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;,15
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go,15
Exeunt,15
Enter with drum and colours CORDELIA Doctor and Soldiers,15
As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;,15
With bur-docks hemlock nettles cuckoo-flowers,15
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;,15
And bring him to our eye.,15
What can man's wisdom,15
He that helps him take all my outward worth.,15
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,15
Are many simples operative whose power,15
All blest secrets,15
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate,15
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life,15
Enter a Messenger,15
The British powers are marching hitherward.,15
In expectation of them. O dear father,15
Therefore great France,15
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,15
Soon may I hear and see him!,15
SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.,15
But are my brother's powers set forth?,15
Himself in person there?,15
Your sister is the better soldier.,15
No madam.,15
I know not lady.,15
It was great ignorance Gloucester's eyes being out,15
All hearts against us: Edmund I think is gone,15
His nighted life: moreover to descry,15
I must needs after him madam with my letter.,15
The ways are dangerous.,15
My lady charged my duty in this business.,15
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,15
Let me unseal the letter.,15
I know your lady does not love her husband;,15
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks,15
I madam?,15
Therefore I do advise you take this note:,15
And more convenient is he for my hand,15
If you do find him pray you give him this;,15
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.,15
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,15
Would I could meet him madam! I should show,15
Fare thee well.,15
SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.,15
When shall we come to the top of that same hill?,15
Methinks the ground is even.,15
Hark do you hear the sea?,15
Why then your other senses grow imperfect,15
So may it be indeed:,15
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.,15
But in my garments.,15
Come on sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful,15
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air,15
Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade!,15
The fishermen that walk upon the beach,15
Diminish'd to her cock; her cock a buoy,15
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,15
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight,15
Set me where you stand.,15
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon,15
Let go my hand.,15
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods,15
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going.,15
With all my heart.,15
Is done to cure it.,15
This world I do renounce and in your sights,15
If I could bear it longer and not fall,15
My snuff and loathed part of nature should,15
Now fellow fare thee well.,15
Gone sir: farewell.,15
The treasury of life when life itself,15
By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?,15
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.,15
Away and let me die.,15
So many fathom down precipitating,15
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.,15
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:,15
But have I fall'n or no?,15
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far,15
Alack I have no eyes.,15
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,15
And frustrate his proud will.,15
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.,15
This is above all strangeness.,15
Which parted from you?,15
As I stood here below methought his eyes,15
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:,15
Think that the clearest gods who make them honours,15
I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear,15
Enough enough' and die. That thing you speak of,15
The fiend the fiend:' he led me to that place.,15
Enter KING LEAR fantastically dressed with wild flowers,15
His master thus.,15
king himself.,15
Nature's above art in that respect. There's your,15
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,15
cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove,15
flown bird! i' the clout i' the clout: hewgh!,15
Sweet marjoram.,15
I know that voice.,15
me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my,15
and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no',15
wet me once and the wind to make me chatter; when,15
found 'em there I smelt 'em out. Go to they are,15
thing; 'tis a lie I am not ague-proof.,15
Is 't not the king?,15
When I do stare see how the subject quakes.,15
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:,15
Does lecher in my sight.,15
Was kinder to his father than my daughters,15
To 't luxury pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.,15
Whose face between her forks presages snow;,15
To hear of pleasure's name;,15
With a more riotous appetite.,15
Though women all above:,15
Beneath is all the fiends';,15
sulphurous pit,15
fie fie! pah pah! Give me an ounce of civet,15
there's money for thee.,15
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.,15
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?,15
at me? No do thy worst blind Cupid! I'll not,15
penning of it.,15
I would not take this from report; it is,15
Read.,15
O ho are you there with me? No eyes in your,15
a heavy case your purse in a light; yet you see how,15
I see it feelingly.,15
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond,15
thine ear: change places; and handy-dandy which,15
a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?,15
And the creature run from the cur? There thou,15
dog's obeyed in office.,15
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;,15
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.,15
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,15
Arm it in rags a pigmy's straw does pierce it.,15
Take that of me my friend who have the power,15
And like a scurvy politician seem,15
Pull off my boots: harder harder: so.,15
If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes.,15
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:,15
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.,15
When we are born we cry that we are come,15
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe,15
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,15
Enter a Gentleman with Attendants,15
Your most dear daughter--,15
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;,15
I am cut to the brains.,15
No seconds? all myself?,15
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,15
Good sir--,15
I will be jovial: come come; I am a king,15
You are a royal one and we obey you.,15
shall get it with running. Sa sa sa sa.,15
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,15
Who redeems nature from the general curse,15
Hail gentle sir.,15
Do you hear aught sir of a battle toward?,15
Which can distinguish sound.,15
How near's the other army?,15
Stands on the hourly thought.,15
Though that the queen on special cause is here,15
I thank you sir.,15
You ever-gentle gods take my breath from me:,15
To die before you please!,15
Now good sir what are you?,15
Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows,15
I'll lead you to some biding.,15
The bounty and the benison of heaven,15
Enter OSWALD,15
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh,15
Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out,15
Now let thy friendly hand,15
EDGAR interposes,15
Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;,15
Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.,15
Let go slave or thou diest!,15
pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,15
Nay come not near th' old man; keep out che vor,15
the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.,15
Ch'ill pick your teeth zir: come; no matter vor,15
They fight and EDGAR knocks him down,15
If ever thou wilt thrive bury my body;,15
To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out,15
Dies,15
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress,15
What is he dead?,15
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of,15
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:,15
To know our enemies' minds we'ld rip their hearts;,15
Reads,15
many opportunities to cut him off: if your will,15
There is nothing done if he return the conqueror:,15
the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and supply,15
Your--wife so I would say--,15
GONERIL.',15
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;,15
Thee I'll rake up the post unsanctified,15
With this ungracious paper strike the sight,15
That of thy death and business I can tell.,15
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling,15
So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,15
The knowledge of themselves.,15
Drum afar off,15
Come father I'll bestow you with a friend.,15
SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,15
Enter CORDELIA KENT and Doctor,15
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,15
To be acknowledged madam is o'erpaid.,15
Nor more nor clipp'd but so.,15
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:,15
Pardon me dear madam;,15
My boon I make it that you know me not,15
Then be't so my good lord.,15
How does the king?,15
O you kind gods,15
The untuned and jarring senses O wind up,15
So please your majesty,15
Be govern'd by your knowledge and proceed,15
Ay madam; in the heaviness of his sleep,15
Be by good madam when we do awake him;,15
Very well.,15
O my dear father! Restoration hang,15
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters,15
Kind and dear princess!,15
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face,15
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?,15
Of quick cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--,15
Though he had bit me should have stood that night,15
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,15
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once,15
Madam do you; 'tis fittest.,15
You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:,15
Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears,15
Sir do you know me?,15
Still still far wide!,15
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?,15
To see another thus. I know not what to say.,15
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured,15
O look upon me sir,15
No sir you must not kneel.,15
I am a very foolish fond old man,15
And to deal plainly,15
Methinks I should know you and know this man;,15
What place this is; and all the skill I have,15
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;,15
To be my child Cordelia.,15
Be your tears wet? yes 'faith. I pray weep not:,15
I know you do not love me; for your sisters,15
You have some cause they have not.,15
Am I in France?,15
Do not abuse me.,15
You see is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger,15
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more,15
Will't please your highness walk?,15
Pray you now forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.,15
Holds it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?,15
Who is conductor of his people?,15
They say Edgar his banished son is with the Earl,15
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the,15
The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you,15
Exit,15
Or well or ill as this day's battle's fought.,15
ACT V,15
Enter with drum and colours EDMUND REGAN Gentlemen and Soldiers.,15
Or whether since he is advised by aught,15
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.,15
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.,15
Now sweet lord,15
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,15
In honour'd love.,15
To the forfended place?,15
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct,15
No by mine honour madam.,15
Be not familiar with her.,15
She and the duke her husband!,15
[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister,15
Our very loving sister well be-met.,15
With others whom the rigor of our state,15
I never yet was valiant: for this business,15
Not bolds the king with others whom I fear,15
Sir you speak nobly.,15
Combine together 'gainst the enemy;,15
Are not the question here.,15
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.,15
Sister you'll go with us?,15
Tis most convenient; pray you go with us.,15
As they are going out enter EDGAR disguised,15
Hear me one word.,15
Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR,15
If you have victory let the trumpet sound,15
I can produce a champion that will prove,15
Your business of the world hath so an end,15
Stay till I have read the letter.,15
When time shall serve let but the herald cry,15
Why fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.,15
Re-enter EDMUND,15
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces,15
Is now urged on you.,15
Exit,15
Each jealous of the other as the stung,15
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,15
Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril;,15
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use,15
Let her who would be rid of him devise,15
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,15
Shall never see his pardon; for my state,15
Exit,15
Alarum within. Enter with drum and colours  KING LEAR CORDELIA and Soldiers over the stage; and exeunt,15
Here father take the shadow of this tree,15
If ever I return to you again,15
Grace go with you sir!,15
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR,15
King Lear hath lost he and his daughter ta'en:,15
No farther sir; a man may rot even here.,15
Their going hence even as their coming hither;,15
And that's true too.,15
SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.,15
Some officers take them away: good guard,15
That are to censure them.,15
Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.,15
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.,15
No no no no! Come let's away to prison:,15
When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down,15
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh,15
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,15
And take upon's the mystery of things,15
In a wall'd prison packs and sects of great ones,15
Take them away.,15
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?,15
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;,15
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve,15
Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA guarded,15
Take thou this note;,15
go follow them to prison:,15
As this instructs thee thou dost make thy way,15
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded,15
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,15
I'll do 't my lord.,15
Mark I say instantly; and carry it so,15
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats;,15
Exit,15
Sir you have shown to-day your valiant strain,15
That were the opposites of this day's strife:,15
As we shall find their merits and our safety,15
Sir I thought it fit,15
To some retention and appointed guard;,15
To pluck the common bosom on his side,15
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;,15
To-morrow or at further space to appear,15
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;,15
By those that feel their sharpness:,15
Requires a fitter place.,15
I hold you but a subject of this war,15
That's as we list to grace him.,15
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;,15
The which immediacy may well stand up,15
Not so hot:,15
More than in your addition.,15
By me invested he compeers the best.,15
Jesters do oft prove prophets.,15
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.,15
From a full-flowing stomach. General,15
Dispose of them of me; the walls are thine:,15
My lord and master.,15
The let-alone lies not in your good will.,15
Half-blooded fellow yes.,15
Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund I arrest thee,15
This gilded serpent,15
For your claim fair sister,15
Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,15
If you will marry make your loves to me,15
An interlude!,15
If none appear to prove upon thy head,15
There is my pledge;,15
I'll prove it on thy heart,15
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.,15
[Aside]  If not I'll ne'er trust medicine.,15
Throwing down a glove,15
That names me traitor villain-like he lies:,15
On him on you who not? I will maintain,15
A herald ho!,15
Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,15
Took their discharge.,15
She is not well; convey her to  my tent.,15
Enter a Herald,15
And read out this.,15
A trumpet sounds,15
the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,15
traitor let him appear by the third sound of the,15
Sound!,15
Again!,15
Again!,15
Trumpet answers within,15
Ask him his purposes why he appears,15
What are you?,15
This present summons?,15
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:,15
I come to cope.,15
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?,15
Draw thy sword,15
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.,15
My oath and my profession: I protest,15
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,15
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father;,15
And from the extremest upward of thy head,15
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No',15
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak,15
In wisdom I should ask thy name;,15
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,15
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn:,15
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;,15
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,15
Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls,15
This is practise Gloucester:,15
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,15
Shut your mouth dame,15
Thou worse than any name read thine own evil:,15
Gives the letter to EDMUND,15
Who can arraign me for't.,15
Know'st thou this paper?,15
Exit,15
What you have charged me with that have I done;,15
Tis past and so am I. But what art thou,15
I do forgive thee.,15
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund;,15
My name is Edgar and thy father's son.,15
Make instruments to plague us:,15
Cost him his eyes.,15
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.,15
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:,15
Did hate thee or thy father!,15
Where have you hid yourself?,15
By nursing them my lord. List a brief tale;,15
The bloody proclamation to escape,15
That we the pain of death would hourly die,15
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance,15
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,15
Led him begg'd for him saved him from despair;,15
Until some half-hour past when I was arm'd:,15
I ask'd his blessing and from first to last,15
Alack too weak the conflict to support!,15
Burst smilingly.,15
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;,15
If there be more more woeful hold it in;,15
Hearing of this.,15
To such as love not sorrow; but another,15
And top extremity.,15
Who having seen me in my worst estate,15
Who 'twas that so endured with his strong arms,15
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;,15
That ever ear received: which in recounting,15
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,15
But who was this?,15
Follow'd his enemy king and did him service,15
Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife,15
What kind of help?,15
What means that bloody knife?,15
It came even from the heart of--O she's dead!,15
Your lady sir your lady: and her sister,15
I was contracted to them both: all three,15
Here comes Kent.,15
This judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble,15
Exit Gentleman,15
O is this he?,15
Which very manners urges.,15
To bid my king and master aye good night:,15
Great thing of us forgot!,15
See'st thou this object Kent?,15
Alack why thus?,15
The one the other poison'd for my sake,15
Even so. Cover their faces.,15
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,15
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:,15
Run run O run!,15
Thy token of reprieve.,15
Give it the captain.,15
Exit EDGAR,15
To hang Cordelia in the prison and,15
That she fordid herself.,15
EDMUND is borne off,15
Howl howl howl howl! O you are men of stones:,15
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!,15
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;,15
Why then she lives.,15
Or image of that horror?,15
This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,15
That ever I have felt.,15
Prithee away.,15
A plague upon you murderers traitors all!,15
Cordelia Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!,15
Gentle and low an excellent thing in woman.,15
Tis true my lords he did.,15
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion,15
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?,15
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,15
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?,15
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?,15
He'll strike and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.,15
I'll see that straight.,15
Have follow'd your sad steps.,15
Nor no man else: all's cheerless dark and deadly.,15
And desperately are dead.,15
He knows not what he says: and vain it is,15
Very bootless.,15
Edmund is dead my lord.,15
You lords and noble friends know our intent.,15
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,15
To him our absolute power:,15
you to your rights:,15
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste,15
The cup of their deservings. O see see!,15
Why should a dog a horse a rat have life,15
Never never never never never!,15
Do you see this? Look on her look her lips,15
Dies,15
Break heart; I prithee break!,15
Vex not his ghost: O let him pass! he hates him much,15
Stretch him out longer.,15
The wonder is he hath endured so long:,15
Bear them from hence. Our present business,15
To KENT and EDGAR,15
Rule in this realm and the gored state sustain.,15
My master calls me I must not say no.,15
Speak what we feel not what we ought to say.,15
Shall never see so much nor live so long.,15
ACT I,16
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN,16
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs,16
When spite of cormorant devouring Time,16
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,16
Therefore brave conquerors--for so you are,16
And the huge army of the world's desires--,16
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;,16
Still and contemplative in living art.,16
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me,16
That are recorded in this schedule here:,16
That his own hand may strike his honour down,16
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,16
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:,16
Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits,16
My loving lord Dumain is mortified:,16
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:,16
With all these living in philosophy.,16
So much dear liege I have already sworn,16
But there are other strict observances;,16
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;,16
And but one meal on every day beside,16
And then to sleep but three hours in the night,16
When I was wont to think no harm all night,16
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:,16
Not to see ladies study fast not sleep!,16
Let me say no my liege an if you please:,16
And stay here in your court for three years' space.,16
By yea and nay sir then I swore in jest.,16
Why that to know which else we should not know.,16
Ay that is study's godlike recompense.,16
To know the thing I am forbid to know:,16
When I to feast expressly am forbid;,16
When mistresses from common sense are hid;,16
Study to break it and not break my troth.,16
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:,16
These be the stops that hinder study quite,16
Why all delights are vain; but that most vain,16
As painfully to pore upon a book,16
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:,16
So ere you find where light in darkness lies,16
Study me how to please the eye indeed,16
Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed,16
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,16
Small have continual plodders ever won,16
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights,16
Have no more profit of their shining nights,16
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;,16
How well he's read to reason against reading!,16
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.,16
How follows that?,16
In reason nothing.,16
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,16
Well say I am; why should proud summer boast,16
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?,16
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;,16
So you to study now it is too late,16
Well sit you out: go home Biron: adieu.,16
And though I have for barbarism spoke more,16
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore,16
Give me the paper; let me read the same;,16
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!,16
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?,16
Let's see the penalty.,16
On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?,16
Sweet lord and why?,16
A dangerous law against gentility!,16
Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman,16
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.',16
For well you know here comes in embassy,16
A maid of grace and complete majesty--,16
To her decrepit sick and bedrid father:,16
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.,16
So study evermore is overshot:,16
It doth forget to do the thing it should,16
Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost.,16
She must lie here on mere necessity.,16
Three thousand times within this three years' space;,16
Not by might master'd but by special grace:,16
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.',16
Subscribes,16
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:,16
But I believe although I seem so loath,16
But is there no quick recreation granted?,16
With a refined traveller of Spain;,16
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;,16
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;,16
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:,16
For interim to our studies shall relate,16
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.,16
But I protest I love to hear him lie,16
Armado is a most illustrious wight,16
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;,16
Enter DULL with a letter and COSTARD,16
This fellow: what wouldst?,16
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person,16
This is he.,16
abroad: this letter will tell you more.,16
A letter from the magnificent Armado.,16
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!,16
To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately; or to,16
Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to,16
The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta.,16
In what manner?,16
I was seen with her in the manor-house sitting with,16
park; which put together is in manner and form,16
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form--,16
For the following sir?,16
the right!,16
As we would hear an oracle.,16
[Reads]  'Great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and,16
and body's fostering patron.',16
[Reads]  'So it is'--,16
telling true but so.,16
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!,16
Of other men's secrets I beseech you.,16
melancholy I did commend the black-oppressing humour,16
air; and as I am a gentleman betook myself to,16
beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down,16
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,16
for the place where; where I mean I did encounter,16
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink which,16
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east,16
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited,16
Me?,16
Me?,16
Still me?,16
O me!,16
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,16
wherewith--,16
[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve a,16
woman. Him I as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,16
punishment by thy sweet grace's officer Anthony,16
estimation.',16
[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta--so is the weaker vessel,16
swain--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;,16
her to trial. Thine in all compliments of devoted,16
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.',16
that ever I heard.,16
you to this?,16
Did you hear the proclamation?,16
the marking of it.,16
with a wench.,16
Well it was proclaimed 'damsel.',16
It is so varied too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.',16
This maid will not serve your turn sir.,16
Sir I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast,16
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.,16
My Lord Biron see him deliver'd o'er:,16
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.,16
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,16
Sirrah come on.,16
taken with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true,16
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and,16
Exeunt,16
SCENE II. The same.,16
DON,16
grows melancholy?,16
DON,16
No no; O Lord sir no.,16
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy my,16
By a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior.,16
Why tough senior? why tough senior?,16
DON,16
appertaining to thy young days which we may,16
And I tough senior as an appertinent title to your,16
DON ADRIANO DE,16
How mean you sir? I pretty and my saying apt? or,16
DON,16
Little pretty because little. Wherefore apt?,16
And therefore apt because quick.,16
DON,16
I will praise an eel with the same praise.,16
What that an eel is ingenious?,16
DON,16
I am answered sir.,16
I love not to be crossed.,16
DON,16
You may do it in an hour sir.,16
Impossible.,16
DON,16
You are a gentleman and a gamester sir.,16
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a,16
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of,16

True.,16

study three years in two words the dancing horse,16
DON,16
To prove you a cipher.,16
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is,16
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour,16
thought of it I would take Desire prisoner and,16
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should,16
have been in love?,16
DON,16
more; and sweet my child let them be men of good,16
Samson master: he was a man of good carriage great,16
like a porter: and he was in love.,16
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do,16
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's,16
A woman master.,16
Of what complexion?,16
DON,16
Of the sea-water green sir.,16
Is that one of the four complexions?,16
DON,16
love of that colour methinks Samson had small reason,16
It was so sir; for she had a green wit.,16
My love is most immaculate white and red.,16
such colours.,16
Define define well-educated infant.,16
DON,16

Her faults will ne'er be known,16
And fears by pale white shown:,16
By this you shall not know,16
Which native she doth owe.,16
white and red.,16
Is there not a ballad boy of the King and the Beggar?,16
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be,16
the writing nor the tune.,16
I will have that subject newly writ o'er that I may,16
Boy I do love that country girl that I took in the,16
[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than,16

And that's great marvel loving a light wench.,16

It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their,16
God I have as little patience as another man; and,16
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD,16
I do affect the very ground which is base where,16
is basest doth tread. I shall be forsworn which,16
how can that be true love which is falsely,16
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so,16
Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit.,16
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.,16
the passado he respects not the duello he regards,16
glory is to subdue men. Adieu valour! rust rapier!,16
he loveth. Assist me some extemporal god of rhyme,16

To parley with the sole inheritor,16
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight,16
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace,16
When she did starve the general world beside,16
Good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean,16
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,16
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth,16
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.,16
You are not ignorant all-telling fame,16
Till painful study shall outwear three years,16
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,16
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,16
As our best-moving fair solicitor.,16
On serious business craving quick dispatch,16
Haste signify so much; while we attend,16
Proud of employment willingly I go.,16
Exit BOYET,16
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?,16
Know you the man?,16
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir,16
In Normandy saw I this Longaville:,16
Well fitted in arts glorious in arms:,16
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,16
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;,16
It should none spare that come within his power.,16
They say so most that most his humours know.,16
Who are the rest?,16
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:,16
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,16
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;,16
Is my report to his great worthiness.,16
Was there with him if I have heard a truth.,16
Within the limit of becoming mirth,16
His eye begets occasion for his wit;,16
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,16
Delivers in such apt and gracious words,16
And younger hearings are quite ravished;,16
God bless my ladies! are they all in love,16
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?,16
Re-enter BOYET,16
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;,16
Were all address'd to meet you gentle lady,16
He rather means to lodge you in the field,16
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,16
Here comes Navarre.,16
Fair princess welcome to the court of Navarre.,16
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be,16
You shall be welcome madam to my court.,16
Hear me dear lady; I have sworn an oath.,16
Not for the world fair madam by my will.,16
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.,16
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.,16
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord,16
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:,16
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,16
Madam I will if suddenly I may.,16
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.,16
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?,16
How needless was it then to ask the question!,16
Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.,16
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.,16
The hour that fools should ask.,16
Fair fall the face it covers!,16
Amen so you be none.,16
Madam your father here doth intimate,16
Being but the one half of an entire sum,16
But say that he or we as neither have,16
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,16
Although not valued to the money's worth.,16
But that one half which is unsatisfied,16
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.,16
For here he doth demand to have repaid,16
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,16
Which we much rather had depart withal,16
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.,16
From reason's yielding your fair self should make,16
And go well satisfied to France again.,16
And wrong the reputation of your name,16
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.,16
And if you prove it I'll repay it back,16
We arrest your word.,16
For such a sum from special officers,16
Satisfy me so.,16
Where that and other specialties are bound:,16
It shall suffice me: at which interview,16
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand,16
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:,16
But here without you shall be so received,16
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.,16
To-morrow shall we visit you again.,16
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!,16
Lady I will commend you to mine own heart.,16
I would you heard it groan.,16
Sick at the heart.,16
Would that do it good?,16
Will you prick't with your eye?,16
Now God save thy life!,16
I cannot stay thanksgiving.,16
Sir I pray you a word: what lady is that same?,16
A gallant lady. Monsieur fare you well.,16
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?,16
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.,16
Pray you sir whose daughter?,16
God's blessing on your beard!,16
She is an heir of Falconbridge.,16
She is a most sweet lady.,16

Farewell to me sir and welcome to you.,16
That last is Biron the merry madcap lord:,16
And every jest but a word.,16
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.,16
And wherefore not ships?,16
You sheep and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?,16
Offering to kiss her,16
My lips are no common though several they be.,16
To my fortunes and me.,16
This civil war of wits were much better used,16
If my observation which very seldom lies,16
Deceive me not now Navarre is infected.,16
With that which we lovers entitle affected.,16
Why all his behaviors did make their retire,16
His heart like an agate with your print impress'd,16
His tongue all impatient to speak and not see,16
All senses to that sense did make their repair,16
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,16
Who tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,16
His face's own margent did quote such amazes,16
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,16
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.,16
disclosed.,16
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.,16
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.,16

Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?,16
I that am honest; I that hold it sin,16
I am betray'd by keeping company,16
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?,16
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I,16
A gait a state a brow a breast a waist,16
Soft! whither away so fast?,16
I post from love: good lover let me go.,16
God bless the king!,16
Some certain treason.,16
Nay it makes nothing sir.,16
The treason and you go in peace away together.,16
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason he said.,16
Giving him the paper,16
Of Costard.,16
Of Dun Adramadio Dun Adramadio.,16
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?,16
It did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it.,16
Gathering up the pieces,16
born to do me shame.,16
What?,16
He he and you and you my liege and I,16
O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more.,16
True true; we are four.,16
Hence sirs; away!,16
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA,16
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:,16
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:,16
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.,16
Did they quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,16
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,16
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?,16
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,16
What zeal what fury hath inspired thee now?,16
She an attending star scarce seen a light.,16
O but for my love day would turn to night!,16
Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek,16
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.,16
Fie painted rhetoric! O she needs it not:,16
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.,16
Might shake off fifty looking in her eye:,16
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:,16
By heaven thy love is black as ebony.,16
A wife of such wood were felicity.,16
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,16
No face is fair that is not full so black.,16
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;,16
Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light.,16
It mourns that painting and usurping hair,16
And therefore is she born to make black fair.,16
For native blood is counted painting now;,16
Paints itself black to imitate her brow.,16
And since her time are colliers counted bright.,16
Dark needs no candles now for dark is light.,16
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.,16
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.,16
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.,16
Look here's thy love: my foot and her face see.,16
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!,16
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.,16
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.,16
Our loving lawful and our faith not torn.,16
O some authority how to proceed;,16
Some salve for perjury.,16
Have at you then affection's men at arms.,16
To fast to study and to see no woman;,16
Say can you fast? your stomachs are too young;,16
And where that you have vow'd to study lords,16
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?,16
Have found the ground of study's excellence,16
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground the books the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire,16
The nimble spirits in the arteries,16
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.,16
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,16
For where is any author in the world,16
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,16
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,16
O we have made a vow to study lords,16
For when would you my liege or you or you,16
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes,16
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;,16
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:,16
Lives not alone immured in the brain;,16
Courses as swift as thought in every power,16
Above their functions and their offices.,16
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;,16
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:,16
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;,16
For valour is not Love a Hercules,16
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical,16
And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods,16
Never durst poet touch a pen to write,16
O then his lines would ravish savage ears,16
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:,16
They are the books the arts the academes,16
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.,16
Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools.,16
Or for love's sake a word that loves all men,16
Or women's sake by whom we men are men,16
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.,16
For charity itself fulfills the law,16
Saint Cupid then! and soldiers to the field!,16
Pell-mell down with them! but be first advised,16
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:,16
And win them too: therefore let us devise,16
First from the park let us conduct them thither;,16
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon,16
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;,16
Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers.,16
That will betime and may by us be fitted.,16
And justice always whirls in equal measure:,16
If so our copper buys no better treasure.,16
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST,16
SCENE I. The same.,16
Satis quod sufficit.,16
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without,16
impudency learned without opinion and strange with-,16
a companion of the king's who is intituled nomi-,16
Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty his,16
ambitious his gait majestical and his general,16
too picked too spruce too affected too odd as it,16
A most singular and choice epithet.,16
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer,16
fanatical phantasimes such insociable and,16
orthography as to speak dout fine when he should,16
e b t not d e t: he clepeth a calf cauf;,16
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable--which he,16
insanie: anne intelligis domine? to make frantic lunatic.,16
Bon bon fort bon Priscian! a little scratch'd,16
Videsne quis venit?,16
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO MOTH and COSTARD,16
Chirrah!,16
Quare chirrah not sirrah?,16
Men of peace well encountered.,16
[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast,16
O they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.,16
for thou art not so long by the head as,16
swallowed than a flap-dragon.,16
DON,16
Yes yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,16
Ba pueritia with a horn added.,16
Quis quis thou consonant?,16
the fifth if I.,16
The sheep: the other two concludes it--o u.,16
Now by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum a sweet,16
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!,16
What is the figure? what is the figure?,16
Thou disputest like an infant: go whip thy gig.,16
your infamy circum circa--a gig of a cuckold's horn.,16
have it to buy gingerbread: hold there is the very,16
purse of wit thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O an,16
bastard what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!,16
ends as they say.,16
DON,16
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the,16
Or mons the hill.,16
At your sweet pleasure for the mountain.,16
DON,16
affection to congratulate the princess at her,16
rude multitude call the afternoon.,16
liable congruent and measurable for the afternoon:,16
assure you sir I do assure.,16
Sir the king is a noble gentleman and my familiar,16
inward between us let it pass. I do beseech thee,16
head: and among other important and most serious,16
that pass: for I must tell thee it will please his,16
shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally,16
heart let that pass. By the world I recount no,16
greatness to impart to Armado a soldier a man of,16
The very all of all is--but sweet heart I do,16
present the princess sweet chuck with some,16
antique or firework. Now understanding that the,16
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth as it,16
crave your assistance.,16
Sir as concerning some entertainment of time some,16
our assistants at the king's command and this most,16
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the,16
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?,16
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain because of his great,16
page Hercules--,16
Pardon sir; error: he is not quantity enough for,16
Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in,16
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.,16
hiss you may cry 'Well done Hercules! now thou,16
offence gracious though few have the grace to do it.,16
For the rest of the Worthies?--,16
Thrice-worthy gentleman!,16
Shall I tell you a thing?,16
DON,16
beseech you follow.,16
Nor understood none neither sir.,16
I'll make one in a dance or so; or I will play,16
Most dull honest Dull! To our sport away!,16
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST,16
Enter the PRINCESS KATHARINE ROSALINE and MARIA,16
If fairings come thus plentifully in:,16
Look you what I have from the loving king.,16
Nothing but this! yes as much love in rhyme,16
Writ o' both sides the leaf margent and all,16
That was the way to make his godhead wax,16
Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.,16
He made her melancholy sad and heavy;,16
Of such a merry nimble stirring spirit,16
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.,16
A light condition in a beauty dark.,16
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;,16
Look what you do you do it still i' the dark.,16
Indeed I weigh not you and therefore light.,16
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.',16
But Rosaline you have a favour too:,16
I would you knew:,16
My favour were as great; be witness this.,16
The numbers true; and were the numbering too,16
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.,16
Any thing like?,16
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.,16
Ware pencils ho! let me not die your debtor,16
O that your face were not so full of O's!,16
But Katharine what was sent to you from fair Dumain?,16
Did he not send you twain?,16
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,16
Vilely compiled profound simplicity.,16
The letter is too long by half a mile.,16
The chain were longer and the letter short?,16
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.,16
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:,16
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek,16
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,16
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!,16
That he should be my fool and I his fate.,16
As wit turn'd fool: folly in wisdom hatch'd,16
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.,16
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.,16
As foolery in the wise when wit doth dote;,16
To prove by wit worth in simplicity.,16
Enter BOYET,16
Thy news Boyet?,16
Arm wenches arm! encounters mounted are,16
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:,16
Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence.,16
That charge their breath against us? say scout say.,16
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;,16
Toward that shade I might behold addrest,16
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,16
That by and by disguised they will be here.,16
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:,16
Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear:',16
Presence majestical would put him out,16
Yet fear not thou but speak audaciously.',16
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.',16
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:,16
A better speech was never spoke before;,16
Cried 'Via! we will do't come what will come;',16
The fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell.,16
With such a zealous laughter so profound,16
To cheque their folly passion's solemn tears.,16
They do they do: and are apparell'd thus.,16
Their purpose is to parle to court and dance;,16
Unto his several mistress which they'll know,16
And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;,16
And not a man of them shall have the grace,16
Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear,16
Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine,16
And change your favours too; so shall your loves,16
Come on then; wear the favours most in sight.,16
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:,16
And mock for mock is only my intent.,16
To loves mistook and so be mock'd withal,16
With visages displayed to talk and greet.,16
No to the death we will not move a foot;,16
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.,16
And quite divorce his memory from his part.,16
The rest will ne'er come in if he be out,16
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:,16
And they well mock'd depart away with shame.,16
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.,16
Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND  BIRON LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN in Russian habits and masked,16
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.,16
The Ladies turn their backs to him,16
[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes villain their eyes!,16
True; out indeed.,16
Not to behold--,16
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,16
They will not answer to that epithet;,16
They do not mark me and that brings me out.,16
Exit MOTH,16
If they do speak our language 'tis our will:,16
Know what they would.,16
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.,16
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.,16
She says you have it and you may be gone.,16
To tread a measure with her on this grass.,16
To tread a measure with you on this grass.,16
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,16
If to come hither you have measured miles,16
How many inches doth fill up one mile.,16
She hears herself.,16
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,16
We number nothing that we spend for you:,16
That we may do it still without accompt.,16
That we like savages may worship it.,16
Blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do!,16
Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne.,16
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.,16
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.,16
Music plays,16
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?,16
Yet still she is the moon and I the man.,16
Our ears vouchsafe it.,16
Since you are strangers and come here by chance,16
Why take we hands then?,16
Curtsy sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.,16
We can afford no more at such a price.,16
Your absence only.,16
Then cannot we be bought: and so adieu;,16
If you deny to dance let's hold more chat.,16
I am best pleased with that.,16
White-handed mistress one sweet word with thee.,16
Nay then two treys and if you grow so nice,16
There's half-a-dozen sweets.,16
Since you can cog I'll play no more with you.,16
Let it not be sweet.,16
Gall! bitter.,16
They converse apart,16
Name it.,16
Say you so? Fair lord--,16
Please it you,16
They converse apart,16
I know the reason lady why you ask.,16
You have a double tongue within your mask,16
Veal quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?,16
No a fair lord calf.,16
No I'll not be your half,16
Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!,16
Then die a calf before your horns do grow.,16
Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.,16
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen,16
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,16
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings,16
Not one word more my maids; break off break off.,16
Farewell mad wenches; you have simple wits.,16
Exeunt FERDINAND Lords and Blackamoors,16
Tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out.,16
O poverty in wit kingly-poor flout!,16
Or ever but in vizards show their faces?,16
O they were all in lamentable cases!,16
Biron did swear himself out of all suit.,16
No point quoth I; my servant straight was mute.,16
And trow you what he called me?,16
Yes in good faith.,16
Well better wits have worn plain statute-caps.,16
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.,16
Dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree.,16
Immediately they will again be here,16
They will digest this harsh indignity.,16
They will they will God knows,16
Therefore change favours; and when they repair,16
How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.,16
Dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown,16
Avaunt perplexity! What shall we do,16
Good madam if by me you'll be advised,16
Let us complain to them what fools were here,16
And wonder what they were and to what end,16
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,16
Ladies withdraw: the gallants are at hand.,16
Exeunt PRINCESS ROSALINE KATHARINE and MARIA,16
Fair sir God save you! Where's the princess?,16
Command me any service to her thither?,16
I will; and so will she I know my lord.,16
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,16
He is wit's pedler and retails his wares,16
And we that sell by gross the Lord doth know,16
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;,16
A' can carve too and lisp: why this is he,16
This is the ape of form monsieur the nice,16
In honourable terms: nay he can sing,16
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;,16
This is the flower that smiles on every one,16
And consciences that will not die in debt,16
A blister on his sweet tongue with my heart,16
See where it comes! Behavior what wert thou,16
Re-enter the PRINCESS ushered by BOYET ROSALINE MARIA and KATHARINE,16
Fair' in 'all hail' is foul as I conceive.,16
Then wish me better; I will give you leave.,16
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.,16
Nor God nor I delights in perjured men.,16
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.,16
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.,16
As the unsullied lily I protest,16
I would not yield to be your house's guest;,16
Of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity.,16
Unseen unvisited much to our shame.,16
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:,16
How madam! Russians!,16
Trim gallants full of courtship and of state.,16
My lady to the manner of the days,16
We four indeed confronted were with four,16
And talk'd apace; and in that hour my lord,16
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,16
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,16
With eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye,16
Is of that nature that to your huge store,16
This proves you wise and rich for in my eye--,16
But that you take what doth to you belong,16
O I am yours and all that I possess!,16
I cannot give you less.,16
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?,16
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.,16
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.,16
Help hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?,16
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.,16
lady dart thy skill at me;,16
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;,16
And I will wish thee never more to dance,16
O never will I trust to speeches penn'd,16
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,16
Taffeta phrases silken terms precise,16
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies,16
I do forswear them; and I here protest,16
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd,16
And to begin wench--so God help me la!--,16
Sans sans I pray you.,16
Of the old rage: bear with me I am sick;,16
Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;,16
They have the plague and caught it of your eyes;,16
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.,16
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.,16
That you stand forfeit being those that sue?,16
Nor shall not if I do as I intend.,16
Teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression,16
The fairest is confession.,16
Madam I was.,16
I was fair madam.,16
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?,16
When she shall challenge this you will reject her.,16
Peace peace! forbear:,16
Despise me when I break this oath of mine.,16
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?,16
As precious eyesight and did value me,16
That he would wed me or else die my lover.,16
Most honourably doth unhold his word.,16
I never swore this lady such an oath.,16
You gave me this: but take it sir again.,16
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.,16
And Lord Biron I thank him is my dear.,16
Neither of either; I remit both twain.,16
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,16
Some carry-tale some please-man some slight zany,16
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick,16
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,16
Following the signs woo'd but the sign of she.,16
We are again forsworn in will and error.,16
To BOYET,16
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,16
And stand between her back sir and the fire,16
You put our page out: go you are allow'd;,16
You leer upon me do you? there's an eye,16
Full merrily,16
Lo he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.,16
Welcome pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.,16
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.,16
No sir; but it is vara fine,16
And three times thrice is nine.,16
You cannot beg us sir I can assure you sir we know,16
I hope sir three times thrice sir--,16
Under correction sir we know whereuntil it doth amount.,16
O Lord sir it were pity you should get your living,16
How much is it?,16
sir will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine,16
in one poor man Pompion the Great sir.,16
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the,16
the Worthy but I am to stand for him.,16
We will turn it finely off sir; we will take,16
Exit,16
We are shame-proof my lord: and tis some policy,16
I say they shall not come.,16
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:,16
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:,16
When great things labouring perish in their birth.,16
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO,16
Anointed I implore so much expense of thy royal,16
Converses apart with FERDINAND and delivers him a paper,16
Why ask you?,16
DON,16
I protest the schoolmaster is exceeding,16
will put it as they say to fortuna de la guerra.,16
Exit,16
presents Hector of Troy; the swain Pompey the,16
Hercules; the pedant Judas Maccabaeus: And if,16
These four will change habits and present the other five.,16
You are deceived; 'tis not so.,16
and the boy:--,16
Cannot pick out five such take each one in his vein.,16
Enter COSTARD for Pompey,16
You lie you are not he.,16
With libbard's head on knee.,16
with thee.,16
The Great.,16
Pompey surnamed the Great;,16
my foe to sweat:,16
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,16
Great thanks great Pompey.,16
made a little fault in 'Great.',16
Enter SIR NATHANIEL for Alexander,16
commander;,16
conquering might:,16
Your nose says no you are not for it stands too right.,16
The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed good Alexander.,16
commander--,16
Pompey the Great--,16
Take away the conqueror take away Alisander.,16
Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of,16
his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool will be given,16
and afeard to speak! run away for shame Alisander.,16
There an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an,16
marvellous good neighbour faith and a very good,16
tis--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies,16
Enter HOLOFERNES for Judas; and MOTH for Hercules,16
Whose club kill'd Cerberus that three-headed canis;,16
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.,16
Ergo I come with this apology.,16
MOTH retires,16
A Judas!,16
Judas I am ycliped Maccabaeus.,16
A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?,16
The more shame for you Judas.,16
To make Judas hang himself.,16
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.,16
Because thou hast no face.,16
A cittern-head.,16
A Death's face in a ring.,16
The pommel of Caesar's falchion.,16
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.,16
Ay and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.,16
You have put me out of countenance.,16
But you have out-faced them all.,16
Therefore as he is an ass let him go.,16
For the latter end of his name.,16
This is not generous not gentle not humble.,16
HOLOFERNES retires,16
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO for Hector,16
Though my mocks come home by me I will now be merry.,16
But is this Hector?,16
His leg is too big for Hector's.,16
No; he is best endued in the small.,16
He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.,16
The armipotent Mars of lances the almighty,16
A gilt nutmeg.,16
Stuck with cloves.,16
DON,16
The armipotent Mars of lances the almighty,16
A man so breathed that certain he would fight; yea,16
I am that flower--,16
That columbine.,16
Sweet Lord Longaville rein thy tongue.,16
Ay and Hector's a greyhound.,16
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,16
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.,16
Sweet royalty bestow on me the sense of hearing.,16
DON,16
[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot--,16
DON,16
The party is gone fellow Hector she is gone; she,16
DON,16
Faith unless you play the honest Troyan the poor,16
her belly already: tis yours.,16
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt,16
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is,16
him.,16
Renowned Pompey!,16
Pompey the Huge!,16
Pompey is moved. More Ates more Ates! stir them,16
Hector will challenge him.,16
sup a flea.,16
By the north pole I do challenge thee.,16
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,16
Room for the incensed Worthies!,16
Most resolute Pompey!,16
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean,16
DON,16
in my shirt.,16
DON,16
What reason have you for't?,16
The naked truth of it is I have no shirt; I go,16
True and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of,16
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's and that a' wears next,16
Enter MERCADE,16
Welcome Mercade;,16
I am sorry madam; for the news I bring,16
Dead for my life!,16
Worthies away! the scene begins to cloud.,16
For mine own part I breathe free breath. I have,16
discretion and I will right myself like a soldier.,16
How fares your majesty?,16
Madam not so; I do beseech you stay.,16
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,16
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide,16
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves,16
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!,16
Excuse me so coming too short of thanks,16
The extreme parts of time extremely forms,16
And often at his very loose decides,16
And though the mourning brow of progeny,16
The holy suit which fain it would convince,16
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it,16
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable,16
I understand you not: my griefs are double.,16
And by these badges understand the king.,16
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty ladies,16
Even to the opposed end of our intents:,16
As love is full of unbefitting strains,16
Form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye,16
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll,16
Which parti-coated presence of loose love,16
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,16
Suggested us to make. Therefore ladies,16
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,16
To those that make us both--fair ladies you:,16
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.,16
Your favours the ambassadors of love;,16
At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy,16
But more devout than this in our respects,16
In their own fashion like a merriment.,16
So did our looks.,16
Now at the latest minute of the hour,16
A time methinks too short,16
No no my lord your grace is perjured much,16
If for my love as there is no such cause,16
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed,16
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;,16
Have brought about the annual reckoning.,16
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;,16
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,16
Then at the expiration of the year,16
And by this virgin palm now kissing thine,16
My woeful self up in a mourning house,16
For the remembrance of my father's death.,16
Neither entitled in the other's heart.,16
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,16
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.,16
A beard fair health and honesty;,16
O shall I say I thank you gentle wife?,16
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:,16
Then if I have much love I'll give you some.,16
Yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again.,16
At the twelvemonth's end,16
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.,16
Studies my lady? mistress look on me;,16
What humble suit attends thy answer there:,16
Oft have I heard of you my Lord Biron,16
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,16
Which you on all estates will execute,16
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,16
Without the which I am not to be won,16
Visit the speechless sick and still converse,16
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit,16
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?,16
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.,16
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace,16
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear,16
Of him that makes it: then if sickly ears,16
Will hear your idle scorns continue then,16
But if they will not throw away that spirit,16
Right joyful of your reformation.,16
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.,16
No madam; we will bring you on your way.,16
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy,16
Come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day,16
That's too long for a play.,16
DON,16
Was not that Hector?,16
DON,16
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the,16
esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that,16
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the,16
Call them forth quickly; we will do so.,16
Holla! approach.,16
This side is Hiems Winter this Ver the Spring;,16
cuckoo. Ver begin.,16
SPRING.,16
And lady-smocks all silver-white,16
Do paint the meadows with delight,16
Mocks married men; for thus sings he  Cuckoo;,16
Unpleasing to a married ear!,16
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,16
And maidens bleach their summer smocks,16
Mocks married men; for thus sings he  Cuckoo;,16
Unpleasing to a married ear!,16
When icicles hang by the wall,16
And Tom bears logs into the hall,16
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,16
Tu-who a merry note,16
When all aloud the wind doth blow,16
And birds sit brooding in the snow,16
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,16
Tu-who a merry note,16
DON,16
Apollo. You that way: we this way.,16
ACT I,17
Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches,17
In thunder lightning or in rain?,17
When the battle's lost and won.,17
Where the place?,17
There to meet with Macbeth.,17
Paddock calls.,17
Fair is foul and foul is fair:,17
Exeunt,17
Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM DONALBAIN LENNOX with Attendants meeting a bleeding Sergeant,17
As seemeth by his plight of the revolt,17
This is the sergeant,17
Gainst my captivity. Hail brave friend!,17
As thou didst leave it.,17
As two spent swimmers that do cling together,17
Worthy to be a rebel for to that,17
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles,17
And fortune on his damned quarrel smiling,17
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--,17
Which smoked with bloody execution,17
Till he faced the slave;,17
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,17
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!,17
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,17
Discomfort swells. Mark king of Scotland mark:,17
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,17
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,17
Dismay'd not this,17
Yes;,17
If I say sooth I must report they were,17
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:,17
Or memorise another Golgotha,17
But I am faint my gashes cry for help.,17
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.,17
Who comes here?,17
The worthy thane of Ross.,17
That seems to speak things strange.,17
Whence camest thou worthy thane?,17
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky,17
With terrible numbers,17
The thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict;,17
Confronted him with self-comparisons,17
Curbing his lavish spirit: and to conclude,17
Great happiness!,17
Sweno the Norways' king craves composition:,17
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch,17
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive,17
And with his former title greet Macbeth.,17
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.,17
SCENE III. A heath near Forres.,17
Where hast thou been sister?,17
Sister where thou?,17
And munch'd and munch'd and munch'd:--,17
Aroint thee witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.,17
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,17
I'll do I'll do and I'll do.,17
Thou'rt kind.,17
I myself have all the other,17
All the quarters that they know,17
I will drain him dry as hay:,17
Hang upon his pent-house lid;,17
Weary se'nnights nine times nine,17
Though his bark cannot be lost,17
Look what I have.,17
Here I have a pilot's thumb,17
Drum within,17
Macbeth doth come.,17
Posters of the sea and land,17
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine,17
Peace! the charm's wound up.,17
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.,17
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,17
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught,17
By each at once her chappy finger laying,17
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret,17
Speak if you can: what are you?,17
All hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Cawdor!,17
Good sir why do you start; and seem to fear,17
Are ye fantastical or that indeed,17
You greet with present grace and great prediction,17
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.,17
And say which grain will grow and which will not,17
Your favours nor your hate.,17
Hail!,17
Lesser than Macbeth and greater.,17
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none:,17
Banquo and Macbeth all hail!,17
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;,17
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king,17
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence,17
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way,17
Witches vanish,17
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?,17
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!,17
Or have we eaten on the insane root,17
Your children shall be kings.,17
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?,17
Enter ROSS and ANGUS,17
The news of thy success; and when he reads,17
His wonders and his praises do contend,17
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,17
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,17
Came post with post; and every one did bear,17
And pour'd them down before him.,17
To give thee from our royal master thanks;,17
Not pay thee.,17
He bade me from him call thee thane of Cawdor:,17
For it is thine.,17
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me,17
Who was the thane lives yet;,17
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined,17
With hidden help and vantage or that with both,17
But treasons capital confess'd and proved,17
[Aside]  Glamis and thane of Cawdor!,17
To ROSS and ANGUS,17
To BANQUO,17
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me,17
That trusted home,17
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:,17
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,17
In deepest consequence.,17
[Aside] Two truths are told,17
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you gentlemen.,17
Cannot be ill cannot be good: if ill,17
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:,17
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,17
Against the use of nature? Present fears,17
My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical,17
Is smother'd in surmise and nothing is,17
Look how our partner's rapt.,17
Without my stir.,17
Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould,17
[Aside]                Come what come may,17
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure.,17
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen your pains,17
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.,17
The interim having weigh'd it let us speak,17
Very gladly.,17
Exeunt,17
Flourish. Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM DONALBAIN LENNOX and Attendants,17
Those in commission yet return'd?,17
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke,17
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,17
A deep repentance: nothing in his life,17
As one that had been studied in his death,17
As 'twere a careless trifle.,17
To find the mind's construction in the face:,17
An absolute trust.,17
O worthiest cousin!,17
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before,17
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,17
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,17
The service and the loyalty I owe,17
Is to receive our duties; and our duties,17
Which do but what they should by doing every thing,17
Welcome hither:,17
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,17
No less to have done so let me enfold thee,17
There if I grow,17
My plenteous joys,17
In drops of sorrow. Sons kinsmen thanes,17
We will establish our estate upon,17
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must,17
But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine,17
And bind us further to you.,17
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful,17
So humbly take my leave.,17
[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step,17
For in my way it lies. Stars hide your fires;,17
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,17
Exit,17
And in his commendations I am fed;,17
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:,17
Flourish. Exeunt,17
Enter LADY MACBETH reading a letter,17
learned by the perfectest report they have more in,17
to question them further they made themselves air,17
the wonder of it came missives from the king who,17
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred,17
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver,17
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being,17
to thy heart and farewell.',17
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;,17
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;,17
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,17
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have great Glamis,17
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,17
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;,17
All that impedes thee from the golden round,17
To have thee crown'd withal.,17
What is your tidings?,17
Thou'rt mad to say it:,17
Would have inform'd for preparation.,17
One of my fellows had the speed of him,17
Than would make up his message.,17
He brings great news.,17
The raven himself is hoarse,17
Under my battlements. Come you spirits,17
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full,17
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,17
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between,17
And take my milk for gall you murdering ministers,17
You wait on nature's mischief! Come thick night,17
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,17
To cry 'Hold hold!',17
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!,17
Thy letters have transported me beyond,17
The future in the instant.,17
Duncan comes here to-night.,17
To-morrow as he purposes.,17
Shall sun that morrow see!,17
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,17
Your hand your tongue: look like the innocent flower,17
Must be provided for: and you shall put,17
Which shall to all our nights and days to come,17
We will speak further.,17
To alter favour ever is to fear:,17
Exeunt,17
Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN MALCOLM  DONALBAIN BANQUO LENNOX MACDUFF ROSS ANGUS and Attendants,17
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself,17
This guest of summer,17
By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath,17
Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird,17
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed,17
Enter LADY MACBETH,17
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,17
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,17
All our service,17
Were poor and single business to contend,17
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,17
We rest your hermits.,17
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose,17
And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him,17
We are your guest to-night.,17
Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt,17
Still to return your own.,17
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,17
By your leave hostess.,17
SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.,17
If it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well,17
Could trammel up the consequence and catch,17
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,17
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases,17
Bloody instructions which being taught return,17
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice,17
First as I am his kinsman and his subject,17
Who should against his murderer shut the door,17
Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been,17
Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against,17
And pity like a naked new-born babe,17
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,17
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur,17
Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself,17
Enter LADY MACBETH,17
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?,17
Know you not he has?,17
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought,17
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,17
Was the hope drunk,17
And wakes it now to look so green and pale,17
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard,17
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that,17
And live a coward in thine own esteem,17
Like the poor cat i' the adage?,17
I dare do all that may become a man;,17
What beast was't then,17
When you durst do it then you were a man;,17
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place,17
They have made themselves and that their fitness now,17
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:,17
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,17
Have done to this.,17
We fail!,17
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--,17
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains,17
That memory the warder of the brain,17
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep,17
What cannot you and I perform upon,17
His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt,17
Bring forth men-children only;,17
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,17
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,17
Who dares receive it other,17
Upon his death?,17
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.,17
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.,17
ACT II,17
Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him,17
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.,17
I take't 'tis later sir.,17
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.,17
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,17
Gives way to in repose!,17
Give me my sword.,17
A friend.,17
He hath been in unusual pleasure and,17
This diamond he greets your wife withal,17
In measureless content.,17
Our will became the servant to defect;,17
All's well.,17
To you they have show'd some truth.,17
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve,17
If you would grant the time.,17
If you shall cleave to my consent when 'tis,17
So I lose none,17
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,17
Good repose the while!,17
Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE,17
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.,17
Is this a dagger which I see before me,17
I have thee not and yet I see thee still.,17
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but,17
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?,17
As this which now I draw.,17
And such an instrument I was to use.,17
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,17
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:,17
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld,17
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates,17
Alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf,17
With Tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design,17
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear,17
And take the present horror from the time,17
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.,17
I go and it is done; the bell invites me.,17
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.,17
SCENE II. The same.,17
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;,17
Hark! Peace!,17
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:,17
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd,17
That death and nature do contend about them,17
[Within]  Who's there? what ho!,17
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed,17
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled,17
Enter MACBETH,17
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?,17
Did not you speak?,17
Now.,17
Ay.,17
Who lies i' the second chamber?,17
This is a sorry sight.,17
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight.,17
Murder!',17
But they did say their prayers and address'd them,17
There are two lodged together.,17
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.,17
When they did say 'God bless us!',17
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?,17
Stuck in my throat.,17
After these ways; so it will make us mad.,17
Macbeth does murder sleep' the innocent sleep,17
The death of each day's life sore labour's bath,17
Chief nourisher in life's feast--,17
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:,17
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.',17
You do unbend your noble strength to think,17
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.,17
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear,17
I'll go no more:,17
Look on't again I dare not.,17
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead,17
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,17
For it must seem their guilt.,17
Whence is that knocking?,17
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.,17
Clean from my hand? No this my hand will rather,17
Making the green one red.,17
My hands are of your colour; but I shame,17
Knocking within,17
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;,17
How easy is it then! Your constancy,17
Knocking within,17
Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us,17
So poorly in your thoughts.,17
Knocking within,17
Exeunt,17
Knocking within. Enter a Porter,17
man were porter of hell-gate he should have,17
Knocking within,17
knock knock! Who's there i' the name of,17
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in,17
you'll sweat for't.,17
Knock,17
name? Faith here's an equivocator that could,17
who committed treason enough for God's sake,17
in equivocator.,17
Knock,17
English tailor come hither for stealing out of,17
roast your goose.,17
Knock,17
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter,17
some of all professions that go the primrose,17
Knocking within,17
Opens the gate,17
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed,17
Faith sir we were carousing till the,17
provoker of three things.,17
Marry sir nose-painting sleep and,17
it provokes the desire but it takes,17
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:,17
him on and it takes him off; it persuades him,17
not stand to; in conclusion equivocates him,17
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.,17
me: but I requited him for his lie; and I,17
up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast,17
Is thy master stirring?,17
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.,17
Good morrow both.,17
Not yet.,17
I have almost slipp'd the hour.,17
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;,17
The labour we delight in physics pain.,17
I'll make so bold to call,17
Exit,17
He does: he did appoint so.,17
Our chimneys were blown down; and as they say,17
And prophesying with accents terrible,17
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird,17
Was feverous and did shake.,17
My young remembrance cannot parallel,17
Re-enter MACDUFF,17
Cannot conceive nor name thee!,17
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!,17
The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence,17
What is 't you say? the life?,17
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight,17
See and then speak yourselves.,17
Awake awake!,17
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!,17
And look on death itself! up up and see,17
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites,17
Bell rings,17
What's the business,17
The sleepers of the house? speak speak!,17
Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:,17
Would murder as it fell.,17
O Banquo Banquo,17
Woe alas!,17
Too cruel any where.,17
And say it is not so.,17
Had I but died an hour before this chance,17
There 's nothing serious in mortality:,17
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees,17
Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN,17
You are and do not know't:,17
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.,17
O by whom?,17
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;,17
Upon their pillows:,17
Was to be trusted with them.,17
That I did kill them.,17
Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious,17
The expedition my violent love,17
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;,17
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there the murderers,17
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,17
Courage to make 's love kno wn?,17
Look to the lady.,17
That most may claim this argument for ours?,17
where our fate,17
Let 's away;,17
[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow,17
Look to the lady:,17
And when we have our naked frailties hid,17
And question this most bloody piece of work,17
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence,17
Of treasonous malice.,17
So all.,17
And meet i' the hall together.,17
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.,17
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office,17
To Ireland I; our separated fortune,17
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,17
This murderous shaft that's shot,17
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;,17
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft,17
Exeunt,17
Enter ROSS and an old Man,17
Within the volume of which time I have seen,17
Hath trifled former knowings.,17
Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act,17
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:,17
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,17
Tis unnatural,17
A falcon towering in her pride of place,17
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--,17
Turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out,17
War with mankind.,17
They did so to the amazement of mine eyes,17
Enter MACDUFF,17
Why see you not?,17
Those that Macbeth hath slain.,17
What good could they pretend?,17
Malcolm and Donalbain the king's two sons,17
Suspicion of the deed.,17
Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up,17
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.,17
To be invested.,17
Carried to Colmekill,17
And guardian of their bones.,17
No cousin I'll to Fife.,17
Well may you see things well done there: adieu!,17
Farewell father.,17
That would make good of bad and friends of foes!,17
ACT III,17
Enter BANQUO,17
As the weird women promised and I fear,17
It should not stand in thy posterity,17
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--,17
Why by the verities on thee made good,17
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.,17
Here's our chief guest.,17
It had been as a gap in our great feast,17
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,17
Let your highness,17
Are with a most indissoluble tie,17
Ride you this afternoon?,17
We should have else desired your good advice,17
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.,17
As far my lord as will fill up the time,17
I must become a borrower of the night,17
Fail not our feast.,17
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd,17
Their cruel parricide filling their hearers,17
When therewithal we shall have cause of state,17
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?,17
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;,17
Exit BANQUO,17
Till seven at night: to make society,17
Till supper-time alone: while then God be with you!,17
Sirrah a word with you: attend those men,17
They are my lord without the palace gate.,17
Exit Attendant,17
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo,17
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;,17
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour,17
Whose being I do fear: and under him,17
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters,17
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like,17
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,17
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,17
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;,17
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace,17
Given to the common enemy of man,17
Rather than so come fate into the list.,17
Re-enter Attendant with two Murderers,17
Exit Attendant,17
It was so please your highness.,17
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know,17
So under fortune which you thought had been,17
In our last conference pass'd in probation with you,17
the instruments,17
To half a soul and to a notion crazed,17
You made it known to us.,17
Our point of second meeting. Do you find,17
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd,17
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave,17
We are men my liege.,17
As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs,17
All by the name of dogs: the valued file,17
The housekeeper the hunter every one,17
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive,17
That writes them all alike: and so of men.,17
Not i' the worst rank of manhood say 't;,17
Whose execution takes your enemy off,17
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,17
I am one my liege,17
Have so incensed that I am reckless what,17
And I another,17
That I would set my lie on any chance,17
Both of you,17
True my lord.,17
That every minute of his being thrusts,17
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight,17
For certain friends that are both his and mine,17
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,17
Masking the business from the common eye,17
We shall my lord,17
Though our lives--,17
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;,17
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,17
That I require a clearness: and with him--,17
Fleance his son that keeps him company,17
Than is his father's must embrace the fate,17
I'll come to you anon.,17
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.,17
It is concluded. Banquo thy soul's flight,17
Exit,17
Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant,17
Ay madam but returns again to-night.,17
For a few words.,17
Exit,17
Where our desire is got without content:,17
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.,17
How now my lord! why do you keep alone,17
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died,17
Should be without regard: what's done is done.,17
She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice,17
But let the frame of things disjoint both the,17
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep,17
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,17
Than on the torture of the mind to lie,17
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;,17
Malice domestic foreign levy nothing,17
Come on;,17
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.,17
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;,17
Unsafe the while that we,17
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,17
You must leave this.,17
Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.,17
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;,17
His cloister'd flight ere to black Hecate's summons,17
Hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done,17
What's to be done?,17
Till thou applaud the deed. Come seeling night,17
And with thy bloody and invisible hand,17
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow,17
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;,17
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;,17
So prithee go with me.,17
SCENE III. A park near the palace.,17
But who did bid thee join with us?,17
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers,17
To the direction just.,17
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:,17
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches,17
Hark! I hear horses.,17
Then 'tis he: the rest,17
Already are i' the court.,17
Almost a mile: but he does usually,17
Make it their walk.,17
Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE with a torch,17
Stand to't.,17
Let it come down.,17
O treachery! Fly good Fleance fly fly fly!,17
Dies. FLEANCE escapes,17
Wast not the way?,17
We have lost,17
Well let's away and say how much is done.,17
SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.,17
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first,17
Thanks to your majesty.,17
And play the humble host.,17
We will require her welcome.,17
For my heart speaks they are welcome.,17
See they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.,17
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure,17
Approaching the door,17
Tis Banquo's then.,17
Is he dispatch'd?,17
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good,17
Thou art the nonpareil.,17
Fleance is 'scaped.,17
Whole as the marble founded as the rock,17
But now I am cabin'd cribb'd confined bound in,17
Ay my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,17
The least a death to nature.,17
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled,17
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow,17
Exit Murderer,17
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold,17
Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;,17
Meeting were bare without it.,17
Now good digestion wait on appetite,17
May't please your highness sit.,17
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,17
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness,17
His absence sir,17
To grace us with your royal company.,17
Here is a place reserved sir.,17
Here my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?,17
What my good lord?,17
Thy gory locks at me.,17
Sit worthy friends: my lord is often thus,17
The fit is momentary; upon a thought,17
You shall offend him and extend his passion:,17
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that,17
O proper stuff!,17
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,17
Impostors to true fear would well become,17
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!,17
You look but on a stool.,17
how say you?,17
If charnel-houses and our graves must send,17
Shall be the maws of kites.,17
What quite unmann'd in folly?,17
Fie for shame!,17
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;,17
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,17
And there an end; but now they rise again,17
And push us from our stools: this is more strange,17
My worthy lord,17
I do forget.,17
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing,17
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.,17
And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss;,17
And all to all.,17
Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO,17
Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold;,17
Which thou dost glare with!,17
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;,17
What man dare I dare:,17
The arm'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger;,17
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,17
If trembling I inhabit then protest me,17
Unreal mockery hence!,17
Why so: being gone,17
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting,17
Can such things be,17
Without our special wonder? You make me strange,17
When now I think you can behold such sights,17
When mine is blanched with fear.,17
I pray you speak not; he grows worse and worse;,17
Stand not upon the order of your going,17
Good night; and better health,17
A kind good night to all!,17
It will have blood; they say blood will have blood:,17
Augurs and understood relations have,17
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?,17
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person,17
Did you send to him sir?,17
There's not a one of them but in his house,17
And betimes I will to the weird sisters:,17
By the worst means the worst. For mine own good,17
Stepp'd in so far that should I wade no more,17
Strange things I have in head that will to hand;,17
You lack the season of all natures sleep.,17
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:,17
Exeunt,17
Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE,17
Have I not reason beldams as you are,17
To trade and traffic with Macbeth,17
And I the mistress of your charms,17
Was never call'd to bear my part,17
And which is worse all you have done,17
Spiteful and wrathful who as others do,17
But make amends now: get you gone,17
Meet me i' the morning: thither he,17
Your vessels and your spells provide,17
I am for the air; this night I'll spend,17
Great business must be wrought ere noon:,17
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;,17
And that distill'd by magic sleights,17
As by the strength of their illusion,17
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear,17
And you all know security,17
Music and a song within: 'Come away come away'  and c,17
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.,17
Come let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.,17
SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.,17
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,17
Things have been strangely borne. The,17
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:,17
Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kill'd,17
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous,17
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!,17
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,17
Was not that nobly done? Ay and wisely too;,17
To hear the men deny't. So that I say,17
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--,17
should find,17
But peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd,17
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir can you tell,17
The son of Duncan,17
Lives in the English court and is received,17
That the malevolence of fortune nothing,17
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid,17
That by the help of these--with Him above,17
Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights,17
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:,17
Hath so exasperate the king that he,17
Sent he to Macduff?,17
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,17
That clogs me with this answer.',17
Advise him to a caution to hold what distance,17
Fly to the court of England and unfold,17
May soon return to this our suffering country,17
I'll send my prayers with him.,17
ACT IV,17
Thunder. Enter the three Witches,17
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.,17
Round about the cauldron go;,17
Toad that under cold stone,17
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,17
Double double toil and trouble;,17
Fillet of a fenny snake,17
Eye of newt and toe of frog,17
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,17
For a charm of powerful trouble,17
Double double toil and trouble;,17
Scale of dragon tooth of wolf,17
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,17
Liver of blaspheming Jew,17
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,17
Finger of birth-strangled babe,17
Make the gruel thick and slab:,17
For the ingredients of our cauldron.,17
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.,17
Then the charm is firm and good.,17
O well done! I commend your pains;,17
And now about the cauldron sing,17
Enchanting all that you put in.,17
HECATE retires,17
Something wicked this way comes.,17
Whoever knocks!,17
How now you secret black and midnight hags!,17
A deed without a name.,17
Howe'er you come to know it answer me:,17
Against the churches; though the yesty waves,17
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;,17
Though palaces and pyramids do slope,17
Of nature's germens tumble all together,17
To what I ask you.,17
Demand.,17
Say if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,17
Call 'em; let me see 'em.,17
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten,17
Into the flame.,17
Thyself and office deftly show!,17
Tell me thou unknown power--,17
Hear his speech but say thou nought.,17
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.,17
Whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks;,17
word more--,17
More potent than the first.,17
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!,17
Be bloody bold and resolute; laugh to scorn,17
Shall harm Macbeth.,17
Then live Macduff: what need I fear of thee?,17
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;,17
And sleep in spite of thunder.,17
What is this,17
And wears upon his baby-brow the round,17
Listen but speak not to't.,17
Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are:,17
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill,17
Descends,17
Who can impress the forest bid the tree,17
Rebellion's head rise never till the wood,17
Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath,17
Throbs to know one thing: tell me if your art,17
Reign in this kingdom?,17
I will be satisfied: deny me this,17
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?,17
Show!,17
Show!,17
Come like shadows so depart!,17
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!,17
Thou other gold-bound brow is like the first.,17
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start eyes!,17
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:,17
Which shows me many more; and some I see,17
Horrible sight! Now I see 'tis true;,17
And points at them for his.,17
What is this so?,17
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?,17
And show the best of our delights:,17
While you perform your antic round:,17
Our duties did his welcome pay.,17
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour,17
Come in without there!,17
What's your grace's will?,17
No my lord.,17
No indeed my lord.,17
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear,17
Tis two or three my lord that bring you word,17
Fled to England!,17
Time thou anticipatest my dread exploits:,17
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment,17
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,17
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;,17
His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls,17
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.,17
Come bring me where they are.,17
SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.,17
What had he done to make him fly the land?,17
He had none:,17
Our fears do make us traitors.,17
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.,17
His mansion and his titles in a place,17
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,17
Her young ones in her nest against the owl.,17
As little is the wisdom where the flight,17
My dearest coz,17
He is noble wise judicious and best knows,17
much further;,17
And do not know ourselves when we hold rumour,17
But float upon a wild and violent sea,17
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:,17
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,17
Father'd he is and yet he's fatherless.,17
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:,17
Exit,17
And what will you do now? How will you live?,17
What with worms and flies?,17
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,17
Why should I mother? Poor birds they are not set for.,17
Yes he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?,17
Why I can buy me twenty at any market.,17
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet i' faith,17
Was my father a traitor mother?,17
What is a traitor?,17
And be all traitors that do so?,17
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?,17
Who must hang them?,17
Then the liars and swearers are fools,17
the honest men and hang up them.,17
But how wilt thou do for a father?,17
him: if you would not it were a good sign,17
Poor prattler how thou talk'st!,17
Bless you fair dame! I am not to you known,17
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:,17
Be not found here; hence with your little ones.,17
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,17
I dare abide no longer.,17
Whither should I fly?,17
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm,17
Accounted dangerous folly: why then alas,17
To say I have done no harm?,17
What are these faces?,17
I hope in no place so unsanctified,17
He's a traitor.,17
What you egg!,17
Young fry of treachery!,17
Run away I pray you!,17
Exit LADY MACDUFF crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers following her,17
Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF,17
Weep our sad bosoms empty.,17
Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men,17
New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows,17
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out,17
What I believe I'll wail,17
As I shall find the time to friend I will.,17
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues,17
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;,17
You may deserve of him through me and wisdom,17
To appease an angry god.,17
But Macbeth is.,17
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave,17
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:,17
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,17
I have lost my hopes.,17
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,17
Without leave-taking? I pray you,17
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,17
Bleed bleed poor country!,17
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou,17
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well lord:,17
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,17
Be not offended:,17
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;,17
Is added to her wounds: I think withal,17
And here from gracious England have I offer,17
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,17
Shall have more vices than it had before,17
By him that shall succeed.,17
It is myself I mean: in whom I know,17
That when they shall be open'd black Macbeth,17
Esteem him as a lamb being compared,17
Not in the legions,17
In evils to top Macbeth.,17
Luxurious avaricious false deceitful,17
That has a name: but there's no bottom none,17
Your matrons and your maids could not fill up,17
All continent impediments would o'erbear,17
Than such an one to reign.,17
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been,17
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet,17
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,17
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be,17
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,17
With this there grows,17
A stanchless avarice that were I king,17
Desire his jewels and this other's house:,17
To make me hunger more; that I should forge,17
Destroying them for wealth.,17
Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root,17
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;,17
Of your mere own: all these are portable,17
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,17
Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness,17
I have no relish of them but abound,17
Acting it many ways. Nay had I power I should,17
Uproar the universal peace confound,17
O Scotland Scotland!,17
I am as I have spoken.,17
No not to live. O nation miserable,17
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,17
By his own interdiction stands accursed,17
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,17
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!,17
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,17
Macduff this noble passion,17
Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts,17
By many of these trains hath sought to win me,17
From over-credulous haste: but God above,17
I put myself to thy direction and,17
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,17
Unknown to woman never was forsworn,17
At no time broke my faith would not betray,17
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking,17
Is thine and my poor country's to command:,17
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,17
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness,17
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once,17
Enter a Doctor,17
Ay sir; there are a crew of wretched souls,17
The great assay of art; but at his touch--,17
They presently amend.,17
Exit Doctor,17
Tis call'd the evil:,17
Which often since my here-remain in England,17
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,17
The mere despair of surgery he cures,17
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,17
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,17
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,17
Enter ROSS,17
My countryman; but yet I know him not.,17
I know him now. Good God betimes remove,17
Sir amen.,17
Alas poor country!,17
Be call'd our mother but our grave; where nothing,17
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,17
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell,17
Expire before the flowers in their caps,17
O relation,17
What's the newest grief?,17
Each minute teems a new one.,17
Why well.,17
Well too.,17
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.,17
When I came hither to transport the tidings,17
Of many worthy fellows that were out;,17
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:,17
Would create soldiers make our women fight,17
Be't their comfort,17
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;,17
That Christendom gives out.,17
This comfort with the like! But I have words,17
Where hearing should not latch them.,17
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief,17
No mind that's honest,17
Pertains to you alone.,17
Keep it not from me quickly let me have it.,17
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound,17
Hum! I guess at it.,17
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,17
To add the death of you.,17
What man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;,17
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.,17
Wife children servants all,17
And I must be from thence!,17
I have said.,17
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,17
He has no children. All my pretty ones?,17
What all my pretty chickens and their dam,17
Dispute it like a man.,17
But I must also feel it as a man:,17
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,17
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,17
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!,17
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart enrage it.,17
And braggart with my tongue! But gentle heavens,17
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;,17
Heaven forgive him too!,17
Come go we to the king; our power is ready;,17
Is ripe for shaking and the powers above,17
The night is long that never finds the day.,17
ACT V,17
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman,17
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?,17
her rise from her bed throw her night-gown upon,17
write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again,17
A great perturbation in nature to receive at once,17
watching! In this slumbery agitation besides her,17
time have you heard her say?,17
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.,17
confirm my speech.,17
Lo you here she comes! This is her very guise;,17
How came she by that light?,17
continually; 'tis her command.,17
Ay but their sense is shut.,17
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus,17
this a quarter of an hour.,17
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from,17
Out damned spot! out I say!--One: two: why,17
lord fie! a soldier and afeard? What need we,17
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man,17
Do you mark that?,17
What will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o',17
this starting.,17
She has spoke what she should not I am sure of,17
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the,17
hand. Oh oh oh!,17
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the,17
Well well well--,17
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known,17
holily in their beds.,17
pale.--I tell you yet again Banquo's buried; he,17
Even so?,17
come come come come give me your hand. What's,17
Exit,17
Directly.,17
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds,17
More needs she the divine than the physician.,17
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,17
My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.,17
Good night good doctor.,17
SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.,17
The English power is near led on by Malcolm,17
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes,17
Excite the mortified man.,17
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.,17
For certain sir he is not: I have a file,17
And many unrough youths that even now,17
What does the tyrant?,17
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him,17
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause,17
Now does he feel,17
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;,17
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title,17
Upon a dwarfish thief.,17
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,17
Itself for being there?,17
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:,17
And with him pour we in our country's purge,17
Or so much as it needs,17
Make we our march towards Birnam.,17
SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.,17
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:,17
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?,17
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:,17
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,17
And mingle with the English epicures:,17
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.,17
The devil damn thee black thou cream-faced loon!,17
There is ten thousand--,17
Soldiers sir.,17
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers patch?,17
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers whey-face?,17
Take thy face hence.,17
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,17
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.,17
Is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf;,17
As honour love obedience troops of friends,17
Curses not loud but deep mouth-honour breath,17
Enter SEYTON,17
What news more?,17
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.,17
Tis not needed yet.,17
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;,17
How does your patient doctor?,17
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,17
Cure her of that.,17
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,17
And with some sweet oblivious antidote,17
Which weighs upon the heart?,17
Must minister to himself.,17
Come put mine armour on; give me my staff.,17
Come sir dispatch. If thou couldst doctor cast,17
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,17
That should applaud again.--Pull't off I say.--,17
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?,17
Makes us hear something.,17
I will not be afraid of death and bane,17
[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,17
Exeunt,17
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM SIWARD and YOUNG  SIWARD MACDUFF MENTEITH CAITHNESS ANGUS LENNOX ROSS and Soldiers marching,17
That chambers will be safe.,17
What wood is this before us?,17
Let every soldier hew him down a bough,17
The numbers of our host and make discovery,17
It shall be done.,17
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure,17
Tis his main hope:,17
Both more and less have given him the revolt,17
Whose hearts are absent too.,17
Attend the true event and put we on,17
The time approaches,17
What we shall say we have and what we owe.,17
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:,17
Exeunt marching,17
Enter MACBETH SEYTON and Soldiers with drum and colours,17
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength,17
Till famine and the ague eat them up:,17
We might have met them dareful beard to beard,17
A cry of women within,17
It is the cry of women my good lord.,17
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;,17
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair,17
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;,17
Cannot once start me.,17
Wherefore was that cry?,17
She should have died hereafter;,17
To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow,17
To the last syllable of recorded time,17
The way to dusty death. Out out brief candle!,17
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,17
Told by an idiot full of sound and fury,17
Enter a Messenger,17
Gracious my lord,17
But know not how to do it.,17
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,17
The wood began to move.,17
Let me endure your wrath if't be not so:,17
I say a moving grove.,17
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,17
I care not if thou dost for me as much.,17
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend,17
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood,17
If this which he avouches does appear,17
I gin to be aweary of the sun,17
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow wind! come wrack!,17
Exeunt,17
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM SIWARD MACDUFF and their Army with boughs,17
And show like those you are. You worthy uncle,17
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we,17
According to our order.,17
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,17
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,17
Exeunt,17
Alarums. Enter MACBETH,17
But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he,17
Am I to fear or none.,17
What is thy name?,17
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name,17
My name's Macbeth.,17
More hateful to mine ear.,17
Thou liest abhorred tyrant; with my sword,17
They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain,17
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn,17
Exit,17
That way the noise is. Tyrant show thy face!,17
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.,17
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou Macbeth,17
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;,17
Seems bruited. Let me find him fortune!,17
Exit. Alarums,17
This way my lord; the castle's gently render'd:,17
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;,17
And little is to do.,17
That strike beside us.,17
Exeunt. Alarums,17
Enter MACBETH,17
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives the gashes,17
Enter MACDUFF,17
Of all men else I have avoided thee:,17
With blood of thine already.,17
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain,17
They fight,17
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air,17
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;,17
To one of woman born.,17
And let the angel whom thou still hast served,17
Untimely ripp'd.,17
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!,17
That palter with us in a double sense;,17
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.,17
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:,17
Painted on a pole and underwrit,17
I will not yield,17
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.,17
And thou opposed being of no woman born,17
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on Macduff,17
Exeunt fighting. Alarums,17
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.,17
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.,17
Your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt:,17
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd,17
But like a man he died.,17
Ay and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow,17
It hath no end.,17
Ay on the front.,17
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,17
And so his knell is knoll'd.,17
And that I'll spend for him.,17
They say he parted well and paid his score:,17
Re-enter MACDUFF with MACBETH's head,17
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:,17
That speak my salutation in their minds;,17
Hail King of Scotland!,17
Flourish,17
Before we reckon with your several loves,17
Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland,17
Which would be planted newly with the time,17
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;,17
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,17
Took off her life; this and what needful else,17
We will perform in measure time and place:,17
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.,17
ACT I,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO ESCALUS Lords and Attendants,18
My lord.,18
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;,18
Exceeds in that the lists of all advice,18
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,18
Our city's institutions and the terms,18
As art and practise hath enriched any,18
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,18
Exit an Attendant,18
For you must know we have with special soul,18
Lent him our terror dress'd him with our love,18
Of our own power: what think you of it?,18
To undergo such ample grace and honour,18
Look where he comes.,18
Always obedient to your grace's will,18
Angelo,18
That to the observer doth thy history,18
Are not thine own so proper as to waste,18
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,18
Did not go forth of us 'twere all alike,18
But to fine issues nor Nature never lends,18
But like a thrifty goddess she determines,18
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech,18
Hold therefore Angelo:--,18
Mortality and mercy in Vienna,18
Though first in question is thy secondary.,18
Now good my lord,18
Before so noble and so great a figure,18
No more evasion:,18
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.,18
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd,18
As time and our concernings shall importune,18
What doth befall you here. So fare you well;,18
Of your commissions.,18
That we may bring you something on the way.,18
Nor need you on mine honour have to do,18
So to enforce or qualify the laws,18
I'll privily away. I love the people,18
Through it do well I do not relish well,18
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion,18
The heavens give safety to your purposes!,18
I thank you. Fare you well.,18
I shall desire you sir to give me leave,18
To look into the bottom of my place:,18
I am not yet instructed.,18
And we may soon our satisfaction have,18
I'll wait upon your honour.,18
SCENE II. A Street.,18
If the duke with the other dukes come not to,18
the dukes fall upon the king.,18
Hungary's!,18
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that,18
one out of the table.,18
Ay that he razed.,18
all the rest from their functions: they put forth,18
the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition,18
I never heard any soldier dislike it.,18
grace was said.,18
What in metre?,18
I think or in any religion.,18
controversy: as for example thou thyself art a,18
Well there went but a pair of shears between us.,18
velvet. Thou art the list.,18
a three-piled piece I warrant thee: I had as lief,18
art piled for a French velvet. Do I speak,18
I think thou dost; and indeed with most painful,18
confession learn to begin thy health; but whilst I,18
I think I have done myself wrong have I not?,18
Behold behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I,18
To what I pray?,18
To three thousand dolours a year.,18
A French crown more.,18
art full of error; I am sound.,18
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;,18
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE,18
Well well; there's one yonder arrested and carried,18
Who's that I pray thee?,18
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.,18
him carried away; and which is more within these,18
But after all this fooling I would not have it so.,18
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam,18
Believe me this may be: he promised to meet me two,18
promise-keeping.,18
speech we had to such a purpose.,18
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.,18
Thus what with the war what with the sweat what,18
custom-shrunk.,18
How now! what's the news with you?,18
Well; what has he done?,18
But what's his offence?,18
What is there a maid with child by him?,18
not heard of the proclamation have you?,18
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.,18
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,18
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be,18
To the ground mistress.,18
What shall become of me?,18
clients: though you change your place you need not,18
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that,18
will be considered.,18
Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to,18
Exeunt,18
Fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world?,18
I do it not in evil disposition,18
Thus can the demigod Authority,18
The words of heaven; on whom it will it will;,18
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen,18
From too much liberty my Lucio liberty:,18
So every scope by the immoderate use,18
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,18
If could speak so wisely under an arrest I would,18
the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom,18
offence Claudio?,18
What is't murder?,18
Lechery?,18
Away sir! you must go.,18
A hundred if they'll do you any good.,18
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract,18
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,18
Of outward order: this we came not to,18
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,18
Till time had made them for us. But it chances,18
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.,18
Unhappily even so.,18
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,18
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,18
He can command lets it straight feel the spur;,18
Or in his emmence that fills it up,18
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties,18
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,18
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act,18
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on,18
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to,18
I have done so but he's not to be found.,18
This day my sister should the cloister enter,18
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:,18
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:,18
There is a prone and speechless dialect,18
When she will play with reason and discourse,18
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the,18
imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I,18
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.,18
Within two hours.,18
Exeunt,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS,18
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love,18
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose,18
Of burning youth.,18
My holy sir none better knows than you,18
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies,18
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,18
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,18
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,18
You will demand of me why I do this?,18
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.,18
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;,18
That goes not out to prey. Now as fond fathers,18
Only to stick it in their children's sight,18
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,18
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;,18
Goes all decorum.,18
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:,18
Than in Lord Angelo.,18
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,18
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,18
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed my father,18
Who may in the ambush of my name strike home,18
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,18
Visit both prince and people: therefore I prithee,18
How I may formally in person bear me,18
At our more leisure shall I render you;,18
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses,18
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,18
Exeunt,18
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA,18
Are not these large enough?,18
But rather wishing a more strict restraint,18
[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!,18
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,18
You may I may not; you are yet unsworn.,18
But in the presence of the prioress:,18
Or if you show your face you must not speak.,18
Exit,18
Enter LUCIO,18
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me,18
A novice of this place and the fair sister,18
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,18
I am that Isabella and his sister.,18
Not to be weary with you he's in prison.,18
For that which if myself might be his judge,18
He hath got his friend with child.,18
It is true.,18
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,18
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.,18
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,18
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.,18
Your brother and his lover have embraced:,18
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings,18
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.,18
Is she your cousin?,18
By vain though apt affection.,18
O let him marry her.,18
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;,18
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn,18
His givings-out were of an infinite distance,18
And with full line of his authority,18
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels,18
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge,18
He--to give fear to use and liberty,18
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,18
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;,18
To make him an example. All hope is gone,18
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business,18
Doth he so seek his life?,18
Already; and as I hear the provost hath,18
Alas! what poor ability's in me,18
Assay the power you have.,18
Our doubts are traitors,18
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,18
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,18
As they themselves would owe them.,18
But speedily.,18
No longer staying but to give the mother,18
Commend me to my brother: soon at night,18
I take my leave of you.,18
Exeunt,18
SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.,18
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,18
And let it keep one shape till custom make it,18
Ay but yet,18
Than fall and bruise to death. Alas this gentleman,18
Let but your honour know,18
That in the working of your own affections,18
Or that the resolute acting of your blood,18
Whether you had not sometime in your life,18
And pull'd the law upon you.,18
Another thing to fall. I not deny,18
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two,18
That justice seizes: what know the laws,18
The jewel that we find we stoop and take't,18
We tread upon and never think of it.,18
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,18
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,18
Be it as your wisdom will.,18
Here if it like your honour.,18
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:,18
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.,18
[Aside]  Well heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!,18
Some run from brakes of ice and answer none:,18
Enter ELBOW and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY,18
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in,18
How now sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?,18
constable and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon,18
honour two notorious benefactors.,18
they not malefactors?,18
are: but precise villains they are that I am sure,18
good Christians ought to have.,18
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your,18
He cannot sir; he's out at elbow.,18
He sir! a tapster sir; parcel-bawd; one that,18
say plucked down in the suburbs; and now she,18
How know you that?,18
How? thy wife?,18
Dost thou detest her therefore?,18
she that this house if it be not a bawd's house,18
How dost thou know that constable?,18
cardinally given might have been accused in,18
By the woman's means?,18
spit in his face so she defied him.,18
Prove it before these varlets here thou honourable,18
Do you hear how he misplaces?,18
saving your honour's reverence for stewed prunes;,18
distant time stood as it were in a fruit-dish a,18
such dishes; they are not China dishes but very,18
Go to go to: no matter for the dish sir.,18
the right: but to the point. As I say this,18
being great-bellied and longing as I said for,18
Master Froth here this very man having eaten the,18
honestly; for as you know Master Froth I could,18
No indeed.,18
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes--,18
Why very well; I telling you then if you be,18
cure of the thing you wot of unless they kept very,18
All this is true.,18
Come you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What,18
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.,18
No sir nor I mean it not.,18
leave. And I beseech you look into Master Froth,18
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,18
All-hallond eve.,18
sitting as I say in a lower chair sir; 'twas in,18
to sit have you not?,18
Why very well then; I hope here be truths.,18
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.,18
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.,18
Exit ANGELO,18
Once sir? there was nothing done to her once.,18
I beseech your honour ask me.,18
I beseech you sir look in this gentleman's face.,18
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?,18
Nay; I beseech you mark it well.,18
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?,18
I'll be supposed upon a book his face is the worst,18
worst thing about him how could Master Froth do the,18
your honour.,18
First an it like you the house is a respected,18
mistress is a respected woman.,18
person than any of us all.,18
time has yet to come that she was ever respected,18
Sir she was respected with him before he married with her.,18
this true?,18
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married,18
with me let not your worship think me the poor,18
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.,18
action of slander too.,18
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?,18
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst let him,18
are.,18
wicked varlet now what's come upon thee: thou art,18
Where were you born friend?,18
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?,18
So. What trade are you of sir?,18
Your mistress' name?,18
Hath she had any more than one husband?,18
Nine! Come hither to me Master Froth. Master,18
tapsters: they will draw you Master Froth and you,18
more of you.,18
come into any room in a tap-house but I am drawn,18
Well no more of it Master Froth: farewell.,18
Come you hither to me Master tapster. What's your,18
Pompey.,18
Bum sir.,18
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the,18
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster are you,18
Truly sir I am a poor fellow that would live.,18
do you think of the trade Pompey? is it a lawful trade?,18
But the law will not allow it Pompey; nor it shall,18
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the,18
No Pompey.,18
If your worship will take order for the drabs and,18
There are pretty orders beginning I can tell you:,18
If you head and hang all that offend that way but,18
commission for more heads: if this law hold in,18
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this,18
Thank you good Pompey; and in requital of your,18
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;,18
I shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd,18
have you whipt: so for this time Pompey fare you well.,18
Aside,18
better determine.,18
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.,18
Come hither to me Master Elbow; come hither Master,18
Seven year and a half sir.,18
continued in it some time. You say seven years together?,18
Alas it hath been great pains to you. They do you,18
in your ward sufficient to serve it?,18
are chosen they are glad to choose me for them; I,18
all.,18
the most sufficient of your parish.,18
To my house. Fare you well.,18
What's o'clock think you?,18
I pray you home to dinner with me.,18
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;,18
Lord Angelo is severe.,18
Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;,18
But yet--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.,18
Exeunt,18
Enter Provost and a Servant,18
I'll tell him of you.,18
Exit Servant,18
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,18
All sects all ages smack of this vice; and he,18
Enter ANGELO,18
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?,18
Why dost thou ask again?,18
Under your good correction I have seen,18
Repented o'er his doom.,18
Do you your office or give up your place,18
I crave your honour's pardon.,18
She's very near her hour.,18
To some more fitter place and that with speed.,18
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd,18
Hath he a sister?,18
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,18
Well let her be admitted.,18
See you the fornicatress be removed:,18
There shall be order for't.,18
God save your honour!,18
To ISABELLA,18
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,18
Well; what's your suit?,18
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;,18
For which I must not plead but that I am,18
Well; the matter?,18
I do beseech you let it be his fault,18
[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!,18
Why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:,18
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,18
O just but severe law!,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him,18
Kneel down before him hang upon his gown:,18
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:,18
Must he needs die?,18
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,18
I will not do't.,18
Look what I will not that I cannot do.,18
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse,18
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.,18
Too late? why no; I that do speak a word.,18
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,18
The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,18
As mercy does.,18
You would have slipt like him; but he like you,18
Pray you be gone.,18
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?,18
And what a prisoner.,18
Ay touch him; there's the vein.,18
And you but waste your words.,18
Why all the souls that were were forfeit once;,18
Found out the remedy. How would you be,18
But judge you as you are? O think on that;,18
Like man new made.,18
It is the law not I condemn your brother:,18
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.,18
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens,18
With less respect than we do minister,18
Who is it that hath died for this offence?,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay well said.,18
Those many had not dared to do that evil,18
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake,18
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils,18
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,18
But ere they live to end.,18
I show it most of all when I show justice;,18
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;,18
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;,18
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,18
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.,18
As Jove himself does Jove would ne'er be quiet,18
Would use his heaven for thunder;,18
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,18
Than the soft myrtle: but man proud man,18
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,18
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,18
Would all themselves laugh mortal.,18
will relent;,18
[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!,18
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,18
Thou'rt i' the right girl; more o that.,18
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.,18
Why do you put these sayings upon me?,18
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,18
Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know,18
A natural guiltiness such as is his,18
Against my brother's life.,18
Such sense that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.,18
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.,18
How! bribe me?,18
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.,18
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor,18
That shall be up at heaven and enter there,18
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate,18
Well; come to me to-morrow.,18
Heaven keep your honour safe!,18
For I am that way going to temptation,18
At what hour to-morrow,18
At any time 'fore noon.,18
Exeunt ISABELLA LUCIO and Provost,18
What's this what's this? Is this her fault or mine?,18
Ha!,18
That lying by the violet in the sun,18
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be,18
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,18
And pitch our evils there? O fie fie fie!,18
Dost thou desire her foully for those things,18
Thieves for their robbery have authority,18
That I desire to hear her speak again,18
O cunning enemy that to catch a saint,18
Is that temptation that doth goad us on,18
With all her double vigour art and nature,18
Subdues me quite. Even till now,18
Exit,18
Enter severally DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar and Provost,18
I am the provost. What's your will good friar?,18
I come to visit the afflicted spirits,18
To let me see them and to make me know,18
To them accordingly.,18
Enter JULIET,18
Who falling in the flaws of her own youth,18
And he that got it sentenced; a young man,18
Than die for this.,18
As I do think to-morrow.,18
To JULIET,18
Repent you fair one of the sin you carry?,18
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,18
Or hollowly put on.,18
Love you the man that wrong'd you?,18
So then it seems your most offenceful act,18
Mutually.,18
I do confess it and repent it father.,18
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,18
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,18
I do repent me as it is an evil,18
There rest.,18
And I am going with instruction to him.,18
Exit,18
That respites me a life whose very comfort,18
Tis pity of him.,18
SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.,18
When I would pray and think I think and pray,18
Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue,18
As if I did but only chew his name;,18
Of my conception. The state whereon I studied,18
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea my gravity,18
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,18
How often dost thou with thy case thy habit,18
To thy false seeming! Blood thou art blood:,18
Tis not the devil's crest.,18
How now! who's there?,18
Teach her the way.,18
O heavens!,18
Making both it unable for itself,18
Of necessary fitness?,18
Come all to help him and so stop the air,18
The general subject to a well-wish'd king,18
Crowd to his presence where their untaught love,18
Enter ISABELLA,18
I am come to know your pleasure.,18
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.,18
Yet may he live awhile; and it may be,18
Under your sentence?,18
When I beseech you? that in his reprieve,18
That his soul sicken not.,18
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen,18
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image,18
Falsely to take away a life true made,18
To make a false one.,18
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.,18
Now took your brother's life; or to redeem him,18
As she that he hath stain'd?,18
I had rather give my body than my soul.,18
Stand more for number than for accompt.,18
Nay I'll not warrant that; for I can speak,18
I now the voice of the recorded law,18
Might there not be a charity in sin,18
Please you to do't,18
It is no sin at all but charity.,18
Were equal poise of sin and charity.,18
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,18
To have it added to the faults of mine,18
Nay but hear me.,18
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.,18
But graciously to know I am no better.,18
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks,18
Than beauty could display'd. But mark me;,18
Your brother is to die.,18
And his offence is so as it appears,18
True.,18
As I subscribe not that nor any other,18
Finding yourself desired of such a person,18
Could fetch your brother from the manacles,18
No earthly mean to save him but that either,18
To this supposed or else to let him suffer;,18
As much for my poor brother as myself:,18
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,18
That longing have been sick for ere I'ld yield,18
Then must your brother die.,18
Better it were a brother died at once,18
Should die for ever.,18
That you have slander'd so?,18
Are of two houses: lawful mercy,18
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;,18
A merriment than a vice.,18
To have what we would have we speak not what we mean:,18
For his advantage that I dearly love.,18
Else let my brother die,18
Owe and succeed thy weakness.,18
Ay as the glasses where they view themselves;,18
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar,18
For we are soft as our complexions are,18
I think it well:,18
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger,18
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,18
If you be one as you are well express'd,18
By putting on the destined livery.,18
Let me entreat you speak the former language.,18
My brother did love Juliet,18
He shall not Isabel if you give me love.,18
Which seems a little fouler than it is,18
Believe me on mine honour,18
Ha! little honour to be much believed,18
I will proclaim thee Angelo; look for't:,18
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud,18
Who will believe thee Isabel?,18
My vouch against you and my place i' the state,18
That you shall stifle in your own report,18
And now I give my sensual race the rein:,18
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,18
By yielding up thy body to my will;,18
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out,18
Or by the affection that now guides me most,18
Say what you can my false o'erweighs your true.,18
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,18
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,18
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:,18
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:,18
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.,18
On twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up,18
To such abhorr'd pollution.,18
More than our brother is our chastity.,18
And fit his mind to death for his soul's rest.,18
ACT III,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before CLAUDIO and Provost,18
The miserable have no other medicine,18
I've hope to live and am prepared to die.,18
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:,18
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,18
That dost this habitation where thou keep'st,18
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun,18
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st,18
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork,18
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st,18
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains,18
For what thou hast not still thou strivest to get,18
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,18
For like an ass whose back with ingots bows,18
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;,18
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,18
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,18
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth,18
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,18
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this,18
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,18
I humbly thank you.,18
And seeking death find life: let it come on.,18
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.,18
Most holy sir I thank you.,18
My business is a word or two with Claudio.,18
Provost a word with you.,18
Bring me to hear them speak where I may be concealed.,18
Now sister what's the comfort?,18
As all comforts are; most good most good indeed.,18
Intends you for his swift ambassador,18
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;,18
Is there no remedy?,18
To cleave a heart in twain.,18
Yes brother you may live:,18
If you'll implore it that will free your life,18
Perpetual durance?,18
Though all the world's vastidity you had,18
But in what nature?,18
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,18
Let me know the point.,18
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,18
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?,18
And the poor beetle that we tread upon,18
As when a giant dies.,18
Think you I can a resolution fetch,18
I will encounter darkness as a bride,18
There spake my brother; there my father's grave,18
Thou art too noble to conserve a life,18
Whose settled visage and deliberate word,18
As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil,18
A pond as deep as hell.,18
O 'tis the cunning livery of hell,18
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think Claudio?,18
Thou mightst be freed.,18
Yes he would give't thee from this rank offence,18
That I should do what I abhor to name,18
Thou shalt not do't.,18
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance,18
Thanks dear Isabel.,18
Yes. Has he affections in him,18
When he would force it? Sure it is no sin,18
Which is the least?,18
Why would he for the momentary trick,18
What says my brother?,18
And shamed life a hateful.,18
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;,18
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit,18
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;,18
And blown with restless violence round about,18
Of those that lawless and incertain thought,18
The weariest and most loathed worldly life,18
Can lay on nature is a paradise,18
Alas alas!,18
What sin you do to save a brother's life,18
That it becomes a virtue.,18
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!,18
Is't not a kind of incest to take life,18
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!,18
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!,18
Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed:,18
No word to save thee.,18
O fie fie fie!,18
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:,18
O hear me Isabella!,18
Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word.,18
Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and,18
would require is likewise your own benefit.,18
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.,18
Son I have overheard what hath passed between you,18
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her,18
of natures: she having the truth of honour in her,18
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo and I,18
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes,18
your knees and make ready.,18
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.,18
Exit CLAUDIO,18
Re-enter Provost,18
That now you are come you will be gone. Leave me,18
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.,18
Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward,18
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty,18
your complexion shall keep the body of it ever,18
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and but,18
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this,18
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my,18
unlawfully born. But O how much is the good duke,18
speak to him I will open my lips in vain or,18
That shall not be much amiss: Yet as the matter,18
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my,18
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe,18
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from,18
person; and much please the absent duke if,18
this business.,18
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.,18
you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of,18
I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name.,18
to her by oath and the nuptial appointed: between,18
solemnity her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,18
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the,18
renowned brother in his love toward her ever most,18
her fortune her marriage-dowry; with both her,18
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?,18
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,18
bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet,18
is washed with them but relents not.,18
from the world! What corruption in this life that,18
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the,18
you from dishonour in doing it.,18
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance,18
in all reason should have quenched her love hath,18
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his,18
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to,18
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and,18
This being granted in course--and now follows,18
your appointment go in your place; if the encounter,18
her recompense: and here by this is your brother,18
advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid,18
think well to carry this as you may the doubleness,18
What think you of it?,18
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.,18
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his,18
presently to Saint Luke's: there at the moated,18
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo that,18
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well good father.,18
SCENE II. The street before the prison.,18
Nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will,18
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.,18
Twas never merry world since of two usuries the,18
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and,18
craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing.,18
And you good brother father. What offence hath,18
Marry sir he hath offended the law: and sir we,18
upon him sir a strange picklock which we have,18
Fie sirrah! a bawd a wicked bawd!,18
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think,18
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,18
I drink I eat array myself and live.,18
So stinkingly depending? Go mend go mend.,18
sir I would prove--,18
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison officer:,18
Ere this rude beast will profit.,18
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if,18
as good go a mile on his errand.,18
From our faults as faults from seeming free!,18
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a,18
Enter LUCIO,18
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What is there,18
had now for putting the hand in the pocket and,18
sayest thou to this tune matter and method? Is't,18
thou Trot? Is the world as it was man? Which is,18
trick of it?,18
How doth my dear morsel thy mistress? Procures she,18
Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she,18
Why 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be,18
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going,18
Yes faith sir.,18
sent thee thither. For debt Pompey? or how?,18
Well then imprison him: if imprisonment be the,18
doubtless and of antiquity too; bawd-born.,18
Pompey: you will turn good husband now Pompey; you,18
I hope sir your good worship will be my bail.,18
I will pray Pompey to increase your bondage: If,18
more. Adieu trusty Pompey. 'Bless you friar.,18
Does Bridget paint still Pompey ha?,18
You will not bail me then sir?,18
what news?,18
Go to kennel Pompey; go.,18
What news friar of the duke?,18
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other,18
I know not where; but wheresoever I wish him well.,18
the state and usurp the beggary he was never born,18
puts transgression to 't.,18
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in,18
It is too general a vice and severity must cure it.,18
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp,18
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and,18
true think you?,18
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some that he,18
certain that when he makes water his urine is,18
motion generative; that's infallible.,18
Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the,18
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?,18
hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing,18
knew the service and that instructed him to mercy.,18
women; he was not inclined that way.,18
Tis not possible.,18
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the,18
that let me inform you.,18
Sir I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the,18
withdrawing.,18
No pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the,18
understand the greater file of the subject held the,18
Wise! why no question but he was.,18
Either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking:,18
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better,18
bringings-forth and he shall appear to the,18
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your,18
Sir I know him and I love him.,18
dearer love.,18
I can hardly believe that since you know not what,18
prayers are he may let me desire you to make your,18
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call,18
Sir my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.,18
report you.,18
O you hope the duke will return no more; or you,18
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.,18
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if,18
Why should he die sir?,18
the duke we talk of were returned again: the,18
continency; sparrows must not build in his,18
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would,18
Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.,18
duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on,18
he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown,18
Exit,18
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny,18
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?,18
Enter ESCALUS Provost and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE,18
Good my lord be good to me; your honour is accounted,18
Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in,18
the tyrant.,18
your honour.,18
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the,18
is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob:,18
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be,18
no more words.,18
Provost my brother Angelo will not be altered;,18
with divines and have all charitable preparation.,18
so with him.,18
advised him for the entertainment of death.,18
Bliss and goodness on you!,18
Not of this country though my chance is now,18
Of gracious order late come from the See,18
What news abroad i' the world?,18
goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it:,18
to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous,18
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but,18
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This,18
pray you sir of what disposition was the duke?,18
especially to know himself.,18
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at,18
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to,18
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio,18
lent him visitation.,18
from his judge but most willingly humbles himself,18
to himself by the instruction of his frailty many,18
leisure have discredited to him and now is he,18
You have paid the heavens your function and the,18
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest,18
found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him,18
If his own life answer the straitness of his,18
chance to fail he hath sentenced himself.,18
Peace be with you!,18
He who the sword of heaven will bear,18
Pattern in himself to know,18
More nor less to others paying,18
Shame to him whose cruel striking,18
Twice treble shame on Angelo,18
O what may man within him hide,18
How may likeness made in crimes,18
To draw with idle spiders' strings,18
Craft against vice I must apply:,18
His old betrothed but despised;,18
Pay with falsehood false exacting,18
Exit,18
SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's.,18
Boy sings,18
That so sweetly were forsworn;,18
Lights that do mislead the morn:,18
Seals of love but sealed in vain sealed in vain.,18
Here comes a man of comfort whose advice,18
Exit Boy,18
I cry you mercy sir; and well could wish,18
Let me excuse me and believe me so,18
Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm,18
I pray you tell me hath any body inquired,18
I promised here to meet.,18
I have sat here all day.,18
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even,18
be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself.,18
Exit,18
What is the news from this good deputy?,18
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;,18
That makes his opening with this bigger key:,18
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;,18
Upon the heavy middle of the night,18
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?,18
With whispering and most guilty diligence,18
The way twice o'er.,18
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?,18
And that I have possess'd him my most stay,18
I have a servant comes with me along,18
I come about my brother.,18
I have not yet made known to Mariana,18
Re-enter MARIANA,18
She comes to do you good.,18
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?,18
Take then this your companion by the hand,18
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;,18
Will't please you walk aside?,18
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes,18
Run with these false and most contrarious quests,18
Make thee the father of their idle dreams,18
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA,18
She'll take the enterprise upon her father,18
It is not my consent,18
Little have you to say,18
Remember now my brother.',18
Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all.,18
To bring you thus together 'tis no sin,18
Doth flourish the deceit. Come let us go:,18
Exeunt,18
Enter Provost and POMPEY,18
If the man be a bachelor sir I can; but if he be a,18
cut off a woman's head.,18
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio,18
executioner who in his office lacks a helper: if,18
redeem you from your gyves; if not you shall have,18
with an unpitied whipping for you have been a,18
Sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;,18
would be glad to receive some instruction from my,18
What ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there?,18
Do you call sir?,18
your execution. If you think it meet compound with,18
not use him for the present and dismiss him. He,18
A bawd sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.,18
the scale.,18
Pray sir by your good favour--for surely sir a,18
look--do you call sir your occupation a mystery?,18
Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery; and,18
using painting do prove my occupation a mystery:,18
should be hanged I cannot imagine.,18
Proof?,18
too little for your thief your true man thinks it,18
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's,18
Re-enter Provost,18
Sir I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is,18
oftener ask forgiveness.,18
to-morrow four o'clock.,18
I do desire to learn sir: and I hope if you have,18
me yare; for truly sir for your kindness I owe you,18
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:,18
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,18
Enter CLAUDIO,18
Tis now dead midnight and by eight to-morrow,18
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour,18
He will not wake.,18
Well go prepare yourself.,18
But hark what noise?,18
Exit CLAUDIO,18
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before,18
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night,18
None since the curfew rung.,18
No.,18
What comfort is for Claudio?,18
It is a bitter deputy.,18
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:,18
That in himself which he spurs on his power,18
Which he corrects then were he tyrannous;,18
Knocking within,18
Exit Provost,18
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.,18
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste,18
Re-enter Provost,18
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.,18
But he must die to-morrow?,18
As near the dawning provost as it is,18
Happily,18
No countermand; no such example have we:,18
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear,18
Enter a Messenger,18
And here comes Claudio's pardon.,18
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this,18
smallest article of it neither in time matter or,18
it is almost day.,18
Exit Messenger,18
For which the pardoner himself is in.,18
When it is born in high authority:,18
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.,18
I told you. Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss,18
putting-on; methinks strangely for he hath not used it before.,18
[Reads],18
Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the,18
let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let,18
depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail,18
What say you to this sir?,18
afternoon?,18
that is a prisoner nine years old.,18
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I,18
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,18
Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof.,18
Most manifest and not denied by himself.,18
seems he to be touched?,18
as a drunken sleep; careless reckless and fearless,18
mortality and desperately mortal.,18
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty,18
would not: drunk many times a day if not many days,18
to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming,18
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,18
truly my ancient skill beguiles me; but in the,18
Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is,18
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a,18
for the which you are to do me both a present and a,18
Pray sir in what?,18
A lack how may I do it having the hour limited,18
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case,18
By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my,18
be this morning executed and his head born to Angelo.,18
O death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.,18
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his,18
fall to you upon this more than thanks and good,18
against it with my life.,18
Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy?,18
You will think you have made no offence if the duke,18
But what likelihood is in that?,18
you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor,18
further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you.,18
duke: you know the character I doubt not; and the,18
I know them both.,18
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you,18
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this,18
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering,18
is writ. Look the unfolding star calls up the,18
things should be: all difficulties are but easy,18
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present,18
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.,18
Exeunt,18
Enter POMPEY,18
of profession: one would think it were Mistress,18
customers. First here's young Master Rash; he's in,18
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made,18
much in request for the old women were all dead.,18
Master Three-pile the mercer for some four suits of,18
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy and young,18
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man and young,18
Forthlight the tilter and brave Master Shooty the,18
Pots and I think forty more; all great doers in,18

What ho Barnardine!,18
noise there? What are you?,18
good sir to rise and be put to death.,18
Tell him he must awake and that quickly too.,18
executed and sleep afterwards.,18
He is coming sir he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.,18
Very ready sir.,18
How now Abhorson? what's the news with you?,18
prayers; for look you the warrant's come.,18
fitted for 't.,18
and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the,18
Look you sir; here comes your ghostly father: do,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before,18
you are to depart I am come to advise you comfort,18
Friar not I I have been drinking hard all night,18
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not,18
O sir you must: and therefore I beseech you,18
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's,18
But hear you.,18
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.,18
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!,18
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY,18
Now sir how do you find the prisoner?,18
And to transport him in the mind he is,18
Here in the prison father,18
One Ragozine a most notorious pirate,18
Just of his colour. What if we do omit,18
And satisfy the deputy with the visage,18
O 'tis an accident that heaven provides!,18
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,18
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.,18
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:,18
To save me from the danger that might come,18
Let this be done.,18
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting,18
Your safety manifested.,18
Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo.,18
Now will I write letters to Angelo--,18
Shall witness to him I am near at home,18
To enter publicly: him I'll desire,18
A league below the city; and from thence,18
We shall proceed with Angelo.,18
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.,18
For I would commune with you of such things,18
I'll make all speed.,18
[Within]  Peace ho be here!,18
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:,18
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,18
Enter ISABELLA,18
Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter.,18
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?,18
His head is off and sent to Angelo.,18
It is no other: show your wisdom daughter,18
O I will to him and pluck out his eyes!,18
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!,18
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;,18
Mark what I say which you shall find,18
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay dry your eyes;,18
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried,18
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,18
In that good path that I would wish it go,18
Grace of the duke revenges to your heart,18
I am directed by you.,18
Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:,18
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours,18
Before the duke and to the head of Angelo,18
I am combined by a sacred vow,18
Command these fretting waters from your eyes,18
If I pervert your course. Who's here?,18
Good even. Friar where's the provost?,18
O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see,18
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for,18
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here,18
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been,18
Exit ISABELLA,18
reports; but the best is he lives not in them.,18
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.,18
Nay tarry; I'll go along with thee,18
You have told me too many of him already sir if,18
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.,18
Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it;,18
Sir your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.,18
if bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of,18
Exeunt,18
Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS,18
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions,18
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates and,18
I guess not.,18
entering that if any crave redress of injustice,18
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of,18
hereafter which shall then have no power to stand,18
Well I beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes,18
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet,18
I shall sir. Fare you well.,18
Exit ESCALUS,18
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!,18
The law against it! But that her tender shame,18
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;,18
That no particular scandal once can touch,18
Save that riotous youth with dangerous sense,18
By so receiving a dishonour'd life,18
A lack when once our grace we have forgot,18
Exit,18
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit and FRIAR PETER,18
Giving letters,18
The matter being afoot keep your instruction,18
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,18
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice,18
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;,18
It shall be speeded well.,18
Enter VARRIUS,18
Come we will walk. There's other of our friends,18
Exeunt,18
Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA,18
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,18
He says to veil full purpose.,18
Besides he tells me that if peradventure,18
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic,18
I would Friar Peter--,18
Enter FRIAR PETER,18
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,18
The generous and gravest citizens,18
The duke is entering: therefore hence away!,18
ACT V,18
MARIANA veiled ISABELLA and FRIAR PETER at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO VARRIUS Lords  ANGELO ESCALUS LUCIO Provost Officers and Citizens at several doors,18
Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you.,18
Many and hearty thankings to you both.,18
Such goodness of your justice that our soul,18
Forerunning more requital.,18
O your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,18
When it deserves with characters of brass,18
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,18
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim,18
You must walk by us on our other hand;,18
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward,18
Justice O royal duke! Vail your regard,18
O worthy prince dishonour not your eye,18
Till you have heard me in my true complaint,18
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.,18
Reveal yourself to him.,18
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:,18
Must either punish me not being believed,18
My lord her wits I fear me are not firm:,18
Cut off by course of justice--,18
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.,18
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?,18
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,18
Is it not strange and strange?,18
It is not truer he is Angelo,18
Nay it is ten times true; for truth is truth,18
Away with her! Poor soul,18
O prince I conjure thee as thou believest,18
That thou neglect me not with that opinion,18
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible,18
May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute,18
In all his dressings characts titles forms,18
If he be less he's nothing; but he's more,18
By mine honesty,18
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,18
As e'er I heard in madness.,18
Harp not on that nor do not banish reason,18
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,18
Many that are not mad,18
I am the sister of one Claudio,18
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:,18
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio,18
That's I an't like your grace:,18
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo,18
That's he indeed.,18
No my good lord;,18
I wish you now then;,18
A business for yourself pray heaven you then,18
I warrant your honour.,18
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale--,18
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong,18
I went,18
That's somewhat madly spoken.,18
The phrase is to the matter.,18
In brief to set the needless process by,18
How he refell'd me and how I replied--,18
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:,18
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,18
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,18
His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant,18
This is most likely!,18
By heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st,18
In hateful practise. First his integrity,18
That with such vehemency he should pursue,18
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,18
Confess the truth and say by whose advice,18
And is this all?,18
Keep me in patience and with ripen'd time,18
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,18
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!,18
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall,18
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?,18
A ghostly father belike. Who knows that Lodowick?,18
I do not like the man: had he been lay my lord,18
In your retirement I had swinged him soundly.,18
And to set on this wretched woman here,18
But yesternight my lord she and that friar,18
A very scurvy fellow.,18
I have stood by my lord and I have heard,18
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,18
As she from one ungot.,18
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?,18
Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler,18
And on my trust a man that never yet,18
My lord most villanously; believe it.,18
But at this instant he is sick my lord,18
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint,18
To speak as from his mouth what he doth know,18
And all probation will make up full clear,18
To justify this worthy nobleman,18
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,18
Good friar let's hear it.,18
Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo?,18
Give us some seats. Come cousin Angelo;,18
Of your own cause. Is this the witness friar?,18
Pardon my lord; I will not show my face,18
What are you married?,18
Are you a maid?,18
A widow then?,18
Why you are nothing then: neither maid widow nor wife?,18
neither maid widow nor wife.,18
To prattle for himself.,18
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;,18
I have known my husband; yet my husband,18
He was drunk then my lord: it can be no better.,18
Well my lord.,18
Now I come to't my lord,18
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,18
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,18
Charges she more than me?,18
No? you say your husband.,18
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,18
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.,18
Unveiling,18
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;,18
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body,18
And did supply thee at thy garden-house,18
Know you this woman?,18
Sirrah no more!,18
My lord I must confess I know this woman:,18
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,18
Came short of composition but in chief,18
In levity: since which time of five years,18
Upon my faith and honour.,18
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,18
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly,18
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house,18
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,18
A marble monument!,18
Now good my lord give me the scope of justice,18
These poor informal women are no more,18
That sets them on: let me have way my lord,18
Ay with my heart,18
Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman,18
Though they would swear down each particular saint,18
That's seal'd in approbation? You Lord Escalus,18
To find out this abuse whence 'tis derived.,18
Let him be sent for.,18
Hath set the women on to this complaint:,18
And he may fetch him.,18
Exit Provost,18
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,18
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;,18
Upon these slanderers.,18
Exit DUKE,18
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?,18
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most,18
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and,18
notable fellow.,18
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.,18
Pray you my lord give me leave to question; you,18
Not better than he by her own report.,18
Marry sir I think if you handled her privately,18
she'll be ashamed.,18
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.,18
Come on mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all,18
My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with,18
In very good time: speak not you to him till we,18
Mum.,18
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.,18
How! know you where you are?,18
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!,18
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:,18
Boldly at least. But O poor souls,18
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?,18
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,18
Which here you come to accuse.,18
Why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,18
To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth,18
To call him villain? and then to glance from him,18
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you,18
What 'unjust'!,18
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he,18
Nor here provincial. My business in this state,18
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble,18
But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes,18
As much in mock as mark.,18
What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio?,18
Tis he my lord. Come hither goodman baldpate:,18
I remember you sir by the sound of your voice: I,18
O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?,18
Do you so sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger a,18
You must sir change persons with me ere you make,18
much more much worse.,18
nose for thy speeches?,18
Hark how the villain would close now after his,18
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with,18
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him,18
with the other confederate companion!,18
What resists he? Help him Lucio.,18
bald-pated lying rascal you must be hooded must,18
show your sheep-biting face and be hanged an hour!,18
Pulls off the friar's hood and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO,18
First provost let me bail these gentle three.,18
Sneak not away sir; for the friar and you,18
This may prove worse than hanging.,18
We'll borrow place of him.,18
Sir by your leave.,18
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,18
And hold no longer out.,18
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,18
When I perceive your grace like power divine,18
No longer session hold upon my shame,18
Immediate sentence then and sequent death,18
Come hither Mariana.,18
I was my lord.,18
Do you the office friar; which consummate,18
Exeunt ANGELO MARIANA FRIAR PETER and Provost,18
Than at the strangeness of it.,18
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then,18
Not changing heart with habit I am still,18
O give me pardon,18
Your unknown sovereignty!,18
And now dear maid be you as free to us.,18
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,18
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power,18
It was the swift celerity of his death,18
That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!,18
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,18
I do my lord.,18
For this new-married man approaching here,18
Your well defended honour you must pardon,18
Being criminal in double violation,18
Thereon dependent for your brother's life--,18
Most audible even from his proper tongue,18
Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure;,18
Then Angelo thy fault's thus manifested;,18
We do condemn thee to the very block,18
Away with him!,18
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.,18
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,18
For that he knew you might reproach your life,18
Although by confiscation they are ours,18
To buy you a better husband.,18
I crave no other nor no better man.,18
Gentle my liege--,18
You do but lose your labour.,18
To LUCIO,18
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel take my part;,18
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.,18
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,18
And take her hence in horror.,18
Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me;,18
They say best men are moulded out of faults;,18
For being a little bad: so may my husband.,18
He dies for Claudio's death.,18
Kneeling,18
As if my brother lived: I partly think,18
Till he did look on me: since it is so,18
In that he did the thing for which he died:,18
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,18
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;,18
Merely my lord.,18
I have bethought me of another fault.,18
At an unusual hour?,18
Had you a special warrant for the deed?,18
For which I do discharge you of your office:,18
Pardon me noble lord:,18
Yet did repent me after more advice;,18
That should by private order else have died,18
What's he?,18
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.,18
Exit Provost,18
As you Lord Angelo have still appear'd,18
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.,18
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart,18
Tis my deserving and I do entreat it.,18
Which is that Barnardine?,18
There was a friar told me of this man.,18
That apprehends no further than this world,18
But for those earthly faults I quit them all;,18
For better times to come. Friar advise him;,18
This is another prisoner that I saved.,18
As like almost to Claudio as himself.,18
[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother for his sake,18
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.,18
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;,18
Well Angelo your evil quits you well:,18
I find an apt remission in myself;,18
To LUCIO,18
One all of luxury an ass a madman;,18
That you extol me thus?,18
trick. If you will hang me for it you may; but I,18
Whipt first sir and hanged after.,18
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,18
Whom he begot with child let her appear,18
Let him be whipt and hang'd.,18
Your highness said even now I made you a duke:,18
Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her.,18
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;,18
Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death,18
Slandering a prince deserves it.,18
She Claudio that you wrong'd look you restore.,18
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.,18
There's more behind that is more gratulate.,18
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.,18
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:,18
I have a motion much imports your good;,18
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.,18
What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.,18
ACT I,19
Enter ANTONIO SALARINO and SALANIO,19
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;,19
What stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born,19
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,19
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;,19
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,19
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,19
As they fly by them with their woven wings.,19
The better part of my affections would,19
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,19
And every object that might make me fear,19
Would make me sad.,19
Would blow me to an ague when I thought,19
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,19
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,19
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church,19
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,19
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,19
And in a word but even now worth this,19
To think on this and shall I lack the thought,19
But tell not me; I know Antonio,19
Believe me no: I thank my fortune for it,19
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate,19
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.,19
Fie fie!,19
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy,19
Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Janus,19
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,19
And other of such vinegar aspect,19
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.,19
Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman,19
We leave you now with better company.,19
If worthier friends had not prevented me.,19
I take it your own business calls on you,19
Good morrow my good lords.,19
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?,19
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio,19
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,19
I will not fail you.,19
You have too much respect upon the world:,19
Believe me you are marvellously changed.,19
A stage where every man must play a part,19
Let me play the fool:,19
And let my liver rather heat with wine,19
Why should a man whose blood is warm within,19
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice,19
I love thee and it is my love that speaks--,19
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,19
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion,19
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,19
O my Antonio I do know of these,19
For saying nothing; when I am very sure,19
Which hearing them would call their brothers fools.,19
But fish not with this melancholy bait,19
Come good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:,19
Well we will leave you then till dinner-time:,19
For Gratiano never lets me speak.,19
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.,19
Thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable,19
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO,19
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more,19
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you,19
have them they are not worth the search.,19
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,19
Tis not unknown to you Antonio,19
By something showing a more swelling port,19
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged,19
Is to come fairly off from the great debts,19
Hath left me gaged. To you Antonio,19
And from your love I have a warranty,19
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.,19
And if it stand as you yourself still do,19
My purse my person my extremest means,19
In my school-days when I had lost one shaft,19
The self-same way with more advised watch,19
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,19
I owe you much and like a wilful youth,19
To shoot another arrow that self way,19
As I will watch the aim or to find both,19
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.,19
To wind about my love with circumstance;,19
In making question of my uttermost,19
Then do but say to me what I should do,19
And I am prest unto it: therefore speak.,19
And she is fair and fairer than that word,19
I did receive fair speechless messages:,19
To Cato's daughter Brutus' Portia:,19
For the four winds blow in from every coast,19
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;,19
And many Jasons come in quest of her.,19
To hold a rival place with one of them,19
That I should questionless be fortunate!,19
Neither have I money nor commodity,19
Try what my credit can in Venice do:,19
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.,19
Where money is and I no question make,19
Exeunt,19
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA,19
this great world.,19
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and,19
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It,19
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but,19
Good sentences and well pronounced.,19
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to,19
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that,19
twenty what were good to be done than be one of the,19
devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps,19
youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the,19
choose me a husband. O me the word 'choose!' I may,19
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed,19
Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?,19
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,19
silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning,19
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what,19
these princely suitors that are already come?,19
them I will describe them; and according to my,19
First there is the Neapolitan prince.,19
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great,19
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his,19
Then there is the County Palatine.,19
will not have me choose:' he hears merry tales and,19
philosopher when he grows old being so full of,19
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth,19
two!,19
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man.,19
he! why he hath a horse better than the,19
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a,19
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him I,19
I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I,19
What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron,19
You know I say nothing to him for he understands,19
nor Italian and you will come into the court and,19
He is a proper man's picture but alas who can,19
I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round,19
behavior every where.,19
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he,19
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I,19
under for another.,19
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and,19
he is best he is a little worse than a man and,19
and the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall,19
If he should offer to choose and choose the right,19
will if you should refuse to accept him.,19
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,19
without I know he will choose it. I will do any,19
You need not fear lady the having any of these,19
determinations; which is indeed to return to their,19
you may be won by some other sort than your father's,19
If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as,19
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers,19
but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant,19
Do you not remember lady in your father's time a,19
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?,19
True madam: he of all the men that ever my foolish,19
I remember him well and I remember him worthy of,19
Enter a Serving-man,19
The four strangers seek for you madam to take,19
fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the,19
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a,19
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition,19
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,19
Whiles we shut the gates,19
Exeunt,19
Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK,19
Ay sir for three months.,19
For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound.,19
May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I,19
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.,19
Antonio is a good man.,19
Oh no no no no: my meaning in saying he is a,19
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he,19
Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto he,19
other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships,19
and water-rats water-thieves and land-thieves I,19
winds and rocks. The man is notwithstanding,19
take his bond.,19
I will be assured I may; and that I may be assured,19
If it please you to dine with us.,19
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I,19
walk with you and so following but I will not eat,19
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?,19
This is Signior Antonio.,19
I hate him for he is a Christian,19
He lends out money gratis and brings down,19
If I can catch him once upon the hip,19
He hates our sacred nation and he rails,19
On me my bargains and my well-won thrift,19
If I forgive him!,19
I am debating of my present store,19
I cannot instantly raise up the gross,19
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,19
Do you desire?,19
Rest you fair good signior;,19
Shylock although I neither lend nor borrow,19
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,19
How much ye would?,19
And for three months.,19
Well then your bond; and let me see; but hear you;,19
Upon advantage.,19
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--,19
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,19
And what of him? did he take interest?,19
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.,19
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied,19
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,19
Between these woolly breeders in the act,19
And in the doing of the deed of kind,19
Who then conceiving did in eaning time,19
This was a way to thrive and he was blest:,19
This was a venture sir that Jacob served for;,19
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.,19
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?,19
But note me signior.,19
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.,19
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,19
O what a goodly outside falsehood hath!,19
Three months from twelve; then let me see; the rate--,19
Signior Antonio many a time and oft,19
About my moneys and my usances:,19
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.,19
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,19
Well then it now appears you need my help:,19
Shylock we would have moneys:' you say so;,19
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur,19
What should I say to you? Should I not say,19
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or,19
With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this;,19
You spurn'd me such a day; another time,19
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?,19
To spit on thee again to spurn thee too.,19
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take,19
But lend it rather to thine enemy,19
Exact the penalty.,19
I would be friends with you and have your love,19
Supply your present wants and take no doit,19
This is kind I offer.,19
This kindness will I show.,19
Your single bond; and in a merry sport,19
In such a place such sum or sums as are,19
Be nominated for an equal pound,19
In what part of your body pleaseth me.,19
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.,19
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.,19
Within these two months that's a month before,19
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.,19
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect,19
If he should break his day what should I gain,19
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man,19
As flesh of muttons beefs or goats. I say,19
If he will take it so; if not adieu;,19
Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond.,19
Give him direction for this merry bond,19
See to my house left in the fearful guard,19
I will be with you.,19
Exit Shylock,19
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.,19
My ships come home a month before the day.,19
ACT II,19
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO  and his train; PORTIA NERISSA and others attending,19
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,19
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,19
And let us make incision for your love,19
I tell thee lady this aspect of mine,19
The best-regarded virgins of our clime,19
Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen.,19
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;,19
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:,19
And hedged me by his wit to yield myself,19
Yourself renowned prince then stood as fair,19
For my affection.,19
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets,19
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,19
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,19
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,19
To win thee lady. But alas the while!,19
Which is the better man the greater throw,19
So is Alcides beaten by his page;,19
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,19
You must take your chance,19
Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong,19
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.,19
First forward to the temple: after dinner,19
Good fortune then!,19
Cornets and exeunt,19
Enter LAUNCELOT,19
this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and,19
Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or good Launcelot,19
conscience says 'No; take heed' honest Launcelot;,19
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy,19
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the,19
says the fiend 'and run.' Well my conscience,19
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot being an honest,19
indeed my father did something smack something,19
says 'Launcelot budge not.' 'Budge' says the,19
Conscience' say I 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend',19
conscience I should stay with the Jew my master,19
run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the,19
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil,19
but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel,19
friendly counsel: I will run fiend; my heels are,19
Enter Old GOBBO with a basket,19
to master Jew's?,19
who being more than sand-blind high-gravel blind,19
Master young gentleman I pray you which is the way,19
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but,19
the very next turning turn of no hand but turn,19
By God's sonties 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can,19
that dwells with him dwell with him or no?,19
Aside,19
of young Master Launcelot?,19
though I say it is an honest exceeding poor man,19
Well let his father be what a' will we talk of,19
Your worship's friend and Launcelot sir.,19
talk you of young Master Launcelot?,19
Ergo Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master,19
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd,19
learning is indeed deceased or as you would say,19
Marry God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my,19
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post a staff or,19
Alack the day I know you not young gentleman:,19
soul alive or dead?,19
Alack sir I am sand-blind; I know you not.,19
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his,19
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come,19
may but at the length truth will out.,19
Launcelot my boy.,19
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot your boy,19
be.,19
I know not what I shall think of that: but I am,19
wife is my mother.,19
be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood.,19
got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than,19
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows,19
than I have of my face when I last saw him.,19
master agree? I have brought him a present. How,19
Well well: but for mine own part as I have set,19
have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give,19
his service; you may tell every finger I have with,19
your present to one Master Bassanio who indeed,19
will run as far as God has any ground. O rare,19
am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.,19
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper,19
these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,19
Exit a Servant,19
God bless your worship!,19
Here's my son sir a poor boy--,19
would sir as my father shall specify--,19
Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew,19
His master and he saving your worship's reverence,19
To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having,19
hope an old man shall frutify unto you--,19
your worship and my suit is--,19
your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,19
One speak for both. What would you?,19
That is the very defect of the matter sir.,19
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,19
To leave a rich Jew's service to become,19
The old proverb is very well parted between my,19
God sir and he hath enough.,19
Take leave of thy old master and inquire,19
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.,19
ne'er a tongue in my head. Well if any man in,19
upon a book I shall have good fortune. Go to,19
of wives: alas fifteen wives is nothing! eleven,19
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice and to be,19
here are simple scapes. Well if Fortune be a,19
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.,19
I pray thee good Leonardo think on this:,19
Return in haste for I do feast to-night,19
My best endeavours shall be done herein.,19
Where is your master?,19
Exit,19
Gratiano!,19
You have obtain'd it.,19
Why then you must. But hear thee Gratiano;,19
Parts that become thee happily enough,19
But where thou art not known why there they show,19
To allay with some cold drops of modesty,19
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,19
Signior Bassanio hear me:,19
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,19
Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes,19
Use all the observance of civility,19
To please his grandam never trust me more.,19
Nay but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me,19
No that were pity:,19
Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends,19
I have some business.,19
But we will visit you at supper-time.,19
SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.,19
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:,19
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.,19
And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see,19
Give him this letter; do it secretly;,19
See me in talk with thee.,19
pagan most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play,19
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my,19
Farewell good Launcelot.,19
Alack what heinous sin is it in me,19
But though I am a daughter to his blood,19
If thou keep promise I shall end this strife,19
Exit,19
Enter GRATIANO LORENZO SALARINO and SALANIO,19
Disguise us at my lodging and return,19
We have not made good preparation.,19
Tis vile unless it may be quaintly order'd,19
Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours,19
Enter LAUNCELOT with a letter,19
An it shall please you to break up,19
I know the hand: in faith 'tis a fair hand;,19
Is the fair hand that writ.,19
By your leave sir.,19
Marry sir to bid my old master the,19
Hold here take this: tell gentle Jessica,19
Go gentlemen,19
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?,19
Ay marry I'll be gone about it straight.,19
Meet me and Gratiano,19
Tis good we do so.,19
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?,19
How I shall take her from her father's house,19
What page's suit she hath in readiness.,19
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:,19
Unless she do it under this excuse,19
Come go with me; peruse this as thou goest:,19
Exeunt,19
Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT,19
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--,19
As thou hast done with me:--What Jessica!--,19
Why Jessica I say!,19
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.,19
I could do nothing without bidding.,19
Call you? what is your will?,19
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?,19
But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon,19
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:,19
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.,19
your reproach.,19
An they have conspired together I will not say you,19
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on,19
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four,19
What are there masques? Hear you me Jessica:,19
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,19
Nor thrust your head into the public street,19
But stop my house's ears I mean my casements:,19
My sober house. By Jacob's staff I swear,19
But I will go. Go you before me sirrah;,19
I will go before sir. Mistress look out at,19
boy will be worth a Jewess' eye.,19
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring ha?,19
The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder;,19
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;,19
To one that would have him help to waste,19
Perhaps I will return immediately:,19
Fast bind fast find;,19
Exit,19
I have a father you a daughter lost.,19
SCENE VI. The same.,19
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo,19
His hour is almost past.,19
For lovers ever run before the clock.,19
To seal love's bonds new-made than they are wont,19
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast,19
Where is the horse that doth untread again,19
That he did pace them first? All things that are,19
How like a younker or a prodigal,19
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!,19
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,19
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.,19
Sweet friends your patience for my long abode;,19
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,19
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?,19
Who are you? Tell me for more certainty,19
Lorenzo and thy love.,19
For who love I so much? And now who knows,19
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.,19
I am glad 'tis night you do not look on me,19
But love is blind and lovers cannot see,19
For if they could Cupid himself would blush,19
Descend for you must be my torchbearer.,19
They in themselves good-sooth are too too light.,19
And I should be obscured.,19
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.,19
For the close night doth play the runaway,19
I will make fast the doors and gild myself,19
Exit above,19
Beshrew me but I love her heartily;,19
And fair she is if that mine eyes be true,19
And therefore like herself wise fair and true,19
Enter JESSICA below,19
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.,19
Enter ANTONIO,19
Signior Antonio!,19
Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.,19
Bassanio presently will go aboard:,19
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight,19
Exeunt,19
Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and their trains,19
The several caskets to this noble prince.,19
The first of gold who this inscription bears,19
The second silver which this promise carries,19
This third dull lead with warning all as blunt,19
How shall I know if I do choose the right?,19
If you choose that then I am yours withal.,19
I will survey the inscriptions back again.,19
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.',19
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all,19
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;,19
What says the silver with her virgin hue?,19
As much as he deserves! Pause there Morocco,19
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,19
May not extend so far as to the lady:,19
Were but a weak disabling of myself.,19
I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes,19
But more than these in love I do deserve.,19
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold,19
Why that's the lady; all the world desires her;,19
To kiss this shrine this mortal-breathing saint:,19
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now,19
The watery kingdom whose ambitious head,19
To stop the foreign spirits but they come,19
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.,19
To think so base a thought: it were too gross,19
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,19
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem,19
A coin that bears the figure of an angel,19
But here an angel in a golden bed,19
Here do I choose and thrive I as I may!,19
Then I am yours.,19
O hell! what have we here?,19
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.,19
All that glitters is not gold;,19
Many a man his life hath sold,19
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.,19
Young in limbs in judgment old,19
Fare you well; your suit is cold.,19
Then farewell heat and welcome frost!,19
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.,19
A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains go.,19
Exeunt,19
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO,19
With him is Gratiano gone along;,19
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,19
He came too late the ship was under sail:,19
That in a gondola were seen together,19
Besides Antonio certified the duke,19
I never heard a passion so confused,19
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:,19
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!,19
A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats,19
And jewels two stones two rich and precious stones,19
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.',19
Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats.,19
Or he shall pay for this.,19
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,19
The French and English there miscarried,19
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;,19
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;,19
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.,19
Bassanio told him he would make some speed,19
Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio,19
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,19
Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts,19
As shall conveniently become you there:',19
Turning his face he put his hand behind him,19
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.,19
I pray thee let us go and find him out,19
With some delight or other.,19
Exeunt,19
Enter NERISSA with a Servitor,19
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,19
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON PORTIA and their trains,19
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,19
But if you fail without more speech my lord,19
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:,19
Which casket 'twas I chose; next if I fail,19
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,19
Immediately to leave you and be gone.,19
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.,19
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.,19
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.,19
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.',19
By the fool multitude that choose by show,19
Which pries not to the interior but like the martlet,19
Even in the force and road of casualty.,19
Because I will not jump with common spirits,19
Why then to thee thou silver treasure-house;,19
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:',19
To cozen fortune and be honourable,19
To wear an undeserved dignity.,19
Were not derived corruptly and that clear honour,19
How many then should cover that stand bare!,19
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd,19
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times,19
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.',19
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.,19
Too long a pause for that which you find there.,19
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.,19
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!,19
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?,19
To offend and judge are distinct offices,19
What is here?,19
The fire seven times tried this:,19
That did never choose amiss.,19
Such have but a shadow's bliss:,19
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.,19
I will ever be your head:,19
Still more fool I shall appear,19
With one fool's head I came to woo,19
Sweet adieu. I'll keep my oath,19
Exeunt Arragon and train,19
O these deliberate fools! when they do choose,19
The ancient saying is no heresy,19
Come draw the curtain Nerissa.,19
Where is my lady?,19
Madam there is alighted at your gate,19
To signify the approaching of his lord;,19
To wit besides commends and courteous breath,19
So likely an ambassador of love:,19
To show how costly summer was at hand,19
No more I pray thee: I am half afeard,19
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.,19
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.,19
Exeunt,19
SCENE I. Venice. A street.,19
Now what news on the Rialto?,19
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;,19
dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many,19
Report be an honest woman of her word.,19
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she,19
true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the,19
honest Antonio--O that I had a title good enough,19
Come the full stop.,19
lost a ship.,19
Let me say 'amen' betimes lest the devil cross my,19
Enter SHYLOCK,19
You know none so well none so well as you of my,19
That's certain: I for my part knew the tailor,19
And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was,19
to leave the dam.,19
That's certain if the devil may be her judge.,19
Out upon it old carrion! rebels it at these years?,19
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers,19
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But,19
loss at sea or no?,19
prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the,19
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to,19
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him,19
Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take,19
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,19
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,19
bargains cooled my friends heated mine,19
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands organs,19
the same food hurt with the same weapons subject,19
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as,19
if you tickle us do we not laugh? if you poison,19
revenge? If we are like you in the rest we will,19
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian,19
Christian example? Why revenge. The villany you,19
will better the instruction.,19
Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and,19
We have been up and down to seek him.,19
Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be,19
Exeunt SALANIO SALARINO and Servant,19
found my daughter?,19
Why there there there there! a diamond gone,19
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it,19
precious precious jewels. I would my daughter,19
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in,19
not what's spent in the search: why thou loss upon,19
find the thief; and no satisfaction no revenge:,19
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears,19
Yes other men have ill luck too: Antonio as I,19
What what what? ill luck ill luck?,19
I thank God I thank God. Is't true is't true?,19
I thank thee good Tubal: good news good news!,19
Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard in one,19
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my,19
fourscore ducats!,19
company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.,19
him: I am glad of it.,19
daughter for a monkey.,19
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:,19
But Antonio is certainly undone.,19
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I,19
he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I,19
go good Tubal; at our synagogue Tubal.,19
SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,19
I pray you tarry: pause a day or two,19
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.,19
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,19
But lest you should not understand me well--,19
I would detain you here some month or two,19
How to choose right but I am then forsworn;,19
But if you do you'll make me wish a sin,19
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;,19
Mine own I would say; but if mine then yours,19
Put bars between the owners and their rights!,19
Let fortune go to hell for it not I.,19
To eke it and to draw it out in length,19
Let me choose,19
Upon the rack Bassanio! then confess,19
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,19
There may as well be amity and life,19
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack,19
Promise me life and I'll confess the truth.,19
Confess' and 'love',19
O happy torment when my torturer,19
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.,19
If you do love me you will find me out.,19
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;,19
Fading in music: that the comparison,19
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;,19
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow,19
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day,19
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,19
Than young Alcides when he did redeem,19
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,19
With bleared visages come forth to view,19
Live thou I live: with much much more dismay,19
Music whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself,19
Tell me where is fancy bred,19
How begot how nourished?,19
It is engender'd in the eyes,19
In the cradle where it lies.,19
I'll begin it--Ding dong bell.,19
So may the outward shows be least themselves:,19
In law what plea so tainted and corrupt,19
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,19
Will bless it and approve it with a text,19
There is no vice so simple but assumes,19
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false,19
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;,19
And these assume but valour's excrement,19
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;,19
Making them lightest that wear most of it:,19
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,19
To be the dowry of a second head,19
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore,19
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,19
To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold,19
Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge,19
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,19
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!,19
As doubtful thoughts and rash-embraced despair,19
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,19
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,19
What find I here?,19
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god,19
Or whether riding on the balls of mine,19
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar,19
The painter plays the spider and hath woven,19
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes--,19
Methinks it should have power to steal both his,19
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow,19
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,19
Reads,19
Chance as fair and choose as true!,19
Be content and seek no new,19
And hold your fortune for your bliss,19
And claim her with a loving kiss.,19
I come by note to give and to receive.,19
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,19
Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt,19
So thrice fair lady stand I even so;,19
Until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you.,19
Such as I am: though for myself alone,19
To wish myself much better; yet for you,19
A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich;,19
I might in virtue beauties livings friends,19
Is sum of something which to term in gross,19
Happy in this she is not yet so old,19
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;,19
Commits itself to yours to be directed,19
Myself and what is mine to you and yours,19
Of this fair mansion master of my servants,19
This house these servants and this same myself,19
Which when you part from lose or give away,19
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.,19
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;,19
As after some oration fairly spoke,19
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;,19
Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy,19
Parts from this finger then parts life from hence:,19
My lord and lady it is now our time,19
To cry good joy: good joy my lord and lady!,19
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;,19
And when your honours mean to solemnize,19
Even at that time I may be married too.,19
I thank your lordship you have got me one.,19
You saw the mistress I beheld the maid;,19
No more pertains to me my lord than you.,19
And so did mine too as the matter falls;,19
And sweating until my very roof was dry,19
I got a promise of this fair one here,19
Achieved her mistress.,19
Madam it is so you stand pleased withal.,19
Yes faith my lord.,19
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.,19
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down.,19
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?,19
Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither;,19
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,19
Sweet Portia welcome.,19
They are entirely welcome.,19
My purpose was not to have seen you here;,19
He did entreat me past all saying nay,19
I did my lord;,19
Commends him to you.,19
Ere I ope his letter,19
Not sick my lord unless it be in mind;,19
Will show you his estate.,19
Your hand Salerio: what's the news from Venice?,19
I know he will be glad of our success;,19
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.,19
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:,19
Could turn so much the constitution,19
With leave Bassanio: I am half yourself,19
That this same paper brings you.,19
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words,19
When I did first impart my love to you,19
Ran in my veins I was a gentleman;,19
Rating myself at nothing you shall see,19
My state was nothing I should then have told you,19
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,19
To feed my means. Here is a letter lady;,19
And every word in it a gaping wound,19
Have all his ventures fail'd? What not one hit?,19
From Lisbon Barbary and India?,19
Of merchant-marring rocks?,19
Besides it should appear that if he had,19
He would not take it. Never did I know,19
So keen and greedy to confound a man:,19
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,19
The duke himself and the magnificoes,19
But none can drive him from the envious plea,19
When I was with him I have heard him swear,19
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh,19
That he did owe him: and I know my lord,19
It will go hard with poor Antonio.,19
The dearest friend to me the kindest man,19
In doing courtesies and one in whom,19
Than any that draws breath in Italy.,19
For me three thousand ducats.,19
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond;,19
Before a friend of this description,19
First go with me to church and call me wife,19
For never shall you lie by Portia's side,19
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:,19
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime,19
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:,19
Since you are dear bought I will love you dear.,19
[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio my ships have all,19
very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since,19
debts are cleared between you and I if I might but,19
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,19
O love dispatch all business and be gone!,19
I will make haste: but till I come again,19
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.,19
SCENE III. Venice. A street.,19
Gaoler look to him: tell not me of mercy;,19
Gaoler look to him.,19
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:,19
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;,19
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,19
To come abroad with him at his request.,19
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:,19
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,19
To Christian intercessors. Follow not;,19
Exit,19
That ever kept with men.,19
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.,19
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures,19
Therefore he hates me.,19
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.,19
For the commodity that strangers have,19
Will much impeach the justice of his state;,19
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go:,19
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh,19
Well gaoler on. Pray God Bassanio come,19
Exeunt,19
Enter PORTIA NERISSA LORENZO JESSICA and BALTHASAR,19
You have a noble and a true conceit,19
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.,19
How true a gentleman you send relief,19
I know you would be prouder of the work,19
I never did repent for doing good,19
That do converse and waste the time together,19
There must be needs a like proportion,19
Which makes me think that this Antonio,19
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,19
In purchasing the semblance of my soul,19
This comes too near the praising of myself;,19
Lorenzo I commit into your hands,19
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,19
To live in prayer and contemplation,19
Until her husband and my lord's return:,19
And there will we abide. I do desire you,19
The which my love and some necessity,19
Madam with all my heart;,19
My people do already know my mind,19
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.,19
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!,19
I thank you for your wish and am well pleased,19
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO,19
As I have ever found thee honest-true,19
And use thou all the endeavour of a man,19
Into my cousin's hand Doctor Bellario;,19
Bring them I pray thee with imagined speed,19
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,19
Madam I go with all convenient speed.,19
Come on Nerissa; I have work in hand,19
Before they think of us.,19
They shall Nerissa; but in such a habit,19
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,19
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,19
And speak between the change of man and boy,19
Into a manly stride and speak of frays,19
How honourable ladies sought my love,19
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,19
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,19
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind,19
Which I will practise.,19
Fie what a question's that,19
But come I'll tell thee all my whole device,19
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,19
Exeunt,19
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA,19
are to be laid upon the children: therefore I,19
you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:,19
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do,19
hope neither.,19
Marry you may partly hope that your father got you,19
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed: so the,19
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and,19
fall into Charybdis your mother: well you are,19
I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a,19
Truly the more to blame he: we were Christians,19
another. This making Christians will raise the,19
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.,19
I'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say: here he comes.,19
you thus get my wife into corners.,19
are out. He tells me flatly there is no mercy for,19
says you are no good member of the commonwealth,19
price of pork.,19
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the,19
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:,19
indeed more than I took her for.,19
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,19
parrots. Go in sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.,19
Goodly Lord what a wit-snapper are you! then bid,19
That is done too sir; only 'cover' is the word.,19
Not so sir neither; I know my duty.,19
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray,19
go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table serve,19
For the table sir it shall be served in; for the,19
to dinner sir why let it be as humours and,19
Exit,19
The fool hath planted in his memory,19
A many fools that stand in better place,19
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou Jessica?,19
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?,19
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;,19
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;,19
In reason he should never come to heaven,19
And on the wager lay two earthly women,19
Pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world,19
Even such a husband,19
Nay but ask my opinion too of that.,19
Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach.,19
 Then howso'er thou speak'st 'mong other things,19
Well I'll set you forth.,19
ACT IV,19
Enter the DUKE the Magnificoes ANTONIO BASSANIO GRATIANO SALERIO and others,19
Ready so please your grace.,19
A stony adversary an inhuman wretch,19
From any dram of mercy.,19
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify,19
And that no lawful means can carry me,19
My patience to his fury and am arm'd,19
The very tyranny and rage of his.,19
He is ready at the door: he comes my lord.,19
Make room and let him stand before our face.,19
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice,19
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange,19
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,19
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,19
Forgive a moiety of the principal;,19
That have of late so huddled on his back,19
And pluck commiseration of his state,19
From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd,19
We all expect a gentle answer Jew.,19
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn,19
If you deny it let the danger light,19
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have,19
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:,19
What if my house be troubled with a rat,19
To have it baned? What are you answer'd yet?,19
Some that are mad if they behold a cat;,19
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,19
Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:,19
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;,19
Why he a woollen bagpipe; but of force,19
As to offend himself being offended;,19
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing,19
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?,19
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.,19
Do all men kill the things they do not love?,19
Every offence is not a hate at first.,19
I pray you think you question with the Jew:,19
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;,19
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;,19
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,19
You may as well do anything most hard,19
His Jewish heart: therefore I do beseech you,19
But with all brief and plain conveniency,19
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.,19
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,19
How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none?,19
You have among you many a purchased slave,19
You use in abject and in slavish parts,19
Let them be free marry them to your heirs?,19
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates,19
The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:,19
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.,19
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.,19
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,19
Whom I have sent for to determine this,19
My lord here stays without,19
New come from Padua.,19
Good cheer Antonio! What man courage yet!,19
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.,19
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit,19
You cannot better be employ'd Bassanio,19
Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyer's clerk,19
From both my lord. Bellario greets your grace.,19
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?,19
Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew,19
No not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness,19
No none that thou hast wit enough to make.,19
And for thy life let justice be accused.,19
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,19
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit,19
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,19
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires,19
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,19
Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall,19
This letter from Bellario doth commend,19
Where is he?,19
To know your answer whether you'll admit him.,19
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.,19
[Reads],19
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that,19
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I,19
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er,19
opinion; which bettered with his own learning the,19
with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's,19
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend,19
old a head. I leave him to your gracious,19
commendation.,19
And here I take it is the doctor come.,19
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?,19
You are welcome: take your place.,19
That holds this present question in the court?,19
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew?,19
Is your name Shylock?,19
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;,19
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.,19
Ay so he says.,19
I do.,19
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.,19
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,19
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:,19
The throned monarch better than his crown;,19
The attribute to awe and majesty,19
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;,19
It is an attribute to God himself;,19
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore Jew,19
That in the course of justice none of us,19
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render,19
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;,19
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.,19
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.,19
Yes here I tender it for him in the court;,19
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,19
If this will not suffice it must appear,19
Wrest once the law to your authority:,19
And curb this cruel devil of his will.,19
Can alter a decree established:,19
And many an error by the same example,19
A Daniel come to judgment! yea a Daniel!,19
I pray you let me look upon the bond.,19
Shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.,19
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?,19
Why this bond is forfeit;,19
A pound of flesh to be by him cut off,19
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.,19
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;,19
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,19
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear,19
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.,19
To give the judgment.,19
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.,19
For the intent and purpose of the law,19
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.,19
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!,19
Ay his breast:,19
Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.,19
The flesh?,19
Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge,19
Is it so nominated in the bond?,19
Twere good you do so much for charity.,19
You merchant have you any thing to say?,19
Give me your hand Bassanio: fare you well!,19
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind,19
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,19
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance,19
Commend me to your honourable wife:,19
Say how I loved you speak me fair in death;,19
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.,19
And he repents not that he pays your debt;,19
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.,19
Which is as dear to me as life itself;,19
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:,19
Here to this devil to deliver you.,19
If she were by to hear you make the offer.,19
I would she were in heaven so she could,19
Tis well you offer it behind her back;,19
These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;,19
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!,19
We trifle time: I pray thee pursue sentence.,19
The court awards it and the law doth give it.,19
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:,19
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come prepare!,19
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;,19
Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh;,19
One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods,19
Unto the state of Venice.,19
Is that the law?,19
For as thou urgest justice be assured,19
O learned judge! Mark Jew: a learned judge!,19
And let the Christian go.,19
Soft!,19
He shall have nothing but the penalty.,19
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.,19
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more,19
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,19
Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn,19
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.,19
Now infidel I have you on the hip.,19
Give me my principal and let me go.,19
He hath refused it in the open court:,19
A Daniel still say I a second Daniel!,19
Shall I not have barely my principal?,19
To be so taken at thy peril Jew.,19
I'll stay no longer question.,19
The law hath yet another hold on you.,19
If it be proved against an alien,19
He seek the life of any citizen,19
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half,19
And the offender's life lies in the mercy,19
In which predicament I say thou stand'st;,19
That indirectly and directly too,19
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd,19
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.,19
And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,19
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.,19
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:,19
The other half comes to the general state,19
Ay for the state not for Antonio.,19
You take my house when you do take the prop,19
When you do take the means whereby I live.,19
A halter gratis; nothing else for God's sake.,19
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,19
The other half in use to render it,19
That lately stole his daughter:,19
He presently become a Christian;,19
Here in the court of all he dies possess'd,19
He shall do this or else I do recant,19
Art thou contented Jew? what dost thou say?,19
Clerk draw a deed of gift.,19
I am not well: send the deed after me,19
Get thee gone but do it.,19
Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more,19
Exit SHYLOCK,19
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:,19
And it is meet I presently set forth.,19
Antonio gratify this gentleman,19
Exeunt Duke and his train,19
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted,19
Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew,19
And stand indebted over and above,19
He is well paid that is well satisfied;,19
And therein do account myself well paid:,19
I pray you know me when we meet again:,19
Dear sir of force I must attempt you further:,19
Not as a fee: grant me two things I pray you,19
You press me far and therefore I will yield.,19
Give me your gloves I'll wear them for your sake;,19
And for your love I'll take this ring from you:,19
And you in love shall not deny me this.,19
I will not shame myself to give you this.,19
And now methinks I have a mind to it.,19
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,19
Only for this I pray you pardon me.,19
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks,19
Good sir this ring was given me by my wife;,19
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.,19
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,19
She would not hold out enemy for ever,19
Exeunt Portia and Nerissa,19
Let his deservings and my love withal,19
Go Gratiano run and overtake him;,19
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.,19
Come you and I will thither presently;,19
Fly toward Belmont: come Antonio.,19
SCENE II. The same. A street.,19
Inquire the Jew's house out give him this deed,19
And be a day before our husbands home:,19
Enter GRATIANO,19
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice,19
Your company at dinner.,19
His ring I do accept most thankfully:,19
I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.,19
Sir I would speak with you.,19
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,19
[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst I warrant.,19
That they did give the rings away to men;,19
Aloud,19
Come good sir will you show me to this house?,19
ACT V,19
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA,19
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,19
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,19
Where Cressid lay that night.,19
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew,19
And ran dismay'd away.,19
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand,19
To come again to Carthage.,19
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs,19
In such a night,19
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice,19
In such a night,19
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,19
In such a night,19
Slander her love and he forgave it her.,19
But hark I hear the footing of a man.,19
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?,19
A friend! what friend? your name I pray you friend?,19
My mistress will before the break of day,19
By holy crosses where she kneels and prays,19
Who comes with her?,19
I pray you is my master yet return'd?,19
But go we in I pray thee Jessica,19
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.,19
Sola sola! wo ha ho! sola sola!,19
Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?,19
Leave hollaing man: here.,19
Here.,19
his horn full of good news: my master will be here,19
Exit,19
And yet no matter: why should we go in?,19
Within the house your mistress is at hand;,19
Exit Stephano,19
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music,19
Become the touches of sweet harmony.,19
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:,19
But in his motion like an angel sings,19
Such harmony is in immortal souls;,19
Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it.,19
Come ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!,19
And draw her home with music.,19
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.,19
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,19
Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud,19
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,19
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,19
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet,19
Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage,19
The man that hath no music in himself,19
Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils;,19
And his affections dark as Erebus:,19
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA,19
How far that little candle throws his beams!,19
When the moon shone we did not see the candle.,19
A substitute shines brightly as a king,19
Empties itself as doth an inland brook,19
It is your music madam of the house.,19
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.,19
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,19
The nightingale if she should sing by day,19
No better a musician than the wren.,19
To their right praise and true perfection!,19
And would not be awaked.,19
That is the voice,19
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,19
Dear lady welcome home.,19
Which speed we hope the better for our words.,19
Madam they are not yet;,19
To signify their coming.,19
Give order to my servants that they take,19
Nor you Lorenzo; Jessica nor you.,19
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:,19
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;,19
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.,19
We should hold day with the Antipodes,19
Let me give light but let me not be light;,19
And never be Bassanio so for me:,19
I thank you madam. Give welcome to my friend.,19
To whom I am so infinitely bound.,19
For as I hear he was much bound for you.,19
Sir you are very welcome to our house:,19
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.,19
In faith I gave it to the judge's clerk:,19
Since you do take it love so much at heart.,19
About a hoop of gold a paltry ring,19
For all the world like cutler's poetry,19
What talk you of the posy or the value?,19
That you would wear it till your hour of death,19
Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths,19
Gave it a judge's clerk! no God's my judge,19
He will an if he live to be a man.,19
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,19
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,19
I could not for my heart deny it him.,19
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:,19
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.,19
Never to part with it; and here he stands;,19
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth,19
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:,19
[Aside]  Why I were best to cut my left hand off,19
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away,19
Deserved it too; and then the boy his clerk,19
And neither man nor master would take aught,19
What ring gave you my lord?,19
If I could add a lie unto a fault,19
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.,19
By heaven I will ne'er come in your bed,19
Nor I in yours,19
Sweet Portia,19
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,19
And how unwillingly I left the ring,19
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.,19
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,19
You would not then have parted with the ring.,19
If you had pleased to have defended it,19
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?,19
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.,19
No woman had it but a civil doctor,19
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him,19
Even he that did uphold the very life,19
I was enforced to send it after him;,19
My honour would not let ingratitude,19
For by these blessed candles of the night,19
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.,19
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,19
I will become as liberal as you;,19
No not my body nor my husband's bed:,19
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:,19
Now by mine honour which is yet mine own,19
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised,19
Well do you so; let not me take him then;,19
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.,19
Portia forgive me this enforced wrong;,19
I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes,19
Mark you but that!,19
In each eye one: swear by your double self,19
Nay but hear me:,19
I never more will break an oath with thee.,19
Which but for him that had your husband's ring,19
My soul upon the forfeit that your lord,19
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,19
Here Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.,19
I had it of him: pardon me Bassanio;,19
And pardon me my gentle Gratiano;,19
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.,19
In summer where the ways are fair enough:,19
Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:,19
It comes from Padua from Bellario:,19
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here,19
And even but now return'd; I have not yet,19
And I have better news in store for you,19
There you shall find three of your argosies,19
You shall not know by what strange accident,19
I am dumb.,19
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?,19

For thee to fight    JOHN FALSTAFF',20

unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard,20
conversation that he dares in this manner assay me?,20

Mistress Page! trust me I was going to your house.,20
ill.,20
Faith but you do in my mind.,20
contrary. O Mistress Page give me some counsel!,20
O woman if it were not for one trifling respect I,20
Hang the trifle woman! take the honour. What is,20
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,20
What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights,20

men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised,20
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness that I,20

belly ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged,20
with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted,20
Letter for letter but that the name of Page and,20
of ill opinions here's the twin-brother of thy,20
protest mine never shall. I warrant he hath a,20
different names--sure more--and these are of the,20

Ay marry does he. If he should intend this voyage,20

Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath,20

Well let it not be doubted but he'll come:,20
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?,20

Like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white,20
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,20
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once,20
We two in great amazedness will fly:,20
And fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight,20
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread,20
And till he tell the truth,20
And burn him with their tapers.,20
We'll all present ourselves dis-horn the spirit,20
The children must,20
I will teach the children their behaviors; and I,20

They are gone but to meet the duke villain: do not,20

since I forswore myself at primero. Well if my,20
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY,20
From the two parties forsooth.,20
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more,20
of man's disposition is able to bear.,20
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford good heart,20

beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;,20
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,20

Sure one of you does not serve heaven well that,20
Come up into my chamber.,20
SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.,20
Master Fenton talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I,20
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,20
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.,20
least keep your counsel.,20
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;,20
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,20
Of such contents as you will wonder at;,20
That neither singly can be manifested,20
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest,20
To-night at Herne's oak just 'twixt twelve and one,20
The purpose why is here: in which disguise,20
Her father hath commanded her to slip,20
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now sir,20
And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed,20
While other sports are tasking of their minds,20
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot,20
Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:,20
And in that habit when Slender sees his time,20
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,20
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,20
With ribands pendent flaring 'bout her head;,20
To pinch her by the hand and on that token,20
Which means she to deceive father or mother?,20
And here it rests that you'll procure the vicar,20
And in the lawful name of marrying,20
Well husband your device; I'll to the vicar:,20
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;,20
Exeunt,20
SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.,20
Prithee no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is,20
numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in,20
I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to,20
Away I say; time wears: hold up your head and mince.,20
Enter FORD,20

you had appointed?,20
old man: but I came from her Master Brook like a,20
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,20
you: he beat me grievously in the shape of a,20
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know,20
with me: I'll tell you all Master Brook. Since I,20
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow,20
Ford on whom to-night I will be revenged and I,20
Strange things in hand Master Brook! Follow.,20
SCENE II. Windsor Park.,20
Come come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we,20
my daughter.,20
nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in,20
that we know one another.,20
or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well,20
The night is dark; light and spirits will become it,20
but the devil and we shall know him by his horns.,20
Exeunt,20
Enter MISTRESS PAGE MISTRESS FORD and DOCTOR CAIUS,20
see your time take her by the band away with her,20
into the Park: we two must go together.,20
Fare you well sir.,20
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of,20
my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little,20
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies and the,20
They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,20
Falstaff's and our meeting they will at once,20
That cannot choose but amaze him.,20
amazed he will every way be mocked.,20
Against such lewdsters and their lechery,20
The hour draws on. To the oak to the oak!,20
SCENE IV. Windsor Park.,20
Trib trib fairies; come; and remember your parts:,20
when I give the watch-'ords do as I pid you:,20
Exeunt,20
Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne,20
draws on. Now the hot-blooded gods assist me!,20
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that in some,20
a beast. You were also Jupiter a swan for the love,20
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in,20
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think,20
backs what shall poor men do? For me I am here a,20
forest. Send me a cool rut-time Jove or who can,20
doe?,20
Sir John! art thou there my deer? my male deer?,20
potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green,20
there come a tempest of provocation I will shelter me here.,20
Divide me like a bribe buck each a haunch: I will,20
of this walk and my horns I bequeath your husbands.,20
Why now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes,20
Noise within,20
Heaven forgive our sins,20
Away away!,20
I think the devil will not have me damned lest the,20
never else cross me thus.,20
Fairies black grey green and white,20
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,20
Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes.,20
Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:,20
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:,20
They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:,20
Lies down upon his face,20
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,20
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:,20
Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins.,20
Search Windsor Castle elves within and out:,20
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,20
Worthy the owner and the owner it.,20
With juice of balm and every precious flower:,20
With loyal blazon evermore be blest!,20
Like to the Garter's compass in a ring:,20
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;,20
In emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white;,20
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:,20
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,20
Of Herne the hunter let us not forget.,20
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,20
But stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.,20
transform me to a piece of cheese!,20
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:,20
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,20
A trial come.,20
They burn him with their tapers,20
Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire!,20
And as you trip still pinch him to your time.,20
Fie on sinful fantasy!,20
Lust is but a bloody fire,20
Fed in heart whose flames aspire,20
Pinch him fairies mutually;,20
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,20
During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way and steals away a boy in green;  SLENDER another way and takes off a boy in white;  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.  A noise of hunting is heard within. All the  Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head and rises,20
Nay do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now,20
I pray you come hold up the jest no higher,20
See you these husband? do not these fair yokes,20
Now sir who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,20
horns Master Brook: and Master Brook he hath,20
cudgel and twenty pounds of money which must be,20
it Master Brook.,20
I will never take you for my love again; but I will,20
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.,20
And these are not fairies? I was three or four,20
the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my,20
received belief in despite of the teeth of all,20
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon,20
Sir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your,20
Well said fairy Hugh.,20
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art,20
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that,20
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I,20
with a piece of toasted cheese.,20
Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the,20
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking,20
Why Sir John do you think though we would have the,20
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,20
What a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?,20
Old cold withered and of intolerable entrails?,20
And as poor as Job?,20
And given to fornications and to taverns and sack,20
swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles?,20
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh,20
me as you will.,20
Master Brook that you have cozened of money to,20
that you have suffered I think to repay that money,20
Yet be cheerful knight: thou shalt eat a posset,20
laugh at my wife that now laughs at thee: tell her,20
[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my,20
Enter SLENDER,20
Son how now! how now son! have you dispatched?,20
know on't; would I were hanged la else.,20
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,20
i' the church I would have swinged him or he,20
been Anne Page would I might never stir!--and 'tis,20
Upon my life then you took the wrong.,20
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him for,20
him.,20
you should know my daughter by her garments?,20
cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet,20
Good George be not angry: I knew of your purpose;,20
now with the doctor at the deanery and there married.,20
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar I am cozened: I ha',20
it is not Anne Page: by gar I am cozened.,20
Ay by gar and 'tis a boy: by gar I'll raise all Windsor.,20
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?,20
Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE,20
Pardon good father! good my mother pardon!,20
Why went you not with master doctor maid?,20
You would have married her most shamefully,20
The truth is she and I long since contracted,20
The offence is holy that she hath committed;,20
Of disobedience or unduteous title,20
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,20
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:,20
Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate.,20
strike at me that your arrow hath glanced.,20
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.,20
Well I will muse no further. Master Fenton,20
Good husband let us every one go home,20
Sir John and all.,20
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word,20
Exeunt,20
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.,21
Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour,21
Another moon: but O methinks how slow,21
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,21
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;,21
And then the moon like to a silver bow,21
Of our solemnities.,21
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;,21
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;,21
Exit PHILOSTRATE,21
And won thy love doing thee injuries;,21
With pomp with triumph and with revelling.,21
Happy be Theseus our renowned duke!,21
Full of vexation come I with complaint,21
Stand forth Demetrius. My noble lord,21
Stand forth Lysander: and my gracious duke,21
Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes,21
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,21
And stolen the impression of her fantasy,21
Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers,21
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,21
To stubborn harshness: and my gracious duke,21
Consent to marry with Demetrius,21
As she is mine I may dispose of her:,21
Or to her death according to our law,21
What say you Hermia? be advised fair maid:,21
One that composed your beauties yea and one,21
By him imprinted and within his power,21
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.,21
In himself he is;,21
The other must be held the worthier.,21
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.,21
I know not by what power I am made bold,21
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;,21
The worst that may befall me in this case,21
Either to die the death or to abjure,21
Therefore fair Hermia question your desires;,21
Whether if you yield not to your father's choice,21
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,21
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.,21
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;,21
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn,21
So will I grow so live so die my lord,21
Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke,21
Take time to pause; and by the nest new moon--,21
For everlasting bond of fellowship--,21
For disobedience to your father's will,21
Or on Diana's altar to protest,21
Relent sweet Hermia: and Lysander yield,21
You have her father's love Demetrius;,21
Scornful Lysander! true he hath my love,21
And she is mine and all my right of her,21
I am my lord as well derived as he,21
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,21
And which is more than all these boasts can be,21
Why should not I then prosecute my right?,21
Made love to Nedar's daughter Helena,21
Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry,21
I must confess that I have heard so much,21
But being over-full of self-affairs,21
And come Egeus; you shall go with me,21
For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself,21
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--,21
To death or to a vow of single life.,21
Demetrius and Egeus go along:,21
Against our nuptial and confer with you,21
With duty and desire we follow you.,21
How now my love! why is your cheek so pale?,21
Belike for want of rain which I could well,21
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,21
The course of true love never did run smooth;,21
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.,21
O spite! too old to be engaged to young.,21
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.,21
War death or sickness did lay siege to it,21
Swift as a shadow short as any dream;,21
That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,21
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:,21
If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,21
Then let us teach our trial patience,21
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,21
A good persuasion: therefore hear me Hermia.,21
Of great revenue and she hath no child:,21
And she respects me as her only son.,21
And to that place the sharp Athenian law,21
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;,21
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,21
There will I stay for thee.,21
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,21
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,21
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,21
By all the vows that ever men have broke,21
In that same place thou hast appointed me,21
Keep promise love. Look here comes Helena.,21
God speed fair Helena! whither away?,21
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!,21
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,21
Sickness is catching: O were favour so,21
My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye,21
Were the world mine Demetrius being bated,21
O teach me how you look and with what art,21
I frown upon him yet he loves me still.,21
I give him curses yet he gives me love.,21
The more I hate the more he follows me.,21
His folly Helena is no fault of mine.,21
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;,21
Before the time I did Lysander see,21
O then what graces in my love do dwell,21
Helen to you our minds we will unfold:,21
Her silver visage in the watery glass,21
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,21
And in the wood where often you and I,21
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,21
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,21
Farewell sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;,21
Keep word Lysander: we must starve our sight,21
I will my Hermia.,21
Helena adieu:,21
Exit,21
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.,21
He will not know what all but he do know:,21
So I admiring of his qualities:,21
Love can transpose to form and dignity:,21
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:,21
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:,21
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.,21
So the boy Love is perjured every where:,21
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;,21
So he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt.,21
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night,21
If I have thanks it is a dear expense:,21
To have his sight thither and back again.,21
SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.,21
Is all our company here?,21
according to the scrip.,21
thought fit through all Athens to play in our,21
wedding-day at night.,21
on then read the names of the actors and so grow,21
Marry our play is The most lamentable comedy and,21
A very good piece of work I assure you and a,21
actors by the scroll. Masters spread yourselves.,21
Ready. Name what part I am for and proceed.,21
What is Pyramus? a lover or a tyrant?,21
That will ask some tears in the true performing of,21
eyes; I will move storms I will condole in some,21
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely or a part to,21
The raging rocks,21
Shall break the locks,21
And Phibbus' car,21
And make and mar,21
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.,21
more condoling.,21
Here Peter Quince.,21
What is Thisby? a wandering knight?,21
Nay faith let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.,21
you may speak as small as you will.,21
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,21
and lady dear!',21
Well proceed.,21
Here Peter Quince.,21
Tom Snout the tinker.,21
You Pyramus' father: myself Thisby's father:,21
hope here is a play fitted.,21
be give it me for I am slow of study.,21
Let me play the lion too: I will roar that I will,21
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,21
An you should do it too terribly you would fright,21
and that were enough to hang us all.,21
I grant you friends if that you should fright the,21
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my,21
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any,21
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a,21
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:,21
Well I will undertake it. What beard were I best,21
Why what you will.,21
beard your orange-tawny beard your purple-in-grain,21
perfect yellow.,21
then you will play bare-faced. But masters here,21
you and desire you to con them by to-morrow night;,21
town by moonlight; there will we rehearse for if,21
company and our devices known. In the meantime I,21
wants. I pray you fail me not.,21
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.,21
Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.,21
ACT II,21
Enter from opposite sides a Fairy and PUCK,21
Over hill over dale,21
Over park over pale,21
I do wander everywhere,21
And I serve the fairy queen,21
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:,21
Those be rubies fairy favours,21
I must go seek some dewdrops here,21
Farewell thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:,21
The king doth keep his revels here to-night:,21
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,21
A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;,21
And jealous Oberon would have the child,21
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,21
And now they never meet in grove or green,21
But they do square that all their elves for fear,21
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,21
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he,21
Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern,21
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;,21
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,21
Are not you he?,21
I am that merry wanderer of the night.,21
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,21
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,21
And when she drinks against her lips I bob,21
The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale,21
Then slip I from her bum down topples she,21
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,21
A merrier hour was never wasted there.,21
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!,21
Ill met by moonlight proud Titania.,21
I have forsworn his bed and company.,21
Then I must be thy lady: but I know,21
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,21
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,21
But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon,21
To Theseus must be wedded and you come,21
How canst thou thus for shame Titania,21
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?,21
From Perigenia whom he ravished?,21
With Ariadne and Antiopa?,21
And never since the middle summer's spring,21
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,21
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,21
Therefore the winds piping to us in vain,21
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land,21
That they have overborne their continents:,21
The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn,21
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,21
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,21
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:,21
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:,21
Pale in her anger washes all the air,21
And thorough this distemperature we see,21
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,21
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds,21
The childing autumn angry winter change,21
By their increase now knows not which is which:,21
From our debate from our dissension;,21
Do you amend it then; it lies in you:,21
I do but beg a little changeling boy,21
Set your heart at rest:,21
His mother was a votaress of my order:,21
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,21
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,21
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;,21
Following--her womb then rich with my young squire--,21
To fetch me trifles and return again,21
But she being mortal of that boy did die;,21
And for her sake I will not part with him.,21
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.,21
And see our moonlight revels go with us;,21
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.,21
We shall chide downright if I longer stay.,21
Well go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove,21
My gentle Puck come hither. Thou rememberest,21
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back,21
That the rude sea grew civil at her song,21
To hear the sea-maid's music.,21
That very time I saw but thou couldst not,21
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took,21
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,21
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft,21
And the imperial votaress passed on,21
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:,21
Before milk-white now purple with love's wound,21
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:,21
Will make or man or woman madly dote,21
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again,21
I'll put a girdle round about the earth,21
Exit,21
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,21
The next thing then she waking looks upon,21
On meddling monkey or on busy ape,21
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,21
I'll make her render up her page to me.,21
And I will overhear their conference.,21
I love thee not therefore pursue me not.,21
The one I'll slay the other slayeth me.,21
And here am I and wode within this wood,21
Hence get thee gone and follow me no more.,21
But yet you draw not iron for my heart,21
And I shall have no power to follow you.,21
Or rather do I not in plainest truth,21
And even for that do I love you the more.,21
The more you beat me I will fawn on you:,21
Neglect me lose me; only give me leave,21
What worser place can I beg in your love--,21
Than to be used as you use your dog?,21
For I am sick when I do look on thee.,21
You do impeach your modesty too much,21
Into the hands of one that loves you not;,21
And the ill counsel of a desert place,21
Your virtue is my privilege: for that,21
Therefore I think I am not in the night;,21
For you in my respect are all the world:,21
When all the world is here to look on me?,21
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.,21
Run when you will the story shall be changed:,21
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind,21
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.,21
Or if thou follow me do not believe,21
Ay in the temple in the town the field,21
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:,21
We should be wood and were not made to woo.,21
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,21
Exit,21
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.,21
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.,21
I pray thee give it me.,21
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,21
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:,21
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;,21
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:,21
And make her full of hateful fantasies.,21
A sweet Athenian lady is in love,21
But do it when the next thing he espies,21
By the Athenian garments he hath on.,21
More fond on her than she upon her love:,21
Fear not my lord your servant shall do so.,21
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.,21
Come now a roundel and a fairy song;,21
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,21
To make my small elves coats and some keep back,21
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;,21
The Fairies sing,21
Thorny hedgehogs be not seen;,21
Come not near our fairy queen.,21
Sing in our sweet lullaby;,21
Never harm,21
Come our lovely lady nigh;,21
Weaving spiders come not here;,21
Beetles black approach not near;,21
Philomel with melody  and c.,21
One aloof stand sentinel.,21
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids,21
Do it for thy true-love take,21
Be it ounce or cat or bear,21
In thy eye that shall appear,21
Wake when some vile thing is near.,21
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA,21
And to speak troth I have forgot our way:,21
And tarry for the comfort of the day.,21
For I upon this bank will rest my head.,21
One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth.,21
Lie further off yet do not lie so near.,21
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.,21
So that but one heart we can make of it;,21
So then two bosoms and a single troth.,21
For lying so Hermia I do not lie.,21
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,21
But gentle friend for love and courtesy,21
Such separation as may well be said,21
So far be distant; and good night sweet friend:,21
Amen amen to that fair prayer say I;,21
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!,21
They sleep,21
Through the forest have I gone.,21
On whose eyes I might approve,21
Night and silence.--Who is here?,21
This is he my master said,21
And here the maiden sleeping sound,21
Pretty soul! she durst not lie,21
Churl upon thy eyes I throw,21
When thou wakest let love forbid,21
So awake when I am gone;,21
Exit,21
Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius.,21
O wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.,21
Exit,21
The more my prayer the lesser is my grace.,21
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.,21
If so my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.,21
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:,21
Do as a monster fly my presence thus.,21
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?,21
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood no wound.,21
[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.,21
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.,21
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!,21
What though he love your Hermia? Lord what though?,21
Content with Hermia! No; I do repent,21
Not Hermia but Helena I love:,21
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;,21
Things growing are not ripe until their season,21
And touching now the point of human skill,21
And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook,21
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?,21
Is't not enough is't not enough young man,21
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,21
Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do,21
But fare you well: perforce I must confess,21
O that a lady of one man refused.,21
Exit,21
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!,21
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,21
Are hated most of those they did deceive,21
Of all be hated but the most of me!,21
To honour Helen and to be her knight!,21
[Awaking]  Help me Lysander help me! do thy best,21
Ay me for pity! what a dream was here!,21
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,21
Lysander! what removed? Lysander! lord!,21
Alack where are you speak an if you hear;,21
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh,21
Exit,21
SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.,21
Are we all met?,21
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our,21
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.,21
What sayest thou bully Bottom?,21
Thisby that will never please. First Pyramus must,21
cannot abide. How answer you that?,21
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done.,21
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to,21
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more,21
Pyramus but Bottom the weaver: this will put them,21
Well we will have such a prologue; and it shall be,21
No make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.,21
I fear it I promise you.,21
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies is a,21
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to,21
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.,21
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself,21
defect--'Ladies'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish,21
entreat you--not to fear not to tremble: my life,21
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a,21
his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.,21
that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,21
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?,21
out moonshine find out moonshine.,21
Why then may you leave a casement of the great,21
may shine in at the casement.,21
and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to,21
another thing: we must have a wall in the great,21
talk through the chink of a wall.,21
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him,21
about him to signify wall; and let him hold his,21
and Thisby whisper.,21
every mother's son and rehearse your parts.,21
speech enter into that brake: and so every one,21
Enter PUCK behind,21
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?,21
An actor too perhaps if I see cause.,21
Thisby the flowers of odious savours sweet--,21
--odours savours sweet:,21
But hark a voice! stay thou but here awhile,21
Exit,21
Exit,21
Ay marry must you; for you must understand he goes,21
Most radiant Pyramus most lily-white of hue,21
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,21
I'll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny's tomb.,21
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your,21
is past; it is 'never tire.',21
never tire.,21
If I were fair Thisby I were only thine.,21
masters! fly masters! Help!,21
I'll follow you I'll lead you about a round,21
Sometime a horse I'll be sometime a hound,21
And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn,21
Exit,21
make me afeard.,21
O Bottom thou art changed! what do I see on thee?,21
you?,21
Re-enter QUINCE,21
translated.,21
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;,21
from this place do what they can: I will walk up,21
I am not afraid.,21
The ousel cock so black of hue,21
The throstle with his note so true,21
[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?,21
The finch the sparrow and the lark,21
Whose note full many a man doth mark,21
for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish,21
cuckoo' never so?,21
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;,21
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,21
Methinks mistress you should have little reason,21
love keep little company together now-a-days; the,21
make them friends. Nay I can gleek upon occasion.,21
Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get out,21
Out of this wood do not desire to go:,21
I am a spirit of no common rate;,21
And I do love thee: therefore go with me;,21
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,21
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so,21
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!,21
Ready.,21
And I.,21
Where shall we go?,21
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;,21
With purple grapes green figs and mulberries;,21
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,21
To have my love to bed and to arise;,21
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:,21
Hail mortal!,21
Hail!,21
I cry your worship's mercy heartily: I beseech your,21
Cobweb.,21
Cobweb: if I cut my finger I shall make bold with,21
Peaseblossom.,21
mother and to Master Peascod your father. Good,21
acquaintance too. Your name I beseech you sir?,21
Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well:,21
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise,21
desire your more acquaintance good Master,21
Come wait upon him; lead him to my bower.,21
And when she weeps weeps every little flower,21
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.,21
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.,21
I wonder if Titania be awaked;,21
Which she must dote on in extremity.,21
Here comes my messenger.,21
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?,21
Near to her close and consecrated bower,21
A crew of patches rude mechanicals,21
Were met together to rehearse a play,21
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,21
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake,21
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:,21
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,21
Or russet-pated choughs many in sort,21
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,21
And at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls;,21
Their sense thus weak lost with their fears,21
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;,21
Some sleeves some hats from yielders all,21
I led them on in this distracted fear,21
When in that moment so it came to pass,21
This falls out better than I could devise.,21
With the love-juice as I did bid thee do?,21
And the Athenian woman by his side:,21
Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS,21
This is the woman but not this the man.,21
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.,21
For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse,21
Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep,21
The sun was not so true unto the day,21
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon,21
May through the centre creep and so displease,21
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;,21
So should the murder'd look and so should I,21
Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear,21
What's this to my Lysander? where is he?,21
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.,21
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him then?,21
O once tell true tell true even for my sake!,21
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!,21
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue,21
You spend your passion on a misprised mood:,21
Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell.,21
An if I could what should I get therefore?,21
And from thy hated presence part I so:,21
Exit,21
Here therefore for a while I will remain.,21
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:,21
If for his tender here I make some stay.,21
What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,21
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue,21
Then fate o'er-rules that one man holding troth,21
About the wood go swifter than the wind,21
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,21
By some illusion see thou bring her here:,21
I go I go; look how I go,21
Exit,21
Hit with Cupid's archery,21
When his love he doth espy,21
As the Venus of the sky.,21
Beg of her for remedy.,21
Captain of our fairy band,21
And the youth mistook by me,21
Shall we their fond pageant see?,21
Stand aside: the noise they make,21
Then will two at once woo one;,21
And those things do best please me,21
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA,21
Scorn and derision never come in tears:,21
In their nativity all truth appears.,21
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?,21
When truth kills truth O devilish-holy fray!,21
Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh:,21
Will even weigh and both as light as tales.,21
Nor none in my mind now you give her o'er.,21
[Awaking]  O Helena goddess nymph perfect divine!,21
Crystal is muddy. O how ripe in show,21
That pure congealed white high Taurus snow,21
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O let me kiss,21
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent,21
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,21
Can you not hate me as I know you do,21
If you were men as men you are in show,21
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,21
You both are rivals and love Hermia;,21
A trim exploit a manly enterprise,21
With your derision! none of noble sort,21
A poor soul's patience all to make you sport.,21
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:,21
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;,21
Whom I do love and will do till my death.,21
Lysander keep thy Hermia; I will none:,21
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,21
There to remain.,21
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,21
Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.,21
Dark night that from the eye his function takes,21
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,21
Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found;,21
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?,21
What love could press Lysander from my side?,21
Fair Helena who more engilds the night,21
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,21
You speak not as you think: it cannot be.,21
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three,21
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!,21
To bait me with this foul derision?,21
The sisters' vows the hours that we have spent,21
For parting us--O is it all forgot?,21
We Hermia like two artificial gods,21
Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion,21
As if our hands our sides voices and minds,21
Like to a double cherry seeming parted,21
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;,21
Two of the first like coats in heraldry,21
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,21
It is not friendly 'tis not maidenly:,21
Though I alone do feel the injury.,21
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.,21
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?,21
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,21
Precious celestial? Wherefore speaks he this,21
Deny your love so rich within his soul,21
But by your setting on by your consent?,21
So hung upon with love so fortunate,21
This you should pity rather than despise.,21
Ay do persever counterfeit sad looks,21
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:,21
If you have any pity grace or manners,21
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;,21
Stay gentle Helena; hear my excuse:,21
O excellent!,21
If she cannot entreat I can compel.,21
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.,21
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,21
I say I love thee more than he can do.,21
Quick come!,21
Away you Ethiope!,21
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,21
Hang off thou cat thou burr! vile thing let loose,21
Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?,21
Thy love! out tawny Tartar out!,21
Do you not jest?,21
Demetrius I will keep my word with thee.,21
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.,21
Although I hate her I'll not harm her so.,21
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news my love!,21
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.,21
me:,21
In earnest shall I say?,21
And never did desire to see thee more.,21
Be certain nothing truer; 'tis no jest,21
O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!,21
And stolen my love's heart from him?,21
Have you no modesty no maiden shame,21
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?,21
Puppet? why so? ay that way goes the game.,21
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;,21
Her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him.,21
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?,21
How low am I? I am not yet so low,21
I pray you though you mock me gentlemen,21
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;,21
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,21
That I can match her.,21
Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me.,21
Did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you;,21
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.,21
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me,21
And now so you will let me quiet go,21
And follow you no further: let me go:,21
Why get you gone: who is't that hinders you?,21
What with Lysander?,21
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee Helena.,21
O when she's angry she is keen and shrewd!,21
And though she be but little she is fierce.,21
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?,21
Get you gone you dwarf;,21
You bead you acorn.,21
In her behalf that scorns your services.,21
Take not her part; for if thou dost intend,21
Thou shalt aby it.,21
Now follow if thou darest to try whose right,21
Follow! nay I'll go with thee cheek by jole.,21
You mistress all this coil is 'long of you:,21
I will not trust you I,21
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,21
Exit,21
Exit,21
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.,21
Did not you tell me I should know the man,21
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,21
And so far am I glad it so did sort,21
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:,21
The starry welkin cover thou anon,21
And lead these testy rivals so astray,21
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,21
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;,21
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep,21
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;,21
To take from thence all error with his might,21
When they next wake all this derision,21
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,21
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,21
And then I will her charmed eye release,21
My fairy lord this must be done with haste,21
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;,21
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,21
Already to their wormy beds are gone;,21
They willfully themselves exile from light,21
But we are spirits of another sort:,21
And like a forester the groves may tread,21
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,21
But notwithstanding haste; make no delay:,21
Exit,21
I will lead them up and down:,21
Goblin lead them up and down.,21
Re-enter LYSANDER,21
Here villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?,21
Follow me then,21
Exit LYSANDER as following the voice,21
Lysander! speak again:,21
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?,21
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,21
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled,21
Yea art thou there?,21
Exeunt,21
He goes before me and still dares me on:,21
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:,21
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,21
Lies down,21
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,21
Sleeps,21
Ho ho ho! Coward why comest thou not?,21
Thou runn'st before me shifting every place,21
Where art thou now?,21
Nay then thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,21
Now go thy way. Faintness constraineth me,21
By day's approach look to be visited.,21
Re-enter HELENA,21
Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,21
From these that my poor company detest:,21
Steal me awhile from mine own company.,21
Yet but three? Come one more;,21
Here she comes curst and sad:,21
Thus to make poor females mad.,21
Never so weary never so in woe,21
I can no further crawl no further go;,21
Here will I rest me till the break of day.,21
Lies down and sleeps,21
Sleep sound:,21
To your eye,21
Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes,21
Thou takest,21
In the sight,21
And the country proverb known,21
In your waking shall be shown:,21
Nought shall go ill;,21
Exit,21
SCENE I. The same. LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HELENA and HERMIA,21
Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM COBWEB MOTH  MUSTARDSEED and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen,21
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,21
And kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy.,21
Ready.,21
Ready.,21
weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped,21
mounsieur bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret,21
good mounsieur have a care the honey-bag break not;,21
honey-bag signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?,21
Give me your neaf Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,21
What's your Will?,21
to scratch. I must to the barber's monsieur; for,21
am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me,21
What wilt thou hear some music,21
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have,21
Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat.,21
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle,21
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek,21
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.,21
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.,21
Fairies begone and be all ways away.,21
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle,21
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.,21
They sleep,21
[Advancing]  Welcome good Robin.,21
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:,21
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,21
For she his hairy temples then had rounded,21
And that same dew which sometime on the buds,21
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes,21
When I had at my pleasure taunted her,21
I then did ask of her her changeling child;,21
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.,21
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:,21
From off the head of this Athenian swain;,21
May all to Athens back again repair,21
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.,21
Be as thou wast wont to be;,21
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower,21
Now my Titania; wake you my sweet queen.,21
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.,21
How came these things to pass?,21
Silence awhile. Robin take off this head.,21
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.,21
Music still,21
own fool's eyes peep.,21
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.,21
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly,21
And bless it to all fair prosperity:,21
Wedded with Theseus all in jollity.,21
I do hear the morning lark.,21
Trip we after the night's shade:,21
Swifter than the wandering moon.,21
Tell me how it came this night,21
With these mortals on the ground.,21
Horns winded within,21
Go one of you find out the forester;,21
And since we have the vaward of the day,21
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:,21
Exit an Attendant,21
And mark the musical confusion,21
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,21
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear,21
The skies the fountains every region near,21
So musical a discord such sweet thunder.,21
So flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung,21
Crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;,21
Each under each. A cry more tuneable,21
In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly:,21
My lord this is my daughter here asleep;,21
This Helena old Nedar's Helena:,21
No doubt they rose up early to observe,21
Came here in grace our solemnity.,21
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?,21
Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.,21
Good morrow friends. Saint Valentine is past:,21
Pardon my lord.,21
I know you two are rival enemies:,21
That hatred is so far from jealousy,21
My lord I shall reply amazedly,21
I cannot truly say how I came here;,21
And now do I bethink me so it is--,21
Was to be gone from Athens where we might,21
Enough enough my lord; you have enough:,21
They would have stolen away; they would Demetrius,21
You of your wife and me of my consent,21
My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth,21
And I in fury hither follow'd them,21
But my good lord I wot not by what power--,21
Melted as the snow seems to me now,21
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;,21
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,21
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:,21
But as in health come to my natural taste,21
And will for evermore be true to it.,21
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.,21
For in the temple by and by with us,21
And for the morning now is something worn,21
Away with us to Athens; three and three,21
Come Hippolyta.,21
These things seem small and undistinguishable,21
When every thing seems double.,21
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,21
Are you sure,21
That yet we sleep we dream. Do not you think,21
Yea; and my father.,21
And he did bid us follow to the temple.,21
And by the way let us recount our dreams.,21
[Awaking]  When my cue comes call me and I will,21
Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender! Snout,21
hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare,21
say what dream it was: man is but an ass if he go,21
is no man can tell what. Methought I was--and,21
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye,21
seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue,21
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of,21
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the,21
peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall,21
Exit,21
Enter QUINCE FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING,21
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is,21
If he come not then the play is marred: it goes,21
It is not possible: you have not a man in all,21
No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft,21
Yea and the best person too; and he is a very,21
You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is God bless us,21
Enter SNUG,21
there is two or three lords and ladies more married:,21
men.,21
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped,21
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I'll be hanged;,21
Pyramus or nothing.,21
Where are these lads? where are these hearts?,21
Masters I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not,21
will tell you every thing right as it fell out.,21
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that,21
good strings to your beards new ribbons to your,21
o'er his part; for the short and the long is our,21
clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion,21
lion's claws. And most dear actors eat no onions,21
do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet,21
Exeunt,21
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.,21
Tis strange my Theseus that these,21
More strange than true: I never may believe,21
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,21
More than cool reason ever comprehends.,21
Are of imagination all compact:,21
That is the madman: the lover all as frantic,21
The poet's eye in fine frenzy rolling,21
And as imagination bodies forth,21
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing,21
Such tricks hath strong imagination,21
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;,21
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!,21
And all their minds transfigured so together,21
And grows to something of great constancy;,21
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth.,21
Joy gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love,21
More than to us,21
Come now; what masques what dances shall we have,21
Between our after-supper and bed-time?,21
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,21
Call Philostrate.,21
Say what abridgement have you for this evening?,21
The lazy time if not with some delight?,21
Make choice of which your highness will see first.,21
[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs to be sung,21
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,21
Reads,21
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.',21
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.,21
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death,21
That is some satire keen and critical,21
Reads,21
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.',21
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.,21
A play there is my lord some ten words long,21
But by ten words my lord it is too long,21
There is not one word apt one player fitted:,21
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.,21
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears,21
What are they that do play it?,21
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,21
With this same play against your nuptial.,21
No my noble lord;,21
And it is nothing nothing in the world;,21
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,21
I will hear that play;,21
When simpleness and duty tender it.,21
Exit PHILOSTRATE,21
And duty in his service perishing.,21
He says they can do nothing in this kind.,21
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:,21
Takes it in might not merit.,21
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;,21
Make periods in the midst of sentences,21
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,21
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;,21
I read as much as from the rattling tongue,21
Love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity,21
Re-enter PHILOSTRATE,21
Let him approach.,21
Enter QUINCE for the Prologue,21
That you should think we come not to offend,21
That is the true beginning of our end.,21
We do not come as minding to contest you,21
We are not here. That you should here repent you,21
You shall know all that you are like to know.,21
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows,21
enough to speak but to speak true.,21
on a recorder; a sound but not in government.,21
impaired but all disordered. Who is next?,21
Gentles perchance you wonder at this show;,21
This man is Pyramus if you would know;,21
This man with lime and rough-cast doth present,21
And through Wall's chink poor souls they are content,21
This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn,21
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn,21
This grisly beast which Lion hight by name,21
Did scare away or rather did affright;,21
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.,21
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:,21
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;,21
His dagger drew and died. For all the rest,21
At large discourse while here they do remain.,21
I wonder if the lion be to speak.,21
In this same interlude it doth befall,21
And such a wall as I would have you think,21
Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby,21
This loam this rough-cast and this stone doth show,21
And this the cranny is right and sinister,21
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?,21
discourse my lord.,21
Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!,21
O night which ever art when day is not!,21
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!,21
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!,21
Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne!,21
Thanks courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!,21
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss!,21
The wall methinks being sensible should curse again.,21
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now and I am to,21
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.,21
O wall full often hast thou heard my moans,21
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,21
I see a voice: now will I to the chink,21
My love thou art my love I think.,21
And like Limander am I trusty still.,21
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.,21
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!,21
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?,21
Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe,21
And being done thus Wall away doth go.,21
Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.,21
without warning.,21
The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst,21
It must be your imagination then and not theirs.,21
themselves they may pass for excellent men. Here,21
Enter Lion and Moonshine,21
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,21
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.,21
A lion-fell nor else no lion's dam;,21
Into this place 'twere pity on my life.,21
The very best at a beast my lord that e'er I saw.,21
True; and a goose for his discretion.,21
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.,21
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:,21
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--,21
He is no crescent and his horns are,21
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;,21
This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man,21
man i' the moon?,21
see it is already in snuff.,21
It appears by his small light of discretion that,21
reason we must stay the time.,21
All that I have to say is to tell you that the,21
thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my dog.,21
these are in the moon. But silence! here comes Thisbe.,21
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?,21
Thisbe runs off,21
Well run Thisbe.,21
good grace.,21
Well moused Lion.,21
And then came Pyramus.,21
Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams;,21
For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams,21
But stay O spite!,21
What dreadful dole is here!,21
How can it be?,21
Thy mantle good,21
Approach ye Furies fell!,21
Cut thread and thrum;,21
This passion and the death of a dear friend would,21
Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.,21
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:,21
That lived that loved that liked that look'd,21
Come tears confound;,21
The pap of Pyramus;,21
Where heart doth hop:,21
Thus die I thus thus thus.,21
Now am I fled;,21
Tongue lose thy light;,21
Exit Moonshine,21
Dies,21
Less than an ace man; for he is dead; he is nothing.,21
prove an ass.,21
back and finds her lover?,21
her passion ends the play.,21
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a,21
A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which,21
she for a woman God bless us.,21
And thus she means videlicet:--,21
What dead my dove?,21
Speak speak. Quite dumb?,21
Must cover thy sweet eyes.,21
This cherry nose,21
Are gone are gone:,21
His eyes were green as leeks.,21
Come come to me,21
Lay them in gore,21
With shears his thread of silk.,21
Come trusty sword;,21
Stabs herself,21
Thus Thisby ends:,21
Dies,21
Ay and Wall too.,21
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the,21
of our company?,21
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all,21
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself,21
tragedy: and so it is truly; and very notably,21
epilogue alone.,21
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:,21
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,21
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled,21
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,21
Exeunt,21
Now the hungry lion roars,21
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,21
Now the wasted brands do glow,21
Puts the wretch that lies in woe,21
Now it is the time of night,21
Every one lets forth his sprite,21
And we fairies that do run,21
From the presence of the sun,21
Now are frolic: not a mouse,21
I am sent with broom before,21
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train,21
By the dead and drowsy fire:,21
Hop as light as bird from brier;,21
Sing and dance it trippingly.,21
To each word a warbling note:,21
Will we sing and bless this place.,21
Now until the break of day,21
To the best bride-bed will we,21
And the issue there create,21
So shall all the couples three,21
And the blots of Nature's hand,21
Never mole hare lip nor scar,21
Despised in nativity,21
With this field-dew consecrate,21
And each several chamber bless,21
And the owner of it blest,21
Trip away; make no stay;,21
Exeunt OBERON TITANIA and train,21
Think but this and all is mended,21
While these visions did appear.,21
No more yielding but a dream,21
if you pardon we will mend:,21
If we have unearned luck,21
We will make amends ere long;,21
So good night unto you all.,21
And Robin shall restore amends.,21
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.,22
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon,22
He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off,22
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?,22
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings,22
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.,22
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the,22
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better,22
tell you how.,22
glad of it.,22
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could,22
bitterness.,22
In great measure.,22
truer than those that are so washed. How much,22
I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the,22
I know none of that name lady: there was none such,22
What is he that you ask for niece?,22
O he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.,22
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool reading,22
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you how many hath he,22
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.,22
but he'll be meet with you I doubt it not.,22
You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it:,22
excellent stomach.,22
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?,22
honourable virtues.,22
but for the stuffing--well we are all mortal.,22
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:,22
between them.,22
conflict four of his five wits went halting off and,22
he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him,22
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,22
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.,22
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as,22
next block.,22
No; an he were I would burn my study. But I pray,22
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?,22
O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease: he,22
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if,22
thousand pound ere a' be cured.,22
Do good friend.,22
No not till a hot January.,22
Enter DON PEDRO DON JOHN CLAUDIO BENEDICK and BALTHASAR,22
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid,22
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of,22
remain; but when you depart from me sorrow abides,22
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this,22
Her mother hath many times told me so.,22
Signior Benedick no; for then were you a child.,22
what you are being a man. Truly the lady fathers,22
honourable father.,22
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as,22
I wonder that you will still be talking Signior,22
What my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?,22
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?,22
in her presence.,22
am loved of all ladies only you excepted: and I,22
heart; for truly I love none.,22
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God,22
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man,22
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some,22
scratched face.,22
a face as yours were.,22
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.,22
so good a continuer. But keep your way i' God's,22
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.,22
and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath,22
the least a month; and he heartily prays some,22
hypocrite but prays from his heart.,22
To DON JOHN,22
the prince your brother I owe you all duty.,22
you.,22
Your hand Leonato; we will go together.,22
Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?,22
Is she not a modest young lady?,22
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak,22
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.,22
praise too brown for a fair praise and too little,22
afford her that were she other than she is she,22
do not like her.,22
truly how thou likest her.,22
Can the world buy such a jewel?,22
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,22
rare carpenter? Come in what key shall a man take,22
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I,22
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such,22
possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty,22
hope you have no intent to turn husband have you?,22
contrary if Hero would be my wife.,22
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?,22
Go to i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck,22
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.,22
What secret hath held you here that you followed,22
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.,22
You hear Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb,22
allegiance mark you this on my allegiance. He is,22
Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero Leonato's,22
If this were so so were it uttered.,22
twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be,22
If my passion change not shortly God forbid it,22
Amen if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.,22
By my troth I speak my thought.,22
And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine.,22
That she is worthy I know.,22
know how she should be worthy is the opinion that,22
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite,22
And never could maintain his part but in the force,22
That a woman conceived me I thank her; that she,22
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my,22
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do,22
right to trust none; and the fine is for the which,22
I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love.,22
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood,22
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me,22
blind Cupid.,22
wilt prove a notable argument.,22
at me; and he that hits me let him be clapped on,22
Well as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull,22
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible,22
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,22
good horse to hire' let them signify under my sign,22
If this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn-mad.,22
Venice thou wilt quake for this shortly.,22
Well you temporize with the hours. In the,22
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will,22
great preparation.,22
embassage; and so I commit you--,22
The sixth of July: Your loving friend Benedick.,22
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and,22
you flout old ends any further examine your,22
Exit,22
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,22
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.,22
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.,22
O my lord,22
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,22
Than to drive liking to the name of love:,22
Have left their places vacant in their rooms,22
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,22
Thou wilt be like a lover presently,22
If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it,22
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end,22
How sweetly you do minister to love,22
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,22
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?,22
Look what will serve is fit: 'tis once thou lovest,22
I know we shall have revelling to-night:,22
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,22
And take her hearing prisoner with the force,22
Then after to her father will I break;,22
In practise let us put it presently.,22
SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.,22
How now brother! Where is my cousin your son?,22
He is very busy about it. But brother I can tell,22
Are they good?,22
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count,22
orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine:,22
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it,22
accordant he meant to take the present time by the,22
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?,22
question him yourself.,22
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,22
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.,22
Cousins you know what you have to do. O I cry you,22
skill. Good cousin have a care this busy time.,22
SCENE III. The same.,22
What the good-year my lord! why are you thus out,22
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;,22
You should hear reason.,22
If not a present remedy at least a patient,22
I wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art,22
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide,22
at no man's jests eat when I have stomach and wait,22
tend on no man's business laugh when I am merry and,22
Yea but you must not make the full show of this,22
late stood out against your brother and he hath,22
impossible you should take true root but by the,22
that you frame the season for your own harvest.,22
his grace and it better fits my blood to be,22
love from any: in this though I cannot be said to,22
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with,22
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my,22
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and,22
Can you make no use of your discontent?,22
Who comes here?,22
What news Borachio?,22
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I,22
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?,22
unquietness?,22
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?,22
A proper squire! And who and who? which way looks,22
Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato.,22
Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a,22
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the,22
prince should woo Hero for himself and having,22
Come come let us thither: this may prove food to,22
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way I,22
To the death my lord.,22
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of,22
We'll wait upon your lordship.,22
ACT II,22
Enter LEONATO ANTONIO HERO BEATRICE and others,22
I saw him not.,22
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.,22
He were an excellent man that were made just in the,22
like an image and says nothing and the other too,22
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's,22
Benedick's face--,22
enough in his purse such a man would win any woman,22
By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a,22
In faith she's too curst.,22
sending that way; for it is said 'God sends a curst,22
So by being too curst God will send you no horns.,22
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and,22
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.,22
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel,22
beard is more than a youth and he that hath no,22
a youth is not for me and he that is less than a,22
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward and lead his,22
Well then go you into hell?,22
me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and,22
heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver,22
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit and,22
[To HERO]  Well niece I trust you will be ruled,22
Yes faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy,22
that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else,22
me.',22
Not till God make men of some other metal than,22
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make,22
No uncle I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;,22
Daughter remember what I told you: if the prince,22
The fault will be in the music cousin if you be,22
important tell him there is measure in every thing,22
wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig,22
and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as,22
measure full of state and ancientry; and then comes,22
cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave.,22
I have a good eye uncle; I can see a church by daylight.,22
All put on their masks,22
Lady will you walk about with your friend?,22
I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.,22
I may say so when I please.,22
When I like your favour; for God defend the lute,22
My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.,22
Speak low if you speak love.,22
Well I would you did like me.,22
ill-qualities.,22
I say my prayers aloud.,22
God match me with a good dancer!,22
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is,22
No more words: the clerk is answered.,22
At a word I am not.,22
To tell you true I counterfeit him.,22
the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you,22
At a word I am not.,22
excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,22
end.,22
No you shall pardon me.,22
Not now.,22
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was,22
What's he?,22
Not I believe me.,22
I pray you what is he?,22
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:,22
commendation is not in his wit but in his villany;,22
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in,22
When I know the gentleman I'll tell him what you say.,22
which peradventure not marked or not laughed at,22
partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no,22
Music,22
In every good thing.,22
the next turning.,22
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath,22
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.,22
Are not you Signior Benedick?,22
Signior you are very near my brother in his love:,22
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may,22
How know you he loves her?,22
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.,22
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO,22
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.,22
Friendship is constant in all other things,22
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;,22
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch,22
This is an accident of hourly proof,22
Re-enter BENEDICK,22
Yea the same.,22
Whither?,22
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?,22
your arm like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear,22
I wish him joy of her.,22
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would,22
I pray you leave me.,22
boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post.,22
Exit,22
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not,22
under that title because I am merry. Yea but so I,22
is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice,22
out. Well I'll be revenged as I may.,22
Now signior where's the count? did you see him?,22
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a,22
that your grace had got the good will of this young,22
either to make him a garland as being forsaken or,22
To be whipped! What's his fault?,22
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest shows it his,22
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The,22
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,22
worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on,22
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to,22
If their singing answer your saying by my faith,22
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the,22
wronged by you.,22
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have,22
scold with her. She told me not thinking I had been,22
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest,22
like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at,22
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,22
the north star. I would not marry her though she,22
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have,22
the fire too. Come talk not of her: you shall find,22
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly while,22
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they,22
and perturbation follows her.,22
Enter CLAUDIO BEATRICE HERO and LEONATO,22
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now,22
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the,22
Prester John's foot fetch you a hair off the great,22
rather than hold three words' conference with this,22
None but to desire your good company.,22
endure my Lady Tongue.,22
Come lady come; you have lost the heart of,22
Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile; and I gave,22
marry once before he won it of me with false dice,22
You have put him down lady you have put him down.,22
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought,22
Why how now count! wherefore are you sad?,22
How then? sick?,22
The count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor,22
something of that jealous complexion.,22
though I'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is,22
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,22
marriage and God give thee joy!,22
fortunes: his grace hath made the match and an,22
Speak count 'tis your cue.,22
but little happy if I could say how much. Lady as,22
you and dote upon the exchange.,22
with a kiss and let not him speak neither.,22
Yea my lord; I thank it poor fool it keeps on,22
ear that he is in her heart.,22
Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes every one to the,22
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!,22
I would rather have one of your father's getting.,22
father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them.,22
No my lord unless I might have another for,22
every day. But I beseech your grace pardon me: I,22
Your silence most offends me and to be merry best,22
a merry hour.,22
was a star danced and under that was I born.,22
Niece will you look to those things I told you of?,22
Exit,22
There's little of the melancholy element in her my,22
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,22
herself with laughing.,22
O by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.,22
O Lord my lord if they were but a week married,22
County Claudio when mean you to go to church?,22
have all his rites.,22
seven-night; and a time too brief too to have all,22
Come you shake the head at so long a breathing:,22
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of,22
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of,22
it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if,22
shall give you direction.,22
nights' watchings.,22
And you too gentle Hero?,22
cousin to a good husband.,22
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble,22
will teach you how to humour your cousin that she,22
two helps will so practise on Benedick that in,22
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,22
ours for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,22
Exeunt,22
Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO,22
daughter of Leonato.,22
Any bar any cross any impediment will be,22
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges,22
Not honestly my lord; but so covertly that no,22
Show me briefly how.,22
I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting,22
I remember.,22
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.,22
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to,22
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned,22
up--to a contaminated stale such a one as Hero.,22
Proof enough to misuse the prince to vex Claudio,22
other issue?,22
Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and,22
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the,22
honour who hath made this match and his friend's,22
semblance of a maid--that you have discovered,22
offer them instances; which shall bear no less,22
hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me,22
before the intended wedding--for in the meantime I,22
absent--and there shall appear such seeming truth,22
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.,22
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this and,22
Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning,22
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.,22
SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.,22
Boy!,22
Signior?,22
to me in the orchard.,22
I know that; but I would have thee hence and here again.,22
I do much wonder that one man seeing how much,22
behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at,22
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man,22
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he,22
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a,22
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to,22
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his,22
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with,22
be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but,22
of me he shall never make me such a fool. One woman,22
well; another virtuous yet I am well; but till all,22
my grace. Rich she shall be that's certain; wise,22
fair or I'll   never look on her; mild or come not,22
discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall,22
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.,22
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and LEONATO,22
Yea my good lord. How still the evening is,22
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?,22
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.,22
Come Balthasar we'll hear that song again.,22
To slander music any more than once.,22
To put a strange face on his own perfection.,22
Because you talk of wooing I will sing;,22
To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes,22
Now pray thee come;,22
Do it in notes.,22
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.,22
Note notes forsooth and nothing.,22
Now divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it,22
of men's bodies? Well a horn for my money when,22
The Song,22
Men were deceivers ever,22
To one thing constant never:,22
And be you blithe and bonny,22
Into Hey nonny nonny.,22
Of dumps so dull and heavy;,22
Since summer first was leafy:,22
By my troth a good song.,22
Ha no no faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.,22
they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad,22
night-raven come what plague could have come after,22
Yea marry dost thou hear Balthasar? I pray thee,22
would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.,22
Do so: farewell.,22
Come hither Leonato. What was it you told me of,22
Signior Benedick?,22
never think that lady would have loved any man.,22
should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in,22
Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?,22
of it but that she loves him with an enraged,22
May be she doth but counterfeit.,22
O God counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of,22
discovers it.,22
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.,22
my daughter tell you how.,22
How how pray you? You amaze me: I would have I,22
assaults of affection.,22
against Benedick.,22
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,22
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.,22
No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.,22
I' says she 'that have so oft encountered him,22
This says she now when she is beginning to write to,22
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a,22
Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a,22
O when she had writ it and was reading it over she,22
That.,22
railed at herself that she should be so immodest,22
measure him' says she 'by my own spirit; for I,22
love him I should.',22
beats her heart tears her hair prays curses; 'O,22
She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the,22
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage,22
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some,22
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and,22
An he should it were an alms to hang him. She's an,22
she is virtuous.,22
In every thing but in loving Benedick.,22
a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath,22
cause being her uncle and her guardian.,22
have daffed all other respects and made her half,22
what a' will say.,22
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she,22
she make her love known and she will die if he woo,22
accustomed crossness.,22
love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the,22
He is a very proper man.,22
Before God! and in my mind very wise.,22
And I take him to be valiant.,22
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he,22
them with a most Christian-like fear.,22
if he break the peace he ought to enter into a,22
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,22
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall,22
Never tell him my lord: let her wear it out with,22
Nay that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.,22
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I,22
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.,22
If he do not dote on her upon this I will never,22
Let there be the same net spread for her; and that,22
sport will be when they hold one an opinion of,22
scene that I would see which will be merely a,22
Exeunt DON PEDRO CLAUDIO and LEONATO,22
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of,22
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!,22
they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive,22
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did,22
are they that hear their detractions and can put,22
truth I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis,22
me; by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor,22
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some,22
because I have railed so long against marriage: but,22
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.,22
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?,22
die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I,22
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in,22
Enter BEATRICE,22
Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains.,22
pains to thank me: if it had been painful I would,22
You take pleasure then in the message?,22
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,22
Exit,22
to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took,22
to thank me.' that's as much as to say Any pains,22
not take pity of her I am a villain; if I do not,22
Exit,22
SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.,22
Good Margaret run thee to the parlor;,22
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:,22
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse,22
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,22
Forbid the sun to enter like favourites,22
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,22
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.,22
Exit,22
As we do trace this alley up and down,22
When I do name him let it be thy part,22
My talk to thee must be how Benedick,22
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,22
Enter BEATRICE behind,22
For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs,22
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish,22
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:,22
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.,22
Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing,22
Approaching the bower,22
I know her spirits are as coy and wild,22
But are you sure,22
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.,22
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;,22
To wish him wrestle with affection,22
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman,22
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?,22
As much as may be yielded to a man:,22
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;,22
Misprising what they look on and her wit,22
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,22
She is so self-endeared.,22
And therefore certainly it were not good,22
Why you speak truth. I never yet saw man,22
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,22
If black why Nature drawing of an antique,22
If low an agate very vilely cut;,22
If silent why a block moved with none.,22
And never gives to truth and virtue that,22
Sure sure such carping is not commendable.,22
As Beatrice is cannot be commendable:,22
She would mock me into air; O she would laugh me,22
Therefore let Benedick like cover'd fire,22
It were a better death than die with mocks,22
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.,22
And counsel him to fight against his passion.,22
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know,22
O do not do your cousin such a wrong.,22
Having so swift and excellent a wit,22
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.,22
Always excepted my dear Claudio.,22
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,22
Goes foremost in report through Italy.,22
His excellence did earn it ere he had it.,22
Why every day to-morrow. Come go in:,22
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.,22
If it proves so then loving goes by haps:,22
Exeunt HERO and URSULA,22
What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?,22
Contempt farewell! and maiden pride adieu!,22
And Benedick love on; I will requite thee,22
If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee,22
For others say thou dost deserve and I,22
Exit,22
Enter DON PEDRO CLAUDIO BENEDICK and LEONATO,22
then go I toward Arragon.,22
vouchsafe me.,22
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat,22
with Benedick for his company; for from the crown,22
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's,22
him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his,22
tongue speaks.,22
So say I methinks you are sadder.,22
Hang him truant! there's no true drop of blood in,22
he wants money.,22
Draw it.,22
You must hang it first and draw it afterwards.,22
Where is but a humour or a worm.,22
it.,22
There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be,22
a Dutchman today a Frenchman to-morrow or in the,22
the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from,22
to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no,22
If he be not in love with some woman there is no,22
mornings; what should that bode?,22
No but the barber's man hath been seen with him,22
stuffed tennis-balls.,22
Nay a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him,22
That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love.,22
And when was he wont to wash his face?,22
what they say of him.,22
a lute-string and now governed by stops.,22
conclude he is in love.,22
That would I know too: I warrant one that knows him not.,22
all dies for him.,22
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old,22
or nine wise words to speak to you which these,22
Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO,22
Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this,22
bears will not bite one another when they meet.,22
My lord and brother God save you!,22
If your leisure served I would speak with you.,22
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for,22
What's the matter?,22
to-morrow?,22
I know not that when he knows what I know.,22
You may think I love you not: let that appear,22
manifest. For my brother I think he holds you,22
your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and,22
Why what's the matter?,22
shortened for she has been too long a talking of,22
Who Hero?,22
Disloyal?,22
could say she were worse: think you of a worse,22
further warrant: go but with me to-night you shall,22
before her wedding-day: if you love her then,22
to change your mind.,22
I will not think it.,22
that you know: if you will follow me I will show,22
more proceed accordingly.,22
her to-morrow in the congregation where I should,22
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join,22
I will disparage her no farther till you are my,22
let the issue show itself.,22
O mischief strangely thwarting!,22
you have seen the sequel.,22
SCENE III. A street.,22
Are you good men and true?,22
salvation body and soul.,22
they should have any allegiance in them being,22
Well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry.,22
constable?,22
write and read.,22
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is,22
Both which master constable--,22
for your favour sir why give God thanks and make,22
let that appear when there is no need of such,22
senseless and fit man for the constable of the,22
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are,22
How if a' will not stand?,22
presently call the rest of the watch together and,22
If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none,22
True and they are to meddle with none but the,22
the streets; for for the watch to babble and to,22
We will rather sleep than talk: we know what,22
Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet,22
offend: only have a care that your bills be not,22
ale-houses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.,22
Why then let them alone till they are sober: if,22
say they are not the men you took them for.,22
If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue,22
kind of men the less you meddle or make with them,22
If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay,22
Truly by your office you may; but I think they,22
way for you if you do take a thief is to let him,22
You have been always called a merciful man partner.,22
a man who hath any honesty in him.,22
to the nurse and bid her still it.,22
Why then depart in peace and let the child wake,22
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.,22
This is the end of the charge:--you constable are,22
prince in the night you may stay him.,22
Five shillings to one on't with any man that knows,22
the prince be willing; for indeed the watch ought,22
man against his will.,22
Ha ha ha! Well masters good night: an there be,22
fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.,22
Well masters we hear our charge: let us go sit here,22
One word more honest neighbours. I pray you watch,22
there to-morrow there is a great coil to-night.,22
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES,22
What Conrade!,22
Conrade I say!,22
Mass and my elbow itched; I thought there would a,22
I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward,22
Stand thee close then under this pent-house for,22
utter all to thee.,22
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.,22
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any,22
have need of poor ones poor ones may make what,22
I wonder at it.,22
the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is,22
Yes it is apparel.,22
Yes the fashion is the fashion.,22
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion,22
[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile,22
gentleman: I remember his name.,22
No; 'twas the vane on the house.,22
fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot,22
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers,22
priests in the old church-window sometime like the,22
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?,22
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou,22
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?,22
wooed Margaret the Lady Hero's gentlewoman by the,22
chamber-window bids me a thousand times good,22
tell thee how the prince Claudio and my master,22
John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.,22
Two of them did the prince and Claudio; but the,22
by his oaths which first possessed them partly by,22
by my villany which did confirm any slander that,22
he would meet her as he was appointed next morning,22
congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night,22
We charge you in the prince's name stand!,22
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that,22
And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a',22
Masters masters--,22
Masters--,22
We are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken,22
A commodity in question I warrant you. Come we'll obey you.,22
SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.,22
Good Ursula wake my cousin Beatrice and desire,22
I will lady.,22
Well.,22
Troth I think your other rabato were better.,22
By my troth 's not so good; and I warrant your,22
My cousin's a fool and thou art another: I'll wear,22
I like the new tire within excellently if the hair,22
fashion i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's,22
O that exceeds they say.,22
yours: cloth o' gold and cuts and laced with,22
and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel:,22
fashion yours is worth ten on 't.,22
exceeding heavy.,22
Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?,22
marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord,22
me say 'saving your reverence a husband:' and bad,22
nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a,22
and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light and not,22
Enter BEATRICE,22
Good morrow sweet Hero.,22
I am out of all other tune methinks.,22
burden: do you sing it and I'll dance it.,22
husband have stables enough you'll see he shall,22
O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.,22
ready. By my troth I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!,22
For the letter that begins them all H.,22
sailing by the star.,22
Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!,22
excellent perfume.,22
A maid and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.,22
professed apprehension?,22
It is not seen enough you should wear it in your,22
Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,22
There thou prickest her with a thistle.,22
this Benedictus.,22
meant plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance,22
not such a fool to think what I list nor I list,22
if I would think my heart out of thinking that you,22
can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another and,22
marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats,22
converted I know not but methinks you look with,22
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?,22
Re-enter URSULA,22
Benedick Don John and all the gallants of the,22
Help to dress me good coz good Meg good Ursula.,22
SCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.,22
What would you with me honest neighbour?,22
that decerns you nearly.,22
Marry this it is sir.,22
What is it my good friends?,22
matter: an old man sir and his wits are not so,22
in faith honest as the skin between his brows.,22
that is an old man and no honester than I.,22
Neighbours you are tedious.,22
poor duke's officers; but truly for mine own part,22
my heart to bestow it all of your worship.,22
Yea an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for,22
man in the city; and though I be but a poor man I,22
And so am I.,22
Marry sir our watch to-night excepting your,22
knaves as any in Messina.,22
say when the age is in the wit is out: God help,22
neighbour Verges: well God's a good man; an two men,22
soul i' faith sir; by my troth he is as ever,22
are not alike; alas good neighbour!,22
Gifts that God gives.,22
One word sir: our watch sir have indeed,22
have them this morning examined before your worship.,22
am now in great haste as it may appear unto you.,22
Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.,22
My lord they stay for you to give your daughter to,22
I'll wait upon them: I am ready.,22
Go good partner go get you to Francis Seacole;,22
are now to examination these men.,22
We will spare for no wit I warrant you; here's,22
get the learned writer to set down our,22
Exeunt,22
SCENE I. A church.,22
Come Friar Francis be brief; only to the plain,22
particular duties afterwards.,22
No.,22
Lady you come hither to be married to this count.,22
If either of you know any inward impediment why you,22
to utter it.,22
None my lord.,22
I dare make his answer none.,22
do not knowing what they do!,22
laughing as ah ha he!,22
Will you with free and unconstrained soul,22
As freely son as God did give her me.,22
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?,22
Sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness.,22
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;,22
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!,22
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!,22
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,22
By these exterior shows? But she is none:,22
Her blush is guiltiness not modesty.,22
Not to be married,22
Dear my lord if you in your own proof,22
And made defeat of her virginity--,22
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,22
No Leonato,22
But as a brother to his sister show'd,22
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?,22
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,22
But you are more intemperate in your blood,22
That rage in savage sensuality.,22
Sweet prince why speak not you?,22
I stand dishonour'd that have gone about,22
Are these things spoken or do I but dream?,22
This looks not like a nuptial.,22
Leonato stand I here?,22
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?,22
Let me but move one question to your daughter;,22
That you have in her bid her answer truly.,22
O God defend me! how am I beset!,22
To make you answer truly to your name.,22
With any just reproach?,22
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.,22
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?,22
I talk'd with no man at that hour my lord.,22
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,22
Did see her hear her at that hour last night,22
Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain,22
A thousand times in secret.,22
Not to be spoke of;,22
Without offence to utter them. Thus pretty lady,22
O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been,22
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!,22
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!,22
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,22
And never shall it more be gracious.,22
HERO swoons,22
Come let us go. These things come thus to light,22
Exeunt DON PEDRO DON JOHN and CLAUDIO,22
Dead I think. Help uncle!,22
O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.,22
That may be wish'd for.,22
Have comfort lady.,22
Yea wherefore should she not?,22
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny,22
Do not live Hero; do not ope thine eyes:,22
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,22
Strike at thy life. Grieved I I had but one?,22
O one too much by thee! Why had I one?,22
Why had I not with charitable hand,22
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,22
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?,22
And mine that I was proud on mine so much,22
Valuing of her--why she O she is fallen,22
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,22
To her foul-tainted flesh!,22
For my part I am so attired in wonder,22
O on my soul my cousin is belied!,22
No truly not; although until last night,22
Confirm'd confirm'd! O that is stronger made,22
Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie,22
Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.,22
For I have only been silent so long,22
...,22
A thousand blushing apparitions,22
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;,22
To burn the errors that these princes hold,22
Trust not my reading nor my observations,22
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,22
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here,22
Friar it cannot be.,22
Is that she will not add to her damnation,22
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse,22
Lady what man is he you are accused of?,22
If I know more of any man alive,22
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,22
At hours unmeet or that I yesternight,22
Refuse me hate me torture me to death!,22
Two of them have the very bent of honour;,22
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,22
I know not. If they speak but truth of her,22
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.,22
Nor age so eat up my invention,22
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,22
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,22
To quit me of them throughly.,22
And let my counsel sway you in this case.,22
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,22
Maintain a mourning ostentation,22
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites,22
What shall become of this? what will this do?,22
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:,22
But on this travail look for greater birth.,22
Upon the instant that she was accused,22
Of every hearer: for it so falls out,22
Whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost,22
The virtue that possession would not show us,22
When he shall hear she died upon his words,22
Into his study of imagination,22
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,22
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,22
If ever love had interest in his liver,22
No though he thought his accusation true.,22
Will fashion the event in better shape,22
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,22
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:,22
As best befits her wounded reputation,22
Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries.,22
And though you know my inwardness and love,22
Yet by mine honour I will deal in this,22
Should with your body.,22
The smallest twine may lead me.,22
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.,22
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.,22
Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while?,22
I will not desire that.,22
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.,22
Is there any way to show such friendship?,22
May a man do it?,22
I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is,22
As strange as the thing I know not. It were as,22
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I,22
By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me.,22
I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make,22
Will you not eat your word?,22
I love thee.,22
What offence sweet Beatrice?,22
protest I loved you.,22
I love you with so much of my heart that none is,22
Come bid me do any thing for thee.,22
Ha! not for the wide world.,22
Tarry sweet Beatrice.,22
you: nay I pray you let me go.,22
In faith I will go.,22
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.,22
Is he not approved in the height a villain that,22
that I were a man! What bear her in hand until they,22
accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour,22
in the market-place.,22
Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!,22
Sweet Hero! She is wronged she is slandered she is undone.,22
Princes and counties! Surely a princely testimony,22
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I,22
manhood is melted into courtesies valour into,22
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules,22
man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving.,22
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.,22
Yea as sure as I have a thought or a soul.,22
kiss your hand and so I leave you. By this hand,22
hear of me so think of me. Go comfort your,22
Exeunt,22
Enter DOGBERRY VERGES and Sexton in gowns; and the Watch with CONRADE and BORACHIO,22
O a stool and a cushion for the sexton.,22
Marry that am I and my partner.,22
But which are the offenders that are to be,22
Yea marry let them come before me. What is your,22
Borachio.,22
I am a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade.,22
you serve God?,22
Write down that they hope they serve God: and,22
before such villains! Masters it is proved already,22
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer,22
Marry sir we say we are none.,22
will go about with him. Come you hither sirrah; a,22
you are false knaves.,22
Well stand aside. 'Fore God they are both in a,22
Master constable you go not the way to examine:,22
Yea marry that's the eftest way. Let the watch,22
name accuse these men.,22
brother was a villain.,22
perjury to call a prince's brother villain.,22
Pray thee fellow peace: I do not like thy look,22
What heard you him say else?,22
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.,22
Yea by mass that it is.,22
And that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to,22
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting,22
What else?,22
And this is more masters than you can deny.,22
Hero was in this manner accused in this very manner,22
Master constable let these men be bound and,22
him their examination.,22
Come let them be opinioned.,22
Off coxcomb!,22
down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come bind them.,22
Away! you are an ass you are an ass.,22
suspect my years? O that he were here to write me,22
ass; though it be not written down yet forget not,22
piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.,22
and which is more a householder and which is,22
Messina and one that knows the law go to; and a,22
had losses and one that hath two gowns and every,22
I had been writ down an ass!,22
ACT V,22
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO,22
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief,22
I pray thee cease thy counsel,22
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;,22
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.,22
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,22
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,22
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,22
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,22
Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk,22
And I of him will gather patience.,22
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief,22
Their counsel turns to passion which before,22
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,22
No no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience,22
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency,22
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:,22
Therein do men from children nothing differ.,22
For there was never yet philosopher,22
However they have writ the style of gods,22
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;,22
There thou speak'st reason: nay I will do so.,22
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince,22
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.,22
Good den good den.,22
Hear you. my lords--,22
Some haste my lord! well fare you well my lord:,22
Nay do not quarrel with us good old man.,22
Some of us would lie low.,22
Marry thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler thou:--,22
I fear thee not.,22
If it should give your age such cause of fear:,22
Tush tush man; never fleer and jest at me:,22
As under privilege of age to brag,22
Were I not old. Know Claudio to thy head,22
That I am forced to lay my reverence by,22
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.,22
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,22
O in a tomb where never scandal slept,22
My villany?,22
You say not right old man.,22
I'll prove it on his body if he dare,22
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.,22
Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:,22
He shall kill two of us and men indeed:,22
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.,22
Sir boy I'll whip you from your foining fence;,22
Brother--,22
And she is dead slander'd to death by villains,22
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:,22
Brother Antony--,22
And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple--,22
That lie and cog and flout deprave and slander,22
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,22
And this is all.,22
Come 'tis no matter:,22
Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience.,22
But on my honour she was charged with nothing,22
My lord my lord--,22
No? Come brother; away! I will be heard.,22
Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO,22
Enter BENEDICK,22
Good day my lord.,22
almost a fray.,22
with two old men without teeth.,22
we fought I doubt we should have been too young for them.,22
to seek you both.,22
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten,22
It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?,22
Never any did so though very many have been beside,22
minstrels; draw to pleasure us.,22
sick or angry?,22
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.,22
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.,22
broke cross.,22
he be angry indeed.,22
Shall I speak a word in your ear?,22
[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:,22
dare and when you dare. Do me right or I will,22
lady and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me,22
Well I will meet you so I may have good cheer.,22
I' faith I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's,22
curiously say my knife's naught. Shall I not find,22
Sir your wit ambles well; it goes easily.,22
other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit: 'True',22
great wit:' 'Right' says she 'a great gross one.',22
hurts nobody.' 'Nay' said I 'the gentleman,22
Nay' said I 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I,22
Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning;,22
did she an hour together transshape thy particular,22
wast the properest man in Italy.,22
not.,22
did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly:,22
All all; and moreover God saw him when he was,22
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on,22
Yea and text underneath 'Here dwells Benedick the,22
Fare you well boy: you know my mind. I will leave,22
as braggarts do their blades which God be thanked,22
you: I must discontinue your company: your brother,22

He is in earnest.,22

Most sincerely.,22

be sad. Did he not say my brother was fled?,22
Come you sir: if justice cannot tame you she,22
an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to.,22
one!,22
Officers what offence have these men done?,22
moreover they have spoken untruths; secondarily,22
belied a lady; thirdly they have verified unjust,22
First I ask thee what they have done; thirdly I,22
they are committed; and to conclude what you lay,22
Rightly reasoned and in his own division: and by,22
Who have you offended masters that you are thus,22
too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?,22
do you hear me and let this count kill me. I have,22
could not discover these shallow fools have brought,22
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me,22
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's,22
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which,22
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my,22
nothing but the reward of a villain.,22
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.,22
Yea and paid me richly for the practise of it.,22
And fled he is upon this villany.,22
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.,22
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:,22
and place shall serve that I am an ass.,22
Sexton too.,22
Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,22
I may avoid him: which of these is he?,22
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd,22
Yea even I alone.,22
Here stand a pair of honourable men;,22
I thank you princes for my daughter's death:,22
Twas bravely done if you bethink you of it.,22
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;,22
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not,22
By my soul nor I:,22
I would bend under any heavy weight,22
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;,22
Possess the people in Messina here,22
Can labour ought in sad invention,22
And sing it to her bones sing it to-night:,22
And since you could not be my son-in-law,22
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,22
Give her the right you should have given her cousin,22
O noble sir,22
I do embrace your offer; and dispose,22
To-morrow then I will expect your coming;,22
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,22
Hired to it by your brother.,22
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,22
In any thing that I do know by her.,22
black this plaintiff here the offender did call,22
punishment. And also the watch heard them talk of,22
a lock hanging by it and borrows money in God's,22
that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing,22
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.,22
reverend youth; and I praise God for you.,22
God save the foundation!,22
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I,22
example of others. God keep your worship! I wish,22
humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry,22
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES,22
Farewell my lords: we look for you to-morrow.,22
To-night I'll mourn with Hero.,22
talk with Margaret,22
Exeunt severally,22
Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET meeting,22
my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.,22
In so high a style Margaret that no man living,22
deservest it.,22
keep below stairs?,22
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit,22
A most manly wit Margaret; it will not hurt a,22
thee the bucklers.,22
If you use them Margaret you must put in the,22
Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs.,22
Exit MARGARET,22
The god of love,22
And knows me and knows me,22
I mean in singing; but in loving Leander the good,22
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,22
blank verse why they were never so truly turned,22
cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find,22
rhyme; for 'scorn' 'horn' a hard rhyme; for,22
endings: no I was not born under a rhyming planet,22
Enter BEATRICE,22
Yea signior and depart when you bid me.,22
Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet ere,22
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.,22
Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but,22
will depart unkissed.,22
so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee,22
I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe,22
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?,22
a state of evil that they will not admit any good,22
good parts did you first suffer love for me?,22
indeed for I love thee against my will.,22
If you spite it for my sake I will spite it for,22
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.,22
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.,22
the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect,22
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the,22
And how long is that think you?,22
rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the,22
impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his,22
praising myself who I myself will bear witness is,22
Very ill.,22
Very ill too.,22
you too for here comes one in haste.,22
Madam you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old,22
falsely accused the prince and Claudio mightily,22
fed and gone. Will you come presently?,22
I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be,22
thee to thy uncle's.,22
SCENE III. A church.,22
Is this the monument of Leonato?,22
[Reading out of a scroll],22
Was the Hero that here lies:,22
Gives her fame which never dies.,22
Lives in death with glorious fame.,22
Praising her when I am dumb.,22
SONG.,22
Those that slew thy virgin knight;,22
Round about her tomb they go.,22
Help us to sigh and groan,22
Graves yawn and yield your dead,22
Heavily heavily.,22
Yearly will I do this rite.,22
The wolves have prey'd; and look the gentle day,22
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.,22
Good morrow masters: each his several way.,22
And then to Leonato's we will go.,22
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.,22
SCENE IV. A room in LEONATO'S house.,22
Did I not tell you she was innocent?,22
Upon the error that you heard debated:,22
Although against her will as it appears,22
Well I am glad that all things sort so well.,22
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.,22
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,22
Exeunt Ladies,22
To visit me. You know your office brother:,22
And give her to young Claudio.,22
Friar I must entreat your pains I think.,22
To bind me or undo me; one of them.,22
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.,22
And I do with an eye of love requite her.,22
From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?,22
But for my will my will is your good will,22
In the state of honourable marriage:,22
My heart is with your liking.,22
Here comes the prince and Claudio.,22
Good morrow to this fair assembly.,22
We here attend you. Are you yet determined,22
I'll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.,22
Exit ANTONIO,22
That you have such a February face,22
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.,22
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,22
When he would play the noble beast in love.,22
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,22
Much like to you for you have just his bleat.,22
Re-enter ANTONIO with the Ladies masked,22
This same is she and I do give you her.,22
No that you shall not till you take her hand,22
Give me your hand: before this holy friar,22
And when I lived I was your other wife:,22
And when you loved you were my other husband.,22
Nothing certainer:,22
And surely as I live I am a maid.,22
She died my lord but whiles her slander lived.,22
When after that the holy rites are ended,22
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,22
Soft and fair friar. Which is Beatrice?,22
Do not you love me?,22
Why then your uncle and the prince and Claudio,22
Do not you love me?,22
Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula,22
They swore that you were almost sick for me.,22
Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?,22
Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman.,22
For here's a paper written in his hand,22
Fashion'd to Beatrice.,22
Writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket,22
A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.,22
thee for pity.,22
upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,22
Peace! I will stop your mouth.,22
How dost thou Benedick the married man?,22
wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost,22
if a man will be beaten with brains a' shall wear,22
purpose to marry I will think nothing to any,22
therefore never flout at me for what I have said,22
conclusion. For thy part Claudio I did think to,22
kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin.,22
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single,22
question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look,22
Come come we are friends: let's have a dance ere,22
and our wives' heels.,22
First of my word; therefore play music. Prince,22
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.,22
My lord your brother John is ta'en in flight,22
Think not on him till to-morrow:,22
Strike up pipers.,22
Exeunt,22
SCENE I. Venice. A street.,23
Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly,23
As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this.,23
If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor me.,23
Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,23
Off-capp'd to him: and by the faith of man,23
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,23
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;,23
Nonsuits my mediators; for 'Certes' says he,23
And what was he?,23
One Michael Cassio a Florentine,23
That never set a squadron in the field,23
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,23
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practise,23
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof,23
Christian and heathen must be be-lee'd and calm'd,23
He in good time must his lieutenant be,23
By heaven I rather would have been his hangman.,23
Preferment goes by letter and affection,23
Stood heir to the first. Now sir be judge yourself,23
To love the Moor.,23
O sir content you;,23
We cannot all be masters nor all masters,23
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,23
Wears out his time much like his master's ass,23
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are,23
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,23
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined,23
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;,23
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,23
In following him I follow but myself;,23
But seeming so for my peculiar end:,23
The native act and figure of my heart,23
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve,23
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe,23
Call up her father,23
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,23
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,23
As it may lose some colour.,23
Do with like timorous accent and dire yell,23
Is spied in populous cities.,23
Awake! what ho Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!,23
Thieves! thieves!,23
What is the reason of this terrible summons?,23
Signior is all your family within?,23
Why wherefore ask you this?,23
your gown;,23
Even now now very now an old black ram,23
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,23
Arise I say.,23
Most reverend signior do you know my voice?,23
My name is Roderigo.,23
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:,23
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,23
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come,23
Sir sir sir--,23
My spirit and my place have in them power,23
Patience good sir.,23
My house is not a grange.,23
In simple and pure soul I come to you.,23
serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to,23
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;,23
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.,23
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter,23
Thou art a villain.,23
This thou shalt answer; I know thee Roderigo.,23
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,23
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,23
But with a knave of common hire a gondolier,23
If this be known to you and your allowance,23
But if you know not this my manners tell me,23
That from the sense of all civility,23
Your daughter if you have not given her leave,23
Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes,23
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:,23
Let loose on me the justice of the state,23
Strike on the tinder ho!,23
This accident is not unlike my dream:,23
Light I say! light!,23
Farewell; for I must leave you:,23
To be produced--as if I stay I shall--,23
However this may gall him with some cheque,23
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,23
Another of his fathom they have none,23
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.,23
I must show out a flag and sign of love,23
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;,23
Exit,23
It is too true an evil: gone she is;,23
Is nought but bitterness. Now Roderigo,23
With the Moor say'st thou? Who would be a father!,23
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:,23
Truly I think they are.,23
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds,23
By which the property of youth and maidhood,23
Of some such thing?,23
Call up my brother. O would you had had her!,23
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?,23
To get good guard and go along with me.,23
I may command at most. Get weapons ho!,23
On good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.,23
SCENE II. Another street.,23
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,23
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity,23
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.,23
Nay but he prated,23
Against your honour,23
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you sir,23
That the magnifico is much beloved,23
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;,23
The law with all his might to enforce it on,23
Let him do his spite:,23
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know--,23
I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being,23
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune,23
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,23
Put into circumscription and confine,23
Those are the raised father and his friends:,23
Not I I must be found:,23
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?,23
Enter CASSIO and certain Officers with torches,23
The goodness of the night upon you friends!,23
The duke does greet you general,23
Even on the instant.,23
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:,23
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers,23
And many of the consuls raised and met,23
hotly call'd for;,23
The senate hath sent about three several guests,23
Tis well I am found by you.,23
And go with you.,23
Ancient what makes he here?,23
If it prove lawful prize he's made for ever.,23
He's married.,23
Re-enter OTHELLO,23
Have with you.,23
It is Brabantio. General be advised;,23
Enter BRABANTIO RODERIGO and Officers with torches and weapons,23
Signior it is the Moor.,23
They draw on both sides,23
Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them.,23
Than with your weapons.,23
Damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her;,23
If she in chains of magic were not bound,23
So opposite to marriage that she shunned,23
Would ever have to incur a general mock,23
Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight.,23
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,23
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;,23
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,23
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.,23
Subdue him at his peril.,23
Both you of my inclining and the rest:,23
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go,23
To prison till fit time,23
Call thee to answer.,23
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,23
Upon some present business of the state,23
Tis true most worthy signior;,23
I am sure is sent for.,23
In this time of the night! Bring him away:,23
Or any of my brothers of the state,23
For if such actions may have passage free,23
Exeunt,23
The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending,23
That gives them credit.,23
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.,23
And mine two hundred:,23
As in these cases where the aim reports,23
A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus.,23
I do not so secure me in the error,23
In fearful sense.,23
A messenger from the galleys.,23
Now what's the business?,23
So was I bid report here to the state,23
How say you by this change?,23
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,23
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,23
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,23
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,23
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,23
To leave that latest which concerns him first,23
To wake and wage a danger profitless.,23
Here is more news.,23
The Ottomites reverend and gracious,23
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.,23
Of thirty sail: and now they do restem,23
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,23
With his free duty recommends you thus,23
Tis certain then for Cyprus.,23
He's now in Florence.,23
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.,23
Valiant Othello we must straight employ you,23
To BRABANTIO,23
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.,23
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business,23
Take hold on me for my particular grief,23
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,23
Why what's the matter?,23
Dead?,23
She is abused stol'n from me and corrupted,23
For nature so preposterously to err,23
Sans witchcraft could not.,23
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself,23
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,23
Stood in your action.,23
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems,23
Hath hither brought.,23
[To OTHELLO]  What in your own part can you say to this?,23
Most potent grave and reverend signiors,23
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,23
The very head and front of my offending,23
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:,23
Till now some nine moons wasted they have used,23
And little of this great world can I speak,23
And therefore little shall I grace my cause,23
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver,23
What conjuration and what mighty magic,23
I won his daughter.,23
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion,23
Of years of country credit every thing,23
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect,23
Against all rules of nature and must be driven,23
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again,23
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,23
To vouch this is no proof,23
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods,23
But Othello speak:,23
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?,23
As soul to soul affordeth?,23
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,23
If you do find me foul in her report,23
Not only take away but let your sentence,23
Fetch Desdemona hither.,23
Exeunt IAGO and Attendants,23
I do confess the vices of my blood,23
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,23
Say it Othello.,23
Still question'd me the story of my life,23
That I have passed.,23
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;,23
Of moving accidents by flood and field,23
Of being taken by the insolent foe,23
And portance in my travels' history:,23
Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,23
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,23
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear,23
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:,23
She'ld come again and with a greedy ear,23
Took once a pliant hour and found good means,23
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,23
But not intentively: I did consent,23
When I did speak of some distressful stroke,23
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:,23
Twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful:,23
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,23
I should but teach him how to tell my story.,23
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,23
This only is the witchcraft I have used:,23
Enter DESDEMONA IAGO and Attendants,23
Good Brabantio,23
Men do their broken weapons rather use,23
I pray you hear her speak:,23
Destruction on my head if my bad blame,23
Do you perceive in all this noble company,23
My noble father,23
To you I am bound for life and education;,23
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;,23
And so much duty as my mother show'd,23
So much I challenge that I may profess,23
God be wi' you! I have done.,23
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.,23
I here do give thee that with all my heart,23
I would keep from thee. For your sake jewel,23
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,23
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,23
Into your favour.,23
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended.,23
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.,23
Patience her injury a mockery makes.,23
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.,23
We lose it not so long as we can smile.,23
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,23
That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow.,23
Being strong on both sides are equivocal:,23
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.,23
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for,23
known to you; and though we have there a substitute,23
sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer,23
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this,23
The tyrant custom most grave senators,23
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise,23
I find in hardness and do undertake,23
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,23
Due reference of place and exhibition,23
As levels with her breeding.,23
Be't at her father's.,23
Nor I.,23
To put my father in impatient thoughts,23
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;,23
To assist my simpleness.,23
That I did love the Moor to live with him,23
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued,23
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,23
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.,23
A moth of peace and he go to the war,23
And I a heavy interim shall support,23
Let her have your voices.,23
To please the palate of my appetite,23
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.,23
And heaven defend your good souls that you think,23
For she is with me: no when light-wing'd toys,23
My speculative and officed instruments,23
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,23
Make head against my estimation!,23
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,23
You must away to-night.,23
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.,23
And he shall our commission bring to you;,23
As doth import you.,23
A man he is of honest and trust:,23
With what else needful your good grace shall think,23
Let it be so.,23
To BRABANTIO,23
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,23
Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well.,23
She has deceived her father and may thee.,23
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,23
I prithee let thy wife attend on her:,23
Come Desdemona: I have but an hour,23
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.,23
Iago--,23
What will I do thinkest thou?,23
I will incontinently drown myself.,23
thou silly gentleman!,23
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.,23
times seven years; and since I could distinguish,23
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I,23
would change my humanity with a baboon.,23
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.,23
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens to the which,23
nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up,23
distract it with many either to have it sterile,23
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our,23
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the,23
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have,23
stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that,23
It cannot be.,23
the will. Come be a man. Drown thyself! drown,23
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with,23
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy,23
an usurped beard; I say put money in thy purse. It,23
love to the Moor-- put money in thy purse--nor he,23
shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but,23
their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food,23
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must,23
she will find the error of her choice: she must,23
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a,23
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt,23
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou,23
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek,23
to be drowned and go without her.,23
the issue?,23
thee often and I re-tell thee again and again I,23
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge,23
thyself a pleasure me a sport. There are many,23
Traverse! go provide thy money. We will have more,23
Where shall we meet i' the morning?,23
I'll be with thee betimes.,23
What say you?,23
I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.,23
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:,23
If I would time expend with such a snipe.,23
And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets,23
But I for mere suspicion in that kind,23
The better shall my purpose work on him.,23
To get his place and to plume up my will,23
After some time to abuse Othello's ear,23
He hath a person and a smooth dispose,23
The Moor is of a free and open nature,23
And will as tenderly be led by the nose,23
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night,23
Exit,23
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.,23
What from the cape can you discern at sea?,23
I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main,23
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;,23
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,23
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?,23
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,23
The wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous mane,23
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:,23
On the enchafed flood.,23
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd:,23
Enter a third Gentleman,23
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,23
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance,23
How! is this true?,23
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,23
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,23
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.,23
Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly,23
With foul and violent tempest.,23
For I have served him and the man commands,23
As well to see the vessel that's come in,23
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue,23
Come let's do so:,23
Of more arrivance.,23
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle,23
Give him defence against the elements,23
Is he well shipp'd?,23
Of very expert and approved allowance;,23
Stand in bold cure.,23
Enter a fourth Gentleman,23
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea,23
My hopes do shape him for the governor.,23
They do discharge their shot of courtesy:,23
I pray you sir go forth,23
I shall.,23
But good lieutenant is your general wived?,23
That paragons description and wild fame;,23
And in the essential vesture of creation,23
Re-enter second Gentleman,23
Tis one Iago ancient to the general.,23
Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds,23
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel--,23
Their mortal natures letting go safely by,23
What is she?,23
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,23
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove Othello guard,23
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,23
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,23
Enter DESDEMONA EMILIA IAGO RODERIGO and Attendants,23
The riches of the ship is come on shore!,23
Hail to thee lady! and the grace of heaven,23
Enwheel thee round!,23
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?,23
But that he's well and will be shortly here.,23
The great contention of the sea and skies,23
Within 'A sail a sail!' Guns heard,23
This likewise is a friend.,23
Exit Gentleman,23
To EMILIA,23
Let it not gall your patience good Iago,23
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.,23
Sir would she give you so much of her lips,23
You'll have enough.,23
In faith too much;,23
Marry before your ladyship I grant,23
And chides with thinking.,23
Come on come on; you are pictures out of doors,23
Saints m your injuries devils being offended,23
O fie upon thee slanderer!,23
You rise to play and go to bed to work.,23
No let me not.,23
praise me?,23
For I am nothing if not critical.,23
Ay madam.,23
The thing I am by seeming otherwise.,23
I am about it; but indeed my invention,23
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,23
If she be fair and wise fairness and wit,23
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?,23
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.,23
How if fair and foolish?,23
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.,23
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for,23
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,23
O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.,23
woman indeed one that in the authority of her,23
She that was ever fair and never proud,23
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,23
She that being anger'd her revenge being nigh,23
She that in wisdom never was so frail,23
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,23
She was a wight if ever such wight were--,23
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.,23
of him Emilia though he be thy husband. How say,23
counsellor?,23
the soldier than in the scholar.,23
whisper: with as little a web as this will I,23
her do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.,23
these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had,23
oft which now again you are most apt to play the,23
courtesy! 'tis so indeed. Yet again your fingers,23
Trumpet within,23
Tis truly so.,23
Lo where he comes!,23
O my fair warrior!,23
It gives me wonder great as my content,23
If after every tempest come such calms,23
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas,23
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,23
My soul hath her content so absolute,23
Succeeds in unknown fate.,23
But that our loves and comforts should increase,23
Amen to that sweet powers!,23
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:,23
Kissing her,23
[Aside]  O you are well tuned now!,23
As honest as I am.,23
News friends; our wars are done the Turks,23
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?,23
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,23
In mine own comforts. I prithee good Iago,23
Bring thou the master to the citadel;,23
Does challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,23
Exeunt OTHELLO DESDEMONA and Attendants,23
hither. If thou be'st valiant-- as they say base,23
natures more than is native to them--list me. The,23
guard:--first I must tell thee this--Desdemona is,23
With him! why 'tis not possible.,23
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,23
and will she love him still for prating? let not,23
and what delight shall she have to look on the,23
sport there should be again to inflame it and to,23
sympathy in years manners and beauties; all which,23
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will,23
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will,23
choice. Now sir this granted--as it is a most,23
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio,23
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of,23
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,23
finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and,23
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides the,23
requisites in him that folly and green minds look,23
hath found him already.,23
most blessed condition.,23
grapes: if she had been blessed she would never,23
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst,23
Yes that I did; but that was but courtesy.,23
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met,23
together. Villanous thoughts Roderigo! when these,23
the master and main exercise the incorporate,23
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;,23
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find,23
too loud or tainting his discipline; or from what,23
favourably minister.,23
Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply,23
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to,23
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So,23
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the,23
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.,23
opportunity.,23
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.,23
Exit,23
That she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit:,23
Is of a constant loving noble nature,23
A most dear husband. Now I do love her too;,23
I stand accountant for as great a sin,23
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor,23
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards;,23
Till I am even'd with him wife for wife,23
At least into a jealousy so strong,23
If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash,23
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,23
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--,23
For making him egregiously an ass,23
Even to madness. 'Tis here but yet confused:,23
Exit,23
Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following,23
general that upon certain tidings now arrived,23
every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,23
revels his addiction leads him: for besides these,23
nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be,23
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five,23
isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!,23
SCENE III. A hall in the castle.,23
Good Michael look you to the guard to-night:,23
Not to outsport discretion.,23
But notwithstanding with my personal eye,23
Iago is most honest.,23
Let me have speech with you.,23
Come my dear love,23
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.,23
Exeunt OTHELLO DESDEMONA and Attendants,23
Welcome Iago; we must to the watch.,23
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love,23
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and,23
She's a most exquisite lady.,23
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.,23
provocation.,23
And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love?,23
Well happiness to their sheets! Come lieutenant I,23
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to,23
Not to-night good Iago: I have very poor and,23
courtesy would invent some other custom of,23
O they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for,23
I have drunk but one cup to-night and that was,23
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,23
What man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants,23
Where are they?,23
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.,23
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,23
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence,23
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,23
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:,23
That hold their honours in a wary distance,23
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,23
Am I to put our Cassio in some action,23
If consequence do but approve my dream,23
Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine,23
Good faith a little one; not past a pint as I am,23
Some wine ho!,23
And let me the canakin clink clink;,23
A soldier's a man;,23
Why then let a soldier drink.,23
Fore God an excellent song.,23
most potent in potting: your Dane your German and,23
to your English.,23
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead,23
gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle,23
To the health of our general!,23
O sweet England!,23
His breeches cost him but a crown;,23
With that he call'd the tailor lown.,23
And thou art but of low degree:,23
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.,23
Why this is a more exquisite song than the other.,23
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that,23
be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved.,23
For mine own part--no offence to the general nor,23
And so do I too lieutenant.,23
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's,23
us our sins!--Gentlemen let's look to our business.,23
ancient; this is my right hand and this is my left:,23
speak well enough.,23
Why very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.,23
To the platform masters; come let's set the watch.,23
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar,23
Tis to his virtue a just equinox,23
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.,23
Will shake this island.,23
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:,23
If drink rock not his cradle.,23
The general were put in mind of it.,23
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,23
Enter RODERIGO,23
I pray you after the lieutenant; go.,23
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor,23
With one of an ingraft infirmity:,23
So to the Moor.,23
I do love Cassio well; and would do much,23
Cry within: 'Help! help!',23
You rogue! you rascal!,23
A knave teach me my duty!,23
Beat me!,23
Striking RODERIGO,23
Staying him,23
Let me go sir,23
Come come,23
Drunk!,23
[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away I say; go out and cry a mutiny.,23
Nay good lieutenant--alas gentlemen;--,23
Help masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!,23
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo ho!,23
You will be shamed for ever.,23
What is the matter here?,23
Faints,23
Hold ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--gentlemen--,23
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold hold for shame!,23
Are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do that,23
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl:,23
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.,23
From her propriety. What is the matter masters?,23
Speak who began this? on thy love I charge thee.,23
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom,23
As if some planet had unwitted men--,23
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak,23
And would in action glorious I had lost,23
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot?,23
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil;,23
The world hath noted and your name is great,23
That you unlace your reputation thus,23
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.,23
Your officer Iago can inform you--,23
offends me--,23
By me that's said or done amiss this night;,23
And to defend ourselves it be a sin,23
Now by heaven,23
And passion having my best judgment collied,23
Or do but lift this arm the best of you,23
How this foul rout began who set it on;,23
Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth,23
Yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear,23
In night and on the court and guard of safety!,23
If partially affined or leagued in office,23
Thou art no soldier.,23
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth,23
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth,23
Montano and myself being in speech,23
And Cassio following him with determined sword,23
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause:,23
Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--,23
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather,23
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night,23
For this was brief--I found them close together,23
When you yourself did part them.,23
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:,23
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,23
From him that fled some strange indignity,23
I know Iago,23
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio I love thee,23
Re-enter DESDEMONA attended,23
I'll make thee an example.,23
All's well now sweeting; come away to bed.,23
Lead him off.,23
Iago look with care about the town,23
Come Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life,23
Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO,23
Ay past all surgery.,23
Reputation reputation reputation! O I have lost,23
myself and what remains is bestial. My reputation,23
As I am an honest man I thought you had received,23
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false,23
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,23
there are ways to recover the general again: you,23
policy than in malice even so as one would beat his,23
to him again and he's yours.,23
good a commander with so slight so drunken and so,23
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse,23
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by,23
What was he that you followed with your sword? What,23
I know not.,23
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly;,23
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away,23
revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts!,23
recovered?,23
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me,23
Come you are too severe a moraler: as the time,23
stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen;,23
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me,23
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a,23
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is,23
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature,23
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you.,23
You or any man living may be drunk! at a time man.,23
is now the general: may say so in this respect for,23
contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and,23
her help to put you in your place again: she is of,23
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more,23
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my,23
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.,23
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.,23
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:,23
You are in the right. Good night lieutenant; I,23
CASSIO: Good night honest Iago.,23
And what's he then that says I play the villain?,23
Probal to thinking and indeed the course,23
The inclining Desdemona to subdue,23
As the free elements. And then for her,23
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,23
That she may make unmake do what she list,23
With his weak function. How am I then a villain,23
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!,23
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,23
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,23
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,23
And by how much she strives to do him good,23
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,23
That shall enmesh them all.,23
How now Roderigo!,23
hunts but one that fills up the cry. My money is,23
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be I shall,23
no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice.,23
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?,23
And wit depends on dilatory time.,23
And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio:,23
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:,23
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.,23
Away I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:,23
Exit RODERIGO,23
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;,23
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,23
Soliciting his wife: ay that's the way,23
Exit,23
SCENE I. Before the castle.,23
Masters play here; I will content your pains;,23
Music,23
Why masters have your instruments been in Naples,23
How sir how!,23
Ay marry are they sir.,23
Whereby hangs a tale sir?,23
But masters here's money for you: and the general,23
sake to make no more noise with it.,23
If you have any music that may not be heard to't,23
does not greatly care.,23
Then put up your pipes in your bag for I'll away:,23
Exeunt Musicians,23
No I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.,23
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends,23
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:,23
She is stirring sir: if she will stir hither I,23
Do good my friend.,23
Enter IAGO,23
You have not been a-bed then?,23
Before we parted. I have made bold Iago,23
Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona,23
I'll send her to you presently;,23
Out of the way that your converse and business,23
I humbly thank you for't.,23
I never knew,23
Enter EMILIA,23
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.,23
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,23
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom,23
And needs no other suitor but his likings,23
To bring you in again.,23
If you think fit or that it may be done,23
With Desdemona alone.,23
I will bestow you where you shall have time,23
I am much bound to you.,23
SCENE II. A room in the castle.,23
These letters give Iago to the pilot;,23
That done I will be walking on the works;,23
Well my good lord I'll do't.,23
We'll wait upon your lordship.,23
SCENE III. The garden of the castle.,23
Be thou assured good Cassio I will do,23
Good madam do: I warrant it grieves my husband,23
O that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt Cassio,23
As friendly as you were.,23
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,23
I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:,23
He shall in strangeness stand no further off,23
Ay but lady,23
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,23
That I being absent and my place supplied,23
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here,23
If I do vow a friendship I'll perform it,23
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;,23
I'll intermingle every thing he does,23
For thy solicitor shall rather die,23
Madam here comes my lord.,23
Why stay and hear me speak.,23
Unfit for mine own purposes.,23
Exit CASSIO,23
Ha! I like not that.,23
Nothing my lord: or if--I know not what.,23
Cassio my lord! No sure I cannot think it,23
Seeing you coming.,23
How now my lord!,23
A man that languishes in your displeasure.,23
Why your lieutenant Cassio. Good my lord,23
His present reconciliation take;,23
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,23
I prithee call him back.,23
Ay sooth; so humbled,23
To suffer with him. Good love call him back.,23
But shall't be shortly?,23
Shall't be to-night at supper?,23
To-morrow dinner then?,23
I meet the captains at the citadel.,23
On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn:,23
Exceed three days: in faith he's penitent;,23
Save that they say the wars must make examples,23
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?,23
What you would ask me that I should deny,23
That came a-wooing with you and so many a time,23
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do,23
Prithee no more: let him come when he will;,23
Why this is not a boon;,23
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm,23
To your own person: nay when I have a suit,23
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,23
I will deny thee nothing:,23
To leave me but a little to myself.,23
Farewell my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.,23
Whate'er you be I am obedient.,23
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,23
Chaos is come again.,23
What dost thou say Iago?,23
Know of your love?,23
But for a satisfaction of my thought;,23
Why of thy thought Iago?,23
O yes; and went between us very oft.,23
Indeed! ay indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?,23
Honest my lord!,23
My lord for aught I know.,23
Think my lord!,23
By heaven he echoes me,23
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:,23
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?,23
In my whole course of wooing thou criedst 'Indeed!',23
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain,23
Show me thy thought.,23
I think thou dost;,23
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,23
For such things in a false disloyal knave,23
They are close delations working from the heart,23
For Michael Cassio,23
I think so too.,23
Or those that be not would they might seem none!,23
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.,23
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,23
The worst of words.,23
Though I am bound to every act of duty,23
Utter my thoughts? Why say they are vile and false;,23
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,23
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit,23
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago,23
A stranger to thy thoughts.,23
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,23
To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy,23
From one that so imperfectly conceits,23
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.,23
Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom,23
What dost thou mean?,23
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:,23
Twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands:,23
Robs me of that which not enriches him,23
By heaven I'll know thy thoughts.,23
Nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody.,23
O beware my lord of jealousy;,23
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss,23
But O what damned minutes tells he o'er,23
O misery!,23
But riches fineless is as poor as winter,23
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend,23
Why why is this?,23
To follow still the changes of the moon,23
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,23
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,23
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company,23
Where virtue is these are more virtuous:,23
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;,23
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt prove;,23
Away at once with love or jealousy!,23
To show the love and duty that I bear you,23
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.,23
Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure:,23
Out of self-bounty be abused; look to't:,23
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks,23
Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown.,23
She did deceive her father marrying you;,23
She loved them most.,23
Why go to then;,23
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-,23
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon,23
I am bound to thee for ever.,23
Not a jot not a jot.,23
I hope you will consider what is spoke,23
I am to pray you not to strain my speech,23
Than to suspicion.,23
Should you do so my lord,23
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--,23
No not much moved:,23
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!,23
Ay there's the point: as--to be bold with you--,23
Of her own clime complexion and degree,23
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,23
But pardon me; I do not in position,23
Her will recoiling to her better judgment,23
And happily repent.,23
If more thou dost perceive let me know more;,23
[Going]  My lord I take my leave.,23
Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds.,23
your honour,23
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,23
Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,23
Note if your lady strain his entertainment,23
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,23
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--,23
Fear not my government.,23
Exit,23
And knows all qualities with a learned spirit,23
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,23
To pray at fortune. Haply for I am black,23
That chamberers have or for I am declined,23
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief,23
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,23
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,23
For others' uses. Yet 'tis the plague of great ones;,23
Tis destiny unshunnable like death:,23
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:,23
If she be false O then heaven mocks itself!,23
How now my dear Othello!,23
By you invited do attend your presence.,23
Why do you speak so faintly?,23
I have a pain upon my forehead here.,23
Let me but bind it hard within this hour,23
Your napkin is too little:,23
Let it alone. Come I'll go in with you.,23
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA,23
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:,23
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,23
That she reserves it evermore about her,23
And give't Iago: what he will do with it,23
I nothing but to please his fantasy.,23
How now! what do you here alone?,23
A thing for me? it is a common thing--,23
To have a foolish wife.,23
For the same handkerchief?,23
What handkerchief?,23
That which so often you did bid me steal.,23
No 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.,23
Look here it is.,23
What will you do with 't that you have been,23
To have me filch it?,23
If it be not for some purpose of import,23
When she shall lack it.,23
Go leave me.,23
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,23
Are to the jealous confirmations strong,23
The Moor already changes with my poison:,23
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,23
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:,23
Re-enter OTHELLO,23
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,23
Which thou owedst yesterday.,23
Why how now general! no more of that.,23
I swear 'tis better to be much abused,23
How now my lord!,23
I saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me:,23
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:,23
Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.,23
I had been happy if the general camp,23
So I had nothing known. O now for ever,23
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars,23
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,23
The royal banner and all quality,23
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats,23
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!,23
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore,23
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,23
Than answer my waked wrath!,23
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,23
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!,23
If thou dost slander her and torture me,23
On horror's head horrors accumulate;,23
For nothing canst thou to damnation add,23
O grace! O heaven forgive me!,23
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.,23
O monstrous world! Take note take note O world,23
I thank you for this profit; and from hence,23
Nay stay: thou shouldst be honest.,23
And loses that it works for.,23
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;,23
I'll have some proof. Her name that was as fresh,23
As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,23
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!,23
I do repent me that I put it to you.,23
Would! nay I will.,23
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on--,23
Death and damnation! O!,23
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,23
More than their own! What then? how then?,23
It is impossible you should see this,23
As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross,23
If imputation and strong circumstances,23
Will give you satisfaction you may have't.,23
I do not like the office:,23
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,23
And being troubled with a raging tooth,23
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,23
One of this kind is Cassio:,23
Let us be wary let us hide our loves;',23
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,23
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg,23
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!',23
Nay this was but his dream.,23
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream.,23
That do demonstrate thinly.,23
Nay but be wise: yet we see nothing done;,23
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief,23
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.,23
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day,23
If it be that--,23
It speaks against her with the other proofs.,23
One is too poor too weak for my revenge.,23
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.,23
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell!,23
To tyrannous hate! Swell bosom with thy fraught,23
Yet be content.,23
Patience I say; your mind perhaps may change.,23
Whose icy current and compulsive course,23
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,23
Shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love,23
Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,23
In the due reverence of a sacred vow,23
Do not rise yet.,23
Witness you ever-burning lights above,23
Witness that here Iago doth give up,23
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,23
What bloody business ever.,23
I greet thy love,23
And will upon the instant put thee to't:,23
That Cassio's not alive.,23
But let her live.,23
Come go with me apart; I will withdraw,23
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.,23
Exeunt,23
Enter DESDEMONA EMILIA and Clown,23
I dare not say he lies any where.,23
He's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies,23
Go to: where lodges he?,23
Can any thing be made of this?,23
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were,23
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?,23
questions and by them answer.,23
moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.,23
therefore I will attempt the doing it.,23
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia?,23
Believe me I had rather have lost my purse,23
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness,23
To put him to ill thinking.,23
Who he? I think the sun where he was born,23
Look where he comes.,23
Be call'd to him.,23
How is't with you my lord,23
Aside,23
How do you Desdemona?,23
Give me your hand: this hand is moist my lady.,23
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:,23
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer,23
For here's a young and sweating devil here,23
A frank one.,23
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.,23
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts.,23
What promise chuck?,23
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;,23
Here my lord.,23
I have it not about me.,23
No indeed my lord.,23
That handkerchief,23
She was a charmer and could almost read,23
she kept it,23
Entirely to her love but if she lost it,23
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt,23
And bid me when my fate would have me wive,23
Make it a darling like your precious eye;,23
As nothing else could match.,23
Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:,23
The sun to course two hundred compasses,23
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;,23
Conserved of maidens' hearts.,23
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.,23
Ha! wherefore?,23
Is't lost? is't gone? speak is it out,23
Heaven bless us!,23
It is not lost; but what an if it were?,23
I say it is not lost.,23
Why so I can sir but I will not now.,23
Pray you let Cassio be received again.,23
Come come;,23
The handkerchief!,23
The handkerchief!,23
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,23
The handkerchief!,23
Away!,23
Is not this man jealous?,23
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief:,23
Tis not a year or two shows us a man:,23
To eat us hungerly and when they are full,23
Enter CASSIO and IAGO,23
And lo the happiness! go and importune her.,23
Madam my former suit: I do beseech you,23
Exist and be a member of his love,23
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.,23
That nor my service past nor present sorrows,23
Can ransom me into his love again,23
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,23
To fortune's alms.,23
My advocation is not now in tune;,23
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.,23
As I have spoken for you all my best,23
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:,23
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.,23
He went hence but now,23
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,23
And like the devil from his very arm,23
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:,23
I prithee do so.,23
Something sure of state,23
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,23
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,23
For let our finger ache and it indues,23
Of pain: nay we must think men are not gods,23
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much Emilia,23
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;,23
And he's indicted falsely.,23
And no conception nor no jealous toy,23
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.,23
They are not ever jealous for the cause,23
Begot upon itself born on itself.,23
Lady amen.,23
If I do find him fit I'll move your suit,23
I humbly thank your ladyship.,23
Enter BIANCA,23
What make you from home?,23
I' faith sweet love I was coming to your house.,23
What keep a week away? seven days and nights?,23
More tedious than the dial eight score times?,23
Pardon me Bianca:,23
But I shall in a more continuate time,23
Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief,23
O Cassio whence came this?,23
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:,23
Go to woman!,23
From whence you have them. You are jealous now,23
No in good troth Bianca.,23
I know not sweet: I found it in my chamber.,23
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:,23
Leave you! wherefore?,23
And think it no addition nor my wish,23
Why I pray you?,23
But that you do not love me.,23
And say if I shall see you soon at night.,23
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.,23
Exeunt,23
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.,23
Will you think so?,23
What,23
An unauthorized kiss.,23
An hour or more not meaning any harm?,23
It is hypocrisy against the devil:,23
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.,23
But if I give my wife a handkerchief--,23
Why then 'tis hers my lord; and being hers,23
She is protectress of her honour too:,23
Her honour is an essence that's not seen;,23
But for the handkerchief--,23
Thou said'st it comes o'er my memory,23
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.,23
That's not so good now.,23
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?,23
Who having by their own importunate suit,23
Convinced or supplied them cannot choose,23
Hath he said any thing?,23
No more than he'll unswear.,23
Faith that he did--I know not what he did.,23
Lie--,23
With her on her; what you will.,23
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.,23
confess and be hanged for his labour;--first to be,23
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing,23
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses ears and lips.,23
Falls in a trance,23
My medicine work! Thus credulous fools are caught;,23
All guiltless meet reproach. What ho! my lord!,23
Enter CASSIO,23
What's the matter?,23
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.,23
No forbear;,23
If not he foams at mouth and by and by,23
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,23
I would on great occasion speak with you.,23
How is it general? have you not hurt your head?,23
I mock you! no by heaven.,23
A horned man's a monster and a beast.,23
And many a civil monster.,23
Good sir be a man;,23
May draw with you: there's millions now alive,23
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.,23
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,23
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be.,23
Stand you awhile apart;,23
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--,23
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,23
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;,23
And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns,23
For I will make him tell the tale anew,23
He hath and is again to cope your wife:,23
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,23
Dost thou hear Iago?,23
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.,23
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?,23
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,23
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature,23
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:,23
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:,23
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad;,23
Poor Cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior,23
The worser that you give me the addition,23
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure on't.,23
Now if this suit lay in Bianco's power,23
Alas poor caitiff!,23
I never knew woman love man so.,23
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.,23
Now he importunes him,23
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:,23
Ha ha ha!,23
I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee bear some,23
Ha ha ha!,23
Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her.,23
I am a very villain else.,23
This is the monkey's own giving out: she is,23
flattery not out of my promise.,23
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.,23
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,23
Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture,23
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales,23
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,23
throw it to.,23
Before me! look where she comes.,23
Enter BIANCA,23
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you,23
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the,23
it in your chamber and not know who left it there!,23
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever,23
How now my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!,23
An you'll come to supper to-night you may; an you,23
Exit,23
Faith I must; she'll rail in the street else.,23
Faith I intend so.,23
speak with you.,23
Go to; say no more.,23
[Advancing]  How shall I murder him Iago?,23
O Iago!,23
Was that mine?,23
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him and he,23
I would have him nine years a-killing.,23
Nay you must forget that.,23
for she shall not live: no my heart is turned to,23
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by,23
Nay that's not your way.,23
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she,23
and plenteous wit and invention:--,23
O a thousand thousand times: and then of so,23
Ay too gentle.,23
O Iago the pity of it Iago!,23
patent to offend; for if it touch not you it comes,23
I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!,23
With mine officer!,23
Get me some poison Iago; this night: I'll not,23
unprovide my mind again: this night Iago.,23
the bed she hath contaminated.,23
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker: you,23
Excellent good.,23
What trumpet is that same?,23
Come from the duke: and see your wife is with him.,23
Save you worthy general!,23
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.,23
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.,23
And what's the news good cousin Lodovico?,23
Welcome to Cyprus.,23
Lives sir.,23
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.,23
My lord?,23
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.,23
A most unhappy one: I would do much,23
Fire and brimstone!,23
Are you wise?,23
May be the letter moved him;,23
Deputing Cassio in his government.,23
Indeed!,23
I am glad to see you mad.,23
[Striking her]  Devil!,23
My lord this would not be believed in Venice,23
Make her amends; she weeps.,23
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,23
Out of my sight!,23
Going,23
I do beseech your lordship call her back.,23
My lord?,23
Who I my lord?,23
Sir she can turn and turn and yet go on,23
And she's obedient as you say obedient,23
Concerning this sir--O  well-painted passion!--,23
I'll send for you anon. Sir I obey the mandate,23
Exit DESDEMONA,23
I do entreat that we may sup together:,23
Exit,23
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature,23
The shot of accident nor dart of chance,23
He is much changed.,23
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure,23
I would to heaven he were!,23
Faith that was not so well; yet would I knew,23
Is it his use?,23
And new-create this fault?,23
It is not honesty in me to speak,23
And his own courses will denote him so,23
And mark how he continues.,23
Exeunt,23
Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA,23
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect.,23
But then I saw no harm and then I heard,23
What did they never whisper?,23
Nor send you out o' the way?,23
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing?,23
That's strange.,23
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,23
If any wretch have put this in your head,23
For if she be not honest chaste and true,23
Is foul as slander.,23
Exit EMILIA,23
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,23
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.,23
My lord what is your will?,23
What is your pleasure?,23
Look in my face.,23
[To EMILIA]  Some of your function mistress;,23
Cough or cry 'hem' if any body come:,23
Exit EMILIA,23
I understand a fury in your words.,23
Why what art thou?,23
And loyal wife.,23
Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves,23
Swear thou art honest.,23
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.,23
O Desdemona! away! away! away!,23
Am I the motive of these tears my lord?,23
An instrument of this your calling back,23
Why I have lost him too.,23
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd,23
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,23
I should have found in some place of my soul,23
A fixed figure for the time of scorn,23
Yet could I bear that too; well very well:,23
Where either I must live or bear no life;,23
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!,23
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,23
Ay there look grim as hell!,23
O ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,23
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet,23
ne'er been born!,23
Was this fair paper this most goodly book,23
Committed! O thou public commoner!,23
That would to cinders burn up modesty,23
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,23
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,23
Impudent strumpet!,23
Are you not a strumpet?,23
If to preserve this vessel for my lord,23
Be not to be a strumpet I am none.,23
No as I shall be saved.,23
O heaven forgive us!,23
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice,23
Raising his voice,23
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,23
Re-enter EMILIA,23
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:,23
Exit,23
How do you madam? how do you my good lady?,23
Good madam what's the matter with my lord?,23
Why with my lord madam.,23
He that is yours sweet lady.,23
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,23
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;,23
Here's a change indeed!,23
Tis meet I should be used so very meet.,23
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?,23
What is your pleasure madam?,23
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes,23
He might have chid me so; for in good faith,23
What's the matter lady?,23
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,23
Am I that name Iago?,23
Such as she says my lord did say I was.,23
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.,23
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.,23
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,23
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?,23
Beshrew him for't!,23
Nay heaven doth know.,23
Some busy and insinuating rogue,23
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.,23
If any such there be heaven pardon him!,23
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?,23
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,23
O heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold,23
To lash the rascals naked through the world,23
Speak within door.,23
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,23
You are a fool; go to.,23
What shall I do to win my lord again?,23
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:,23
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,23
Delighted them in any other form;,23
And ever will--though he do shake me off,23
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;,23
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:',23
To do the act that might the addition earn,23
I pray you be content; 'tis but his humour:,23
And he does chide with you.,23
Tis but so I warrant.,23
Hark how these instruments summon to supper!,23
Go in and weep not; all things shall be well.,23
Enter RODERIGO,23
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.,23
Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago;,23
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least,23
it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what,23
Will you hear me Roderigo?,23
performances are no kin together.,23
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of,23
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a,23
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden,23
Well; go to; very well.,23
not very well: nay I think it is scurvy and begin,23
Very well.,23
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my,23
unlawful solicitation; if not assure yourself I,23
You have said now.,23
Why now I see there's mettle in thee and even from,23
ever before. Give me thy hand Roderigo: thou hast,23
protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.,23
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your,23
Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I,23
purpose courage and valour this night show it: if,23
take me from this world with treachery and devise,23
Well what is it? is it within reason and compass?,23
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.,23
return again to Venice.,23
him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be,23
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.,23
Why by making him uncapable of Othello's place;,23
And that you would have me to do?,23
He sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will I,23
fortune. If you will watch his going thence which,23
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near,23
us. Come stand not amazed at it but go along with,23
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on,23
to waste: about it.,23
And you shall be satisfied.,23
SCENE III. Another room In the castle.,23
I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further.,23
Madam good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.,23
Will you walk sir?,23
My lord?,23
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.,23
Exeunt OTHELLO LODOVICO and Attendants,23
He says he will return incontinent:,23
And bade me to dismiss you.,23
It was his bidding: therefore good Emilia.,23
We must not now displease him.,23
So would not I my love doth so approve him,23
Prithee unpin me--have grace and favour in them.,23
All's one. Good faith how foolish are our minds!,23
In one of those same sheets.,23
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:,23
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;',23
And she died singing it: that song to-night,23
But to go hang my head all at one side,23
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?,23
This Lodovico is a proper man.,23
He speaks well.,23
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.,23
Sing all a green willow:,23
Sing willow willow willow:,23
Sing willow willow willow;,23
Lay by these:--,23
Sing willow willow willow;,23
Singing,23
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve-,23
It's the wind.,23
said he then?,23
If I court moe women you'll couch with moe men!,23
Doth that bode weeping?,23
I have heard it said so. O these men these men!,23
That there be women do abuse their husbands,23
There be some such no question.,23
Why would not you?,23
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;,23
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?,23
For a small vice.,23
In troth I think I should; and undo't when I had,23
joint-ring nor for measures of lawn nor for,23
exhibition; but for the whole world--why who would,23
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.,23
For the whole world.,23
having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your,23
I do not think there is any such woman.,23
store the world they played for.,23
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,23
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,23
Or scant our former having in despite;,23
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know,23
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,23
When they change us for others? Is it sport?,23
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?,23
Desires for sport and frailty as men have?,23
The ills we do their ills instruct us so.,23
Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend!,23
ACT V,23
Enter IAGO and RODERIGO,23
Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home:,23
It makes us or it mars us; think on that,23
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.,23
Retires,23
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:,23
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,23
Or Cassio him or each do kill the other,23
He calls me to a restitution large,23
As gifts to Desdemona;,23
He hath a daily beauty in his life,23
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:,23
Enter CASSIO,23
Makes a pass at CASSIO,23
But that my coat is better than thou know'st,23
Draws and wounds RODERIGO,23
IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg and exit,23
Falls,23
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.,23
It is even so.,23
Tis he:--O brave Iago honest and just,23
Thou teachest me. Minion your dear lies dead,23
Forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted;,23
Exit,23
What ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!,23
O help!,23
O wretched villain!,23
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe,23
Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.,23
Re-enter IAGO with a light,23
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?,23
Did not you hear a cry?,23
What's the matter?,23
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.,23
Iago? O I am spoil'd undone by villains!,23
O me lieutenant! what villains have done this?,23
And cannot make away.,23
What are you there? come in and give some help.,23
O help me here!,23
O murderous slave! O villain!,23
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!,23
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--,23
As you shall prove us praise us.,23
He sir.,23
Cassio!,23
My leg is cut in two.,23
Light gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.,23
What is the matter ho? who is't that cried?,23
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,23
O notable strumpet! Cassio may you suspect,23
No.,23
Lend me a garter. So. O for a chair,23
Alas he faints! O Cassio Cassio Cassio!,23
To be a party in this injury.,23
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?,23
Roderigo! no:--yes sure: O heaven! Roderigo.,23
Even he sir; did you know him?,23
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;,23
That so neglected you.,23
How do you Cassio? O a chair a chair!,23
He he 'tis he.,23
O that's well said; the chair!,23
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.,23
For you mistress,23
here Cassio,23
None in the world; nor do I know the man.,23
o' the air.,23
Stay you good gentlemen. Look you pale mistress?,23
Nay if you stare we shall hear more anon.,23
Do you see gentlemen? nay guiltiness will speak,23
Enter EMILIA,23
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark,23
He's almost slain and Roderigo dead.,23
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee Emilia,23
To BIANCA,23
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.,23
Fie fie upon thee strumpet!,23
As you that thus abuse me.,23
Kind gentlemen let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.,23
Emilia run you to the citadel,23
Will you go on? I pray.,23
This is the night,23
Exeunt,23
a light burning.,23
It is the cause it is the cause my soul--,23
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;,23
And smooth as monumental alabaster.,23
Put out the light and then put out the light:,23
I can again thy former light restore,23
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,23
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,23
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.,23
Ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade,23
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee,23
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,23
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.,23
Ay. Desdemona.,23
Have you pray'd to-night Desdemona?,23
If you bethink yourself of any crime,23
Solicit for it straight.,23
Well do it and be brief; I will walk by:,23
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.,23
Ay I do.,23
Have mercy on me!,23
If you say so I hope you will not kill me.,23
And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then,23
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.,23
They are loves I bear to you.,23
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.,23
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:,23
They do not point on me.,23
I will so. What's the matter?,23
Thou gavest to Cassio.,23
Send for the man and ask him.,23
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.,23
Yes presently:,23
For to deny each article with oath,23
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.,23
I say amen.,23
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio,23
As I might love: I never gave him token.,23
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,23
A murder which I thought a sacrifice:,23
He found it then;,23
Let him confess a truth.,23
What my lord?,23
How? unlawfully?,23
He will not say so.,23
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.,23
Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge,23
Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.,23
O banish me my lord but kill me not!,23
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!,23
But half an hour!,23
But while I say one prayer!,23
He stifles her,23
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?,23
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So so.,23
Who's there?,23
Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.,23
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?,23
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?,23
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.,23
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse,23
Should yawn at alteration.,23
That I may speak with you O good my lord!,23
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.,23
Unlocks the door,23
What's the matter with thee now?,23
What now?,23
It is the very error of the moon;,23
And makes men mad.,23
Call'd Roderigo.,23
And Cassio kill'd!,23
Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,23
O falsely falsely murder'd!,23
That! what?,23
Help! help ho! help! O lady speak again!,23
A guiltless death I die.,23
Nobody; I myself. Farewell,23
Dies,23
Alas who knows?,23
She said so: I must needs report the truth.,23
Twas I that kill'd her.,23
And you the blacker devil!,23
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil.,23
Thou art rash as fire to say,23
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.,23
But that I did proceed upon just grounds,23
My husband!,23
That she was false to wedlock?,23
If heaven would make me such another world,23
I'ld not have sold her for it.,23
Ay 'twas he that told me first:,23
That sticks on filthy deeds.,23
What needs this iteration woman? I say thy husband.,23
My husband say that she was false!,23
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?,23
If he say so may his pernicious soul,23
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.,23
Do thy worst:,23
Than thou wast worthy her.,23
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm,23
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--,23
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help ho! help!,23
Enter MONTANO GRATIANO IAGO and others,23
O are you come Iago? you have done well,23
What is the matter?,23
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:,23
Speak for my heart is full.,23
Than what he found himself was apt and true.,23
I did.,23
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie.,23
With Cassio mistress. Go to charm your tongue.,23
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed--,23
And your reports have set the murder on.,23
Tis a strange truth.,23
Villany villany villany!,23
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--,23
What are you mad? I charge you get you home.,23
Tis proper I obey him but not now.,23
O! O! O!,23
Nay lay thee down and roar;,23
That e'er did lift up eye.,23
I scarce did know you uncle: there lies your niece,23
I know this act shows horrible and grim.,23
Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief,23
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,23
And fall to reprobation.,23
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame,23
And she did gratify his amorous works,23
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:,23
My father gave my mother.,23
Come hold your peace.,23
No I will speak as liberal as the north:,23
All all cry shame against me yet I'll speak.,23
I will not.,23
Fie!,23
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of,23
For often with a solemn earnestness,23
He begg'd of me to steal it.,23
She give it Cassio! no alas! I found it,23
Filth thou liest!,23
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool,23
Are there no stones in heaven,23
He runs at IAGO  IAGO from behind stabs EMILIA and exit,23
Ay ay: O lay me by my mistress' side.,23
Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,23
Come guard the door without; let him not pass,23
For 'tis a damned slave.,23
I am not valiant neither,23
But why should honour outlive honesty?,23
What did thy song bode lady?,23
And die in music.,23
Willow willow willow--,23
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true;,23
Dies,23
It is a sword of Spain the ice-brook's temper:--,23
[Within]  If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear:,23
Look in upon me then and speak with me,23
Re-enter GRATIANO,23
Behold I have a weapon;,23
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,23
I have made my way through more impediments,23
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.,23
Here is my journey's end here is my butt,23
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;,23
And he retires. Where should Othello go?,23
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,23
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold cold my girl!,23
Whip me ye devils,23
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!,23
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!,23
Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO CASSIO carried in a chair and Officers with IAGO prisoner,23
That's he that was Othello: here I am.,23
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.,23
Wounds IAGO,23
I bleed sir; but not kill'd.,23
For in my sense 'tis happiness to die.,23
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,23
Why any thing:,23
For nought I did in hate but all in honour.,23
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?,23
Dear general I never gave you cause.,23
Will you I pray demand that demi-devil,23
Demand me nothing: what you know you know:,23
What not to pray?,23
Well thou dost best.,23
Which as I think you know not. Here is a letter,23
And here another: the one of them imports,23
By Roderigo.,23
Most heathenish and most gross!,23
Found in his pocket too; and this it seems,23
But that belike Iago in the interim,23
O the pernicious caitiff!,23
That was my wife's?,23
And he himself confess'd but even now,23
Which wrought to his desire.,23
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,23
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came,23
After long seeming dead Iago hurt him,23
You must forsake this room and go with us:,23
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,23
That can torment him much and hold him long,23
Till that the nature of your fault be known,23
Soft you; a word or two before you go.,23
No more of that. I pray you in your letters,23
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,23
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;,23
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,23
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,23
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees,23
And say besides that in Aleppo once,23
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,23
And smote him thus.,23
O bloody period!,23
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;,23
Falls on the bed and dies,23
For he was great of heart.,23
More fell than anguish hunger or the sea!,23
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;,23
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,23
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;,23
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state,23
Exeunt,23
PROLOGUE,24
Before the palace of Antioch,24
From ashes ancient Gower is come;,24
To glad your ear and please your eyes.,24
On ember-eves and holy-ales;,24
Have read it for restoratives:,24
Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius.,24
When wit's more ripe accept my rhymes.,24
May to your wishes pleasure bring,24
Waste it for you like taper-light.,24
Built up this city for his chiefest seat:,24
I tell you what mine authors say:,24
Who died and left a female heir,24
As heaven had lent her all his grace;,24
And her to incest did provoke:,24
To evil should be done by none:,24
Was with long use account no sin.,24
Made many princes thither frame,24
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:,24
To keep her still and men in awe,24
His riddle told not lost his life:,24
As yon grim looks do testify.,24
I give my cause who best can justify.,24
SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.,24
Young prince of Tyre you have at large received,24
I have Antiochus and with a soul,24
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.,24
For the embracements even of Jove himself;,24
Nature this dowry gave to glad her presence,24
To knit in her their best perfections.,24
See where she comes apparell'd like the spring,24
Of every virtue gives renown to men!,24
Nothing but curious pleasures as from thence,24
Could never be her mild companion.,24
That have inflamed desire in my breast,24
Or die in the adventure be my helps,24
To compass such a boundless happiness!,24
That would be son to great Antiochus.,24
With golden fruit but dangerous to be touch'd;,24
Her face like heaven enticeth thee to view,24
And which without desert because thine eye,24
Yon sometimes famous princes like thyself,24
Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale,24
Here they stand martyrs slain in Cupid's wars;,24
For going on death's net whom none resist.,24
My frail mortality to know itself,24
This body like to them to what I must;,24
Who tells us life's but breath to trust it error.,24
Who know the world see heaven but feeling woe,24
So I bequeath a happy peace to you,24
My riches to the earth from whence they came;,24
To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS,24
I wait the sharpest blow Antiochus.,24
Which read and not expounded 'tis decreed,24
Of all say'd yet mayst thou prove prosperous!,24
Like a bold champion I assume the lists,24
But faithfulness and courage.,24
I am no viper yet I feed,24
I sought a husband in which labour,24
He's father son and husband mild;,24
How they may be and yet in two,24
Sharp physic is the last: but O you powers,24
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,24
Fair glass of light I loved you and could still,24
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:,24
For he's no man on whom perfections wait,24
You are a fair viol and your sense the strings;,24
Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken:,24
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.,24
Prince Pericles touch not upon thy life.,24
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:,24
Great king,24
Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.,24
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:,24
Blows dust in other's eyes to spread itself;,24
The breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear:,24
Copp'd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng'd,24
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's,24
And if Jove stray who dares say Jove doth ill?,24
What being more known grows worse to smother it.,24
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.,24
the meaning:,24
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,24
We might proceed to cancel of your days;,24
As your fair self doth tune us otherwise:,24
If by which time our secret be undone,24
And until then your entertain shall be,24
Exeunt all but PERICLES,24
When what is done is like an hypocrite,24
If it be true that I interpret false,24
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;,24
By your untimely claspings with your child,24
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,24
And both like serpents are who though they feed,24
Antioch farewell! for wisdom sees those men,24
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.,24
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:,24
Ay and the targets to put off the shame:,24
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.,24
Re-enter ANTIOCHUS,24
To have his head.,24
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin,24
And therefore instantly this prince must die:,24
Who attends us there?,24
Doth your highness call?,24
You are of our chamber and our mind partakes,24
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.,24
We hate the prince of Tyre and thou must kill him:,24
Because we bid it. Say is it done?,24
Tis done.,24
Enter a Messenger,24
My lord prince Pericles is fled.,24
As thou,24
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark,24
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.',24
If I can get him within my pistol's length,24
Thaliard adieu!,24
Till Pericles be dead,24
Exit,24
Enter PERICLES,24
this change of thoughts,24
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,24
The tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet?,24
And danger which I fear'd is at Antioch,24
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,24
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,24
Have after-nourishment and life by care;,24
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.,24
Gainst whom I am too little to contend,24
Will think me speaking though I swear to silence;,24
If he suspect I may dishonour him:,24
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;,24
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,24
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,24
Which care of them not pity of myself,24
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,24
And punish that before that he would punish.,24
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!,24
Peaceful and comfortable!,24
They do abuse the king that flatter him:,24
The thing which is flatter'd but a spark,24
Whereas reproof obedient and in order,24
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,24
Prince pardon me or strike me if you please;,24
All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook,24
And then return to us.,24
Helicanus thou,24
An angry brow dread lord.,24
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?,24
They have their nourishment?,24
To take thy life from thee.,24
I have ground the axe myself;,24
Rise prithee rise.,24
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid,24
faults hid!,24
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,24
To bear with patience,24
Thou speak'st like a physician Helicanus,24
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.,24
Where as thou know'st against the face of death,24
From whence an issue I might propagate,24
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;,24
Which by my knowledge found the sinful father,24
know'st this,24
Such fear so grew in me I hither fled,24
Who seem'd my good protector; and being here,24
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears,24
And should he doubt it as no doubt he doth,24
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,24
To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,24
When all for mine if I may call offence,24
Which love to all of which thyself art one,24
Alas sir!,24
Musings into my mind with thousand doubts,24
And finding little comfort to relieve them,24
Well my lord since you have given me leave to speak.,24
And justly too I think you fear the tyrant,24
Will take away your life.,24
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,24
Your rule direct to any; if to me.,24
I do not doubt thy faith;,24
We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,24
Tyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsus,24
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.,24
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.,24
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:,24
That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,24
Exeunt,24
Enter THALIARD,24
kill King Pericles; and if I do it not I am sure to,24
he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that,24
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he,24
villain he's bound by the indenture of his oath to,24
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES with other Lords of Tyre,24
Further to question me of your king's departure:,24
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.,24
If further yet you will be satisfied,24
He would depart I'll give some light unto you.,24
[Aside]          What from Antioch?,24
Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:,24
To show his sorrow he'ld correct himself;,24
With whom each minute threatens life or death.,24
I shall not be hang'd now although I would;,24
He 'scaped the land to perish at the sea.,24
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.,24
With message unto princely Pericles;,24
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,24
We have no reason to desire it,24
Yet ere you shall depart this we desire,24
Exeunt,24
Enter CLEON the governor of Tarsus with DIONYZA and others,24
And by relating tales of others' griefs,24
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;,24
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.,24
Here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes,24
O Dionyza,24
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?,24
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,24
That if heaven slumber while their creatures want,24
I'll then discourse our woes felt several years,24
I'll do my best sir.,24
A city on whom plenty held full hand,24
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,24
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,24
Their tables were stored full to glad the sight,24
All poverty was scorn'd and pride so great,24
O 'tis too true.,24
These mouths who but of late earth sea and air,24
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,24
They are now starved for want of exercise:,24
Must have inventions to delight the taste,24
Those mothers who to nousle up their babes,24
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.,24
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:,24
Here many sink yet those which see them fall,24
Is not this true?,24
O let those cities that of plenty's cup,24
With their superfluous riots hear these tears!,24
Enter a Lord,24
Here.,24
For comfort is too far for us to expect.,24
A portly sail of ships make hitherward.,24
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,24
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,24
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,24
And make a conquest of unhappy me,24
That's the least fear; for by the semblance,24
And come to us as favourers not as foes.,24
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.,24
What need we fear?,24
Go tell their general we attend him here,24
And what he craves.,24
Exit,24
If wars we are unable to resist.,24
Lord governor for so we hear you are,24
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.,24
And seen the desolation of your streets:,24
But to relieve them of their heavy load;,24
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within,24
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,24
The gods of Greece protect you!,24
Arise I pray you rise:,24
And harbourage for ourself our ships and men.,24
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,24
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!,24
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.,24
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.,24
ACT II,24
Here have you seen a mighty king,24
A better prince and benign lord,24
Be quiet then as men should be,24
I'll show you those in troubles reign,24
The good in conversation,24
Is still at Tarsus where each man,24
And to remember what he does,24
But tidings to the contrary,24
DUMB SHOW.,24
Good Helicane that stay'd at home,24
From others' labours; for though he strive,24
And to fulfil his prince' desire,24
How Thaliard came full bent with sin,24
And that in Tarsus was not best,24
He doing so put forth to seas,24
For now the wind begins to blow;,24
Make such unquiet that the ship,24
And he good prince having all lost,24
All perishen of man of pelf,24
Till fortune tired with doing bad,24
And here he comes. What shall be next,24
Exit,24
Enter PERICLES wet,24
Wind rain and thunder remember earthly man,24
And I as fits my nature do obey you:,24
Wash'd me from shore to shore and left me breath,24
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers,24
And having thrown him from your watery grave,24
Enter three FISHERMEN,24
Ha come and bring away the nets!,24
What say you master?,24
fetch thee with a wanion.,24
were cast away before us even now.,24
pitiful cries they made to us to help them when,24
Nay master said not I as much when I saw the,24
they're half fish half flesh: a plague on them,24
marvel how the fishes live in the sea.,24
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to,24
tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at,24
have I heard on o' the land who never leave gaping,24
steeple bells and all.,24
But master if I had been the sexton I would have,24
Why man?,24
had been in his belly I would have kept such a,24
left till he cast bells steeple church and,24
were of my mind--,24
We would purge the land of these drones that rob,24
[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the sea,24
And from their watery empire recollect,24
Peace be at your labour honest fishermen.,24
fits you search out of the calendar and nobody,24
May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.,24

In that vast tennis-court have made the ball,24
He asks of you that never used to beg.,24
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do,24
Canst thou catch any fishes then?,24
Nay then thou wilt starve sure; for here's nothing,24
What I have been I have forgot to know;,24
A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,24
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;,24
For that I am a man pray see me buried.,24
come put it on; keep thee warm. Now afore me a,24
we'll have flesh for holidays fish for,24
and thou shalt be welcome.,24
Hark you my friend; you said you could not beg.,24
But crave! Then I'll turn craver too and so I,24
Why are all your beggars whipped then?,24
beggars were whipped I would wish no better office,24

[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!,24
Not well.,24
our king the good Simonides.,24
Ay sir; and he deserves so to be called for his,24
He is a happy king since he gains from his subjects,24
court distant from this shore?,24
you he hath a fair daughter and to-morrow is her,24
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.,24
to make one there.,24
cannot get he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.,24
Help master help! here's a fish hangs in the net,24
come out. Ha! bots on't 'tis come at last and,24
An armour friends! I pray you let me see it.,24
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;,24
Which my dead father did bequeath to me.,24
Keep it my Pericles; it hath been a shield,24
For that it saved me keep it; in like necessity--,24
defend thee.',24
Till the rough seas that spare not any man,24
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,24
What mean you sir?,24
For it was sometime target to a king;,24
And for his sake I wish the having of it;,24
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;,24
I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.,24
I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.,24
Ay but hark you my friend; 'twas we that made up,24
there are certain condolements certain vails. I,24
whence you had it.,24
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;,24
This jewel holds his building on my arm:,24
Upon a courser whose delightful steps,24
Only my friend I yet am unprovided,24
We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to,24
Then honour be but a goal to my will,24
Exeunt,24

Enter SIMONIDES THAISA Lords and Attendants,24
They are my liege;,24
Return them we are ready; and our daughter,24
Sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat,24
Exit a Lord,24
My commendations great whose merit's less.,24
A model which heaven makes like to itself:,24
So princes their renowns if not respected.,24
The labour of each knight in his device.,24
Enter a Knight; he passes over and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess,24
A knight of Sparta my renowned father;,24
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun,24
He loves you well that holds his life of you.,24
Who is the second that presents himself?,24
And the device he bears upon his shield,24
The motto thus in Spanish 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.',24
And what's the third?,24
And his device a wreath of chivalry;,24
The Fourth Knight passes over,24
A burning torch that's turned upside down;,24
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,24
The Fifth Knight passes over,24
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;,24
The Sixth Knight PERICLES passes over,24
The sixth and last the which the knight himself,24
He seems to be a stranger; but his present is,24
The motto 'In hac spe vivo.',24
From the dejected state wherein he is,24
He had need mean better than his outward show,24
For by his rusty outside he appears,24
He well may be a stranger for he comes,24
And on set purpose let his armour rust,24
Opinion's but a fool that makes us scan,24
But stay the knights are coming: we will withdraw,24
Exeunt,24
SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.,24
Knights,24
To place upon the volume of your deeds,24
Were more than you expect or more than's fit,24
Prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast:,24
But you my knight and guest;,24
And crown you king of this day's happiness.,24
Call it by what you will the day is yours;,24
In framing an artist art hath thus decreed,24
And you are her labour'd scholar. Come queen o',24
For daughter so you are--here take your place:,24
We are honour'd much by good Simonides.,24
For who hates honour hates the gods above.,24
Some other is more fit.,24
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes,24
You are right courteous knights.,24
By Jove I wonder that is king of thoughts,24
By Juno that is queen of marriage,24
Wishing him my meat. Sure he's a gallant gentleman.,24
Has done no more than other knights have done;,24
To me he seems like diamond to glass.,24
Which tells me in that glory once he was;,24
And he the sun for them to reverence;,24
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:,24
The which hath fire in darkness none in light:,24
He's both their parent and he is their grave,24
What are you merry knights?,24
Here with a cup that's stored unto the brim--,24
We drink this health to you.,24
Yet pause awhile:,24
As if the entertainment in our court,24
Note it not you Thaisa?,24
To me my father?,24
Princes in this should live like gods above,24
To honour them:,24
Which make a sound but kill'd are wonder'd at.,24
Here say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.,24
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:,24
Since men take women's gifts for impudence.,24
Do as I bid you or you'll move me else.,24
And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him,24
The king my father sir has drunk to you.,24
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.,24
And further he desires to know of you,24
A gentleman of Tyre; my name Pericles;,24
Who looking for adventures in the world,24
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.,24
A gentleman of Tyre,24
Bereft of ships and men cast on this shore.,24
And will awake him from his melancholy.,24
And waste the time which looks for other revels.,24
Will very well become a soldier's dance.,24
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,24
The Knights dance,24
Come sir;,24
And I have heard you knights of Tyre,24
And that their measures are as excellent.,24
O that's as much as you would be denied,24
The Knights and Ladies dance,24
Thanks gentlemen to all; all have done well.,24
But you the best. Pages and lights to conduct,24
To PERICLES,24
We have given order to be next our own.,24
Princes it is too late to talk of love;,24
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;,24
Exeunt,24
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES,24
Antiochus from incest lived not free:,24
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,24
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,24
Of an inestimable value and his daughter with him,24
Their bodies even to loathing; for they so stunk,24
Scorn now their hand should give them burial.,24
And yet but justice; for though,24
To bar heaven's shaft but sin had his reward.,24
Enter two or three Lords,24
Or council has respect with him but he.,24
And cursed be he that will not second it.,24
With me? and welcome: happy day my lords.,24
And now at length they overflow their banks.,24
Wrong not yourself then noble Helicane;,24
Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.,24
If in his grave he rest we'll find him there;,24
Or dead give's cause to mourn his funeral,24
Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:,24
Like goodly buildings left without a roof,24
That best know how to rule and how to reign,24
Live noble Helicane!,24
If that you love Prince Pericles forbear.,24
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.,24
Forbear the absence of your king:,24
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.,24
Go search like nobles like noble subjects,24
Whom if you find and win unto return,24
To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;,24
We with our travels will endeavour us.,24
When peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands.,24
SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.,24
Good morrow to the good Simonides.,24
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake,24
Her reason to herself is only known,24
May we not get access to her my lord?,24
Her to her chamber that 'tis impossible.,24
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd,24
Loath to bid farewell we take our leaves.,24
So,24
She tells me here she'd wed the stranger knight,24
Tis well mistress; your choice agrees with mine;,24
Not minding whether I dislike or no!,24
And will no longer have it be delay'd.,24
Enter PERICLES,24
To you as much sir! I am beholding to you,24
Protest my ears were never better fed,24
It is your grace's pleasure to commend;,24
Sir you are music's master.,24
Let me ask you one thing:,24
A most virtuous princess.,24
As a fair day in summer wondrous fair.,24
Ay so well that you must be her master,24
I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.,24
[Aside]  What's here?,24
Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.,24
A stranger and distressed gentleman,24
But bent all offices to honour her.,24
A villain.,24
Never did thought of mine levy offence;,24
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.,24
Traitor!,24
Even in his throat--unless it be the king--,24
[Aside]  Now by the gods I do applaud his courage.,24
That never relish'd of a base descent.,24
And not to be a rebel to her state;,24
This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.,24
Here comes my daughter she can witness it.,24
Then as you are as virtuous as fair,24
Did ere solicit or my hand subscribe,24
Why sir say if you had,24
Yea mistress are you so peremptory?,24
I am glad on't with all my heart.--,24
Will you not having my consent,24
Upon a stranger?,24
who for aught I know,24
As great in blood as I myself.--,24
Your will to mine--and you sir hear you,24
Man and wife:,24
And being join'd I'll thus your hopes destroy;,24
What are you both pleased?,24
Even as my life or blood that fosters it.,24
Yes if it please your majesty.,24
And then with what haste you can get you to bed.,24
ACT III,24
Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;,24
Made louder by the o'er-fed breast,24
The cat with eyne of burning coal,24
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,24
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.,24
A babe is moulded. Be attent,24
With your fine fancies quaintly eche:,24
DUMB SHOW.,24
By many a dern and painful perch,24
By the four opposing coigns,24
Is made with all due diligence,24
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,24
To the court of King Simonides,24
Antiochus and his daughter dead;,24
Of Helicanus would set on,24
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;,24
Come not home in twice six moons,24
Will take the crown. The sum of this,24
Y-ravished the regions round,24
Our heir-apparent is a king!,24
Brief he must hence depart to Tyre:,24
Which who shall cross?--along to go:,24
Lychorida her nurse she takes,24
On Neptune's billow; half the flood,24
Varies again; the grisly north,24
That as a duck for life that dives,24
The lady shrieks and well-a-near,24
And what ensues in this fell storm,24
I nill relate action may,24
Which might not what by me is told.,24
This stage the ship upon whose deck,24
Exit,24
Enter PERICLES on shipboard,24
Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou that hast,24
Having call'd them from the deep! O still,24
Thy nimble sulphurous flashes! O how Lychorida,24
Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle,24
Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina O,24
To those that cry by night convey thy deity,24
Of my queen's travails!,24
Now Lychorida!,24
Who if it had conceit would die as I,24
Of your dead queen.,24
Patience good sir; do not assist the storm.,24
A little daughter: for the sake of it,24
O you gods!,24
And snatch them straight away? We here below,24
Use honour with you.,24
Even for this charge.,24
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:,24
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world,24
Thou hast as chiding a nativity,24
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first,24
With all thou canst find here. Now the good gods,24
Enter two Sailors,24
Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;,24
Of this poor infant this fresh-new sea-farer,24
Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not wilt thou?,24
But sea-room an the brine and cloudy billow kiss,24
Sir your queen must overboard: the sea works high,24
cleared of the dead.,24
Pardon us sir; with us at sea it hath been still,24
briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.,24
Here she lies sir.,24
No light no fire: the unfriendly elements,24
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave but straight,24
Where for a monument upon thy bones,24
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,24
Bid Nestor bring me spices ink and paper,24
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe,24
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly woman.,24
Sir we have a chest beneath the hatches caulked,24
I thank thee. Mariner say what coast is this?,24
Thither gentle mariner.,24
By break of day if the wind cease.,24
There will I visit Cleon for the babe,24
At careful nursing. Go thy ways good mariner:,24
Exeunt,24
Enter CERIMON with a Servant and some Persons who have been shipwrecked,24
Enter PHILEMON,24
Get fire and meat for these poor men:,24
I have been in many; but such a night as this,24
Your master will be dead ere you return;,24
That can recover him.,24
Give this to the 'pothecary,24
Exeunt all but CERIMON,24
Good morrow.,24
Gentlemen,24
Sir,24
Shook as the earth did quake;,24
And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear,24
That is the cause we trouble you so early;,24
O you say well.,24
Rich tire about you should at these early hours,24
Tis most strange,24
Being thereto not compell'd.,24
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater,24
May the two latter darken and expend;,24
Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever,24
By turning o'er authorities I have,24
To me and to my aid the blest infusions,24
And I can speak of the disturbances,24
A more content in course of true delight,24
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,24
Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth,24
Your creatures who by you have been restored:,24
Your purse still open hath built Lord Cerimon,24
Enter two or three Servants with a chest,24
What is that?,24
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:,24
Set 't down let's look upon't.,24
Whate'er it be,24
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,24
Tis so my lord.,24
Did the sea cast it up?,24
As toss'd it upon shore.,24
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.,24
As ever hit my nostril. So up with it.,24
Most strange!,24
With full bags of spices! A passport too!,24
Reads from a scroll,24
If e'er this coffin drive a-land,24
This queen worth all our mundane cost.,24
She was the daughter of a king:,24
The gods requite his charity!',24
That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.,24
Nay certainly to-night;,24
That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:,24
Exit a Servant,24
And yet the fire of life kindle again,24
That had nine hours lien dead,24
Re-enter a Servant with boxes napkins and fire,24
The rough and woeful music that we have,24
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st thou block!,24
Gentlemen.,24
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced,24
Into life's flower again!,24
Through you increase our wonder and set up,24
She is alive; behold,24
Which Pericles hath lost,24
The diamonds of a most praised water,24
And make us weep to hear your fate fair creature,24
She moves,24
Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?,24
Most rare.,24
Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.,24
For her relapse is mortal. Come come;,24
Exeunt carrying her away,24
Enter PERICLES CLEON DIONYZA and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her arms,24
My twelve months are expired and Tyrus stands,24
Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods,24
Your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally,24
O your sweet queen!,24
To have bless'd mine eyes with her!,24
The powers above us. Could I rage and roar,24
Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina whom,24
I charge your charity withal leaving her,24
To give her princely training that she may be,24
Fear not my lord but think,24
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,24
Should therein make me vile the common body,24
But if to that my nature need a spur,24
To the end of generation!,24
Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,24
By bright Diana whom we honour all,24
Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.,24
In bringing up my child.,24
Who shall not be more dear to my respect,24
Madam my thanks and prayers.,24
Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and,24
I will embrace,24
Lychorida no tears:,24
You may depend hereafter. Come my lord.,24
SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.,24
Madam this letter and some certain jewels,24
At your command. Know you the character?,24
That I was shipp'd at sea I well remember,24
Deliver'd by the holy gods,24
My wedded lord I ne'er shall see again,24
And never more have joy.,24
Diana's temple is not distant far,24
Moreover if you please a niece of mine,24
My recompense is thanks that's all;,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER,24
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.,24
Unto Diana there a votaress.,24
Whom our fast-growing scene must find,24
In music letters; who hath gain'd,24
Which makes her both the heart and place,24
That monster envy oft the wrack,24
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.,24
One daughter and a wench full grown,24
Hight Philoten: and it is said,24
Would ever with Marina be:,24
With fingers long small white as milk;,24
The cambric which she made more sound,24
She sung and made the night-bird mute,24
She would with rich and constant pen,24
This Philoten contends in skill,24
With the dove of Paphos might the crow,24
All praises which are paid as debts,24
In Philoten all graceful marks,24
A present murderer does prepare,24
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.,24
Lychorida our nurse is dead:,24
The pregnant instrument of wrath,24
I do commend to your content:,24
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;,24
Unless your thoughts went on my way.,24
With Leonine a murderer.,24
SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.,24
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:,24
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,24
Which is but cold inflaming love i' thy bosom,24
Even women have cast off melt thee but be,24
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.,24
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.,24
I am resolved.,24
No I will rob Tellus of her weed,24
The purple violets and marigolds,24
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,24
This world to me is like a lasting storm,24
How now Marina! why do you keep alone?,24
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have,24
With this unprofitable woe!,24
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,24
Leonine take her by the arm walk with her.,24
I'll not bereave you of your servant.,24
I love the king your father and yourself,24
Expect him here: when he shall come and find,24
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;,24
No care to your best courses. Go I pray you,24
That excellent complexion which did steal,24
I can go home alone.,24
But yet I have no desire to it.,24
Walk half an hour Leonine at the least:,24
I warrant you madam.,24
Pray walk softly do not heat your blood:,24
My thanks sweet madam.,24
Is this wind westerly that blows?,24
When I was born the wind was north.,24
My father as nurse said did never fear,24
His kingly hands haling ropes;,24
That almost burst the deck.,24
When I was born:,24
And from the ladder-tackle washes off,24
And with a dropping industry they skip,24
The master calls and trebles their confusion.,24
What mean you?,24
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,24
To do my work with haste.,24
To satisfy my lady.,24
Now as I can remember by my troth,24
I never spake bad word nor did ill turn,24
I never kill'd a mouse nor hurt a fly:,24
But I wept for it. How have I offended,24
Or my life imply her any danger?,24
Is not to reason of the deed but do it.,24
You are well favour'd and your looks foreshow,24
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:,24
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,24
I am sworn,24
He seizes her,24
Hold villain!,24
A prize! a prize!,24
Come let's have her aboard suddenly.,24
Re-enter LEONINE,24
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:,24
she's dead,24
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,24
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.,24
SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.,24
Boult!,24
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of,24
too wenchless.,24
poor three and they can do no more than they can,24
Therefore let's have fresh ones whate'er we pay for,24
every trade we shall never prosper.,24
bastards--as I think I have brought up some eleven--,24
shall I search the market?,24
will blow it to pieces they are so pitifully sodden.,24
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead that,24
Ay she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat,24
Exit,24
proportion to live quietly and so give over.,24
when we are old?,24
the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,24
estate 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.,24
will be strong with us for giving over.,24
As well as we! ay and better too; we offend worse.,24
calling. But here comes Boult.,24
[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters you say,24
O sir we doubt it not.,24
if you like her so; if not I have lost my earnest.,24
She has a good face speaks well and has excellent,24
qualities can make her be refused.,24
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.,24
money presently. Wife take her in; instruct her,24
entertainment.,24
Boult take you the marks of her the colour of her,24
virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall,24
thing if men were as they have been. Get this done,24
Performance shall follow.,24
Alack that Leonine was so slack so slow!,24
Not enough barbarous had not o'erboard thrown me,24
Why lament you pretty one?,24
Come the gods have done their part in you.,24
You are light into my hands where you are like to live.,24
To scape his hands where I was like to die.,24
No.,24
fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the,24
Are you a woman?,24
An honest woman or not a woman.,24
something to do with you. Come you're a young,24
you.,24
If it please the gods to defend you by men then men,24
you up. Boult's returned.,24
Now sir hast thou cried her through the market?,24
I have drawn her picture with my voice.,24
inclination of the people especially of the younger sort?,24
hearkened to their father's testament. There was a,24
her very description.,24
To-night to-night. But mistress do you know the,24
Who Monsieur Veroles?,24
proclamation; but he made a groan at it and swore,24
Well well; as for him he brought his disease,24
come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the,24
Well if we had of every nation a traveller we,24
[To MARINA]  Pray you come hither awhile. You,24
seem to do that fearfully which you commit,24
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your,24
opinion and that opinion a mere profit.,24
O take her home mistress take her home: these,24
Thou sayest true i' faith so they must; for your,24
with warrant.,24
I have bargained for the joint--,24
I may so.,24
manner of your garments well.,24
Boult spend thou that in the town: report what a,24
When nature flamed this piece she meant thee a good,24
hast the harvest out of thine own report.,24
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up,24
Come your ways; follow me.,24
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.,24
What have we to do with Diana? Pray you will you go with us?,24
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.,24
Why are you foolish? Can it be undone?,24
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!,24
You'll turn a child again.,24
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,24
To equal any single crown o' the earth,24
Whom thou hast poison'd too:,24
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say,24
That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,24
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?,24
And for an honest attribute cry out,24
O go to. Well well,24
Do like this worst.,24
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,24
To think of what a noble strain you are,24
To such proceeding,24
Though not his prime consent he did not flow,24
Be it so then:,24
Nor none can know Leonine being gone.,24
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,24
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin,24
And though you call my course unnatural,24
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness,24
Heavens forgive it!,24
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,24
Is almost finish'd and her epitaphs,24
A general praise to her and care in us,24
Thou art like the harpy,24
Seize with thine eagle's talons.,24
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus,24
Sail seas in cockles have an wish but for't;,24
From bourn to bourn region to region.,24
To use one language in each several clime,24
To learn of me who stand i' the gaps to teach you,24
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,24
To see his daughter all his life's delight.,24
Advanced in time to great and high estate,24
Old Helicanus goes along behind.,24
This king to Tarsus--think his pilot thought;,24
To fetch his daughter home who first is gone.,24
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.,24
Enter PERICLES at one door with all his train;  CLEON and DIONYZA at the other. CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA,24
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;,24
With sighs shot through and biggest tears,24
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears,24
He puts on sackcloth and to sea. He bears,24
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.,24
By wicked Dionyza.,24
The fairest sweet'st and best lies here,24
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,24
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,24
Therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd,24
Wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint,24
No visor does become black villany,24
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,24
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play,24
In her unholy service. Patience then,24
Exit,24
Enter from the brothel two Gentlemen,24
No nor never shall do in such a place as this she,24
But to have divinity preached there! did you ever,24
No no. Come I am for no more bawdy-houses:,24
I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I,24
Exeunt,24
Enter Pandar Bawd and BOULT,24
had ne'er come here.,24
Priapus and undo a whole generation. We must,24
should do for clients her fitment and do me the,24
her reasons her master reasons her prayers her,24
if he should cheapen a kiss of her.,24
of all our cavaliers and make our swearers priests.,24
Faith there's no way to be rid on't but by the,24
We should have both lord and lown if the peevish,24
Enter LYSIMACHUS,24
Now the gods to-bless your honour!,24
You may so; 'tis the better for you that your,24
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal,24
We have here one sir if she would--but there never,24
If she'ld do the deed of darkness thou wouldst say.,24
Well call forth call forth.,24
see a rose; and she were a rose indeed if she had but--,24
O sir I can be modest.,24
gives a good report to a number to be chaste.,24
Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never,24
Re-enter BOULT with MARINA,24
Faith she would serve after a long voyage at sea.,24
I beseech your honour give me leave: a word and,24
I beseech you do.,24
an honourable man.,24
Next he's the governor of this country and a man,24
If he govern the country you are bound to him,24
Pray you without any more virginal fencing will,24
What he will do graciously I will thankfully receive.,24
My lord she's not paced yet: you must take some,24
leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.,24
Now pretty one how long have you been at this trade?,24
Why I cannot name't but I shall offend.,24
How long have you been of this profession?,24
Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at,24
Earlier too sir if now I be one.,24
creature of sale.,24
and will come into 't? I hear say you are of,24
Why hath your principal made known unto you who I am?,24
Why your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots,24
of my power and so stand aloof for more serious,24
authority shall not see thee or else look friendly,24
come come.,24
If put upon you make the judgment good,24
How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.,24
That am a maid though most ungentle fortune,24
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,24
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,24
That flies i' the purer air!,24
Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.,24
Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold here's gold for thee:,24
And the gods strengthen thee!,24
For me be you thoughten,24
The very doors and windows savour vilely.,24
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.,24
A curse upon him die he like a thief,24
Hear from me it shall be for thy good.,24
I beseech your honour one piece for me.,24
Your house but for this virgin that doth prop it,24
Exit,24
If your peevish chastity which is not worth a,24
shall undo a whole household let me be gelded like,24
Whither would you have me?,24
hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll,24
Re-enter Bawd,24
Worse and worse mistress; she has here spoken holy,24
O abominable!,24
the face of the gods.,24
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a,24
snowball; saying his prayers too.,24
crack the glass of her virginity and make the rest malleable.,24
is she shall be ploughed.,24
She conjures: away with her! Would she had never,24
to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?,24
Exit,24
Whither wilt thou have me?,24
Prithee tell me one thing first.,24
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?,24
Neither of these are so bad as thou art,24
Thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend,24
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every,24
To the choleric fisting of every rogue,24
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.,24
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss,24
buy him a wooden one?,24
OLD receptacles or common shores of filth;,24
Any of these ways are yet better than this;,24
Would own a name too dear. O that the gods,24
Here here's gold for thee.,24
Proclaim that I can sing weave sew and dance,24
And I will undertake all these to teach.,24
Yield many scholars.,24
Prove that I cannot take me home again,24
That doth frequent your house.,24
place thee I will.,24
Faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them.,24
there's no going but by their consent: therefore I,24
doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.,24
Exeunt,24
Enter GOWER,24
Into an honest house our story says.,24
As goddess-like to her admired lays;,24
Nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry,24
Her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry:,24
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain,24
And to her father turn our thoughts again,24
Whence driven before the winds he is arrived,24
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived,24
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,24
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.,24
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:,24
Shall be discover'd; please you sit and hark.,24
SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship off Mytilene. A close,24
within it reclined on a couch. A barge lying,24
Enter two Sailors one belonging to the Tyrian vessel the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS,24
he can resolve you.,24
Sir there's a barge put off from Mytilene,24
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?,24
Ho gentlemen! my lord calls.,24
Doth your lordship call?,24
I pray ye greet them fairly.,24
Enter from thence LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors,24
This is the man that can in aught you would,24
Hail reverend sir! the gods preserve you!,24
And die as I would do.,24
Being on shore honouring of Neptune's triumphs,24
I made to it to know of whence you are.,24
I am the governor of this place you lie before.,24
Our vessel is of Tyre in it the king;,24
To any one nor taken sustenance,24
Upon what ground is his distemperature?,24
But the main grief springs from the loss,24
May we not see him?,24
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.,24
Behold him.,24
This was a goodly person,24
Drove him to this.,24
Hail royal sir!,24
Sir,24
Would win some words of him.,24
She questionless with her sweet harmony,24
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,24
She is all happy as the fairest of all,24
The leafy shelter that abuts against,24
Whispers a Lord who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS,24
That bears recovery's name. But since your kindness,24
That for our gold we may provision have,24
But weary for the staleness.,24
Which if we should deny the most just gods,24
And so afflict our province. Yet once more,24
Of your king's sorrow.,24
But see I am prevented.,24
O here is,24
Is't not a goodly presence?,24
She's such a one that were I well assured,24
I'ld wish no better choice and think me rarely wed.,24
Expect even here where is a kingly patient:,24
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,24
As thy desires can wish.,24
My utmost skill in his recovery Provided,24
Be suffer'd to come near him.,24
And the gods make her prosperous!,24
Mark'd he your music?,24
See she will speak to him.,24
Hum ha!,24
My lord that ne'er before invited eyes,24
My lord that may be hath endured a grief,24
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,24
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:,24
And to the world and awkward casualties,24
Aside,24
But there is something glows upon my cheek,24
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--,24
I said my lord if you did know my parentage,24
I do think so. Pray you turn your eyes upon me.,24
Here of these shores?,24
Yet I was mortally brought forth and am,24
I am great with woe and shall deliver weeping.,24
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;,24
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like,24
Who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry,24
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck,24
Where were you bred?,24
You make more rich to owe?,24
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.,24
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st,24
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will,24
And make my senses credit thy relation,24
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?,24
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest,24
So indeed I did.,24
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,24
If both were open'd.,24
I said and said no more but what my thoughts,24
Tell thy story;,24
Of my endurance thou art a man and I,24
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves and smiling,24
How lost thou them? Thy name my most kind virgin?,24
My name is Marina.,24
And thou by some incensed god sent hither,24
Patience good sir,24
Nay I'll be patient.,24
To call thyself Marina.,24
Was given me by one that had some power,24
How! a king's daughter?,24
You said you would believe me;,24
I will end here.,24
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?,24
And wherefore call'd Marina?,24
For I was born at sea.,24
My mother was the daughter of a king;,24
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft,24
O stop there a little!,24
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep,24
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?,24
And never interrupt you.,24
I will believe you by the syllable,24
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?,24
Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife,24
A villain to attempt it who having drawn to do't,24
Brought me to Mytilene. But good sir,24
It may be,24
I am the daughter to King Pericles,24
Ho Helicanus!,24
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,24
What this maid is or what is like to be,24
I know not; but,24
Speaks nobly of her.,24
Her parentage; being demanded that,24
O Helicanus strike me honour'd sir;,24
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me,24
And drown me with their sweetness. O come hither,24
Thou that wast born at sea buried at Tarsus,24
Down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud,24
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,24
Though doubts did ever sleep.,24
What is your title?,24
My drown'd queen's name as in the rest you said,24
The heir of kingdoms and another like,24
Is it no more to be your daughter than,24
Thaisa was my mother who did end,24
Now blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.,24
She is not dead at Tarsus as she should have been,24
When thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge,24
Sir 'tis the governor of Mytilene,24
Did come to see you.,24
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.,24
Tell Helicanus my Marina tell him,24
How sure you are my daughter. But what music?,24
None!,24
It is not good to cross him; give him way.,24
My lord I hear.,24
Most heavenly music!,24
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.,24
A pillow for his head:,24
If this but answer to my just belief,24
Exeunt all but PERICLES,24
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,24
There when my maiden priests are met together,24
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:,24
And give them repetition to the life.,24
Do it and happy; by my silver bow!,24
Disappears,24
I will obey thee. Helicanus!,24
Sir?,24
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am,24
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.,24
Shall we refresh us sir upon your shore,24
As our intents will need?,24
With all my heart; and when you come ashore,24
You shall prevail,24
You have been noble towards her.,24
Come my Marina.,24
SCENE II:,24
Now our sands are almost run;,24
This my last boon give me,24
That you aptly will suppose,24
What minstrelsy and pretty din,24
To greet the king. So he thrived,24
To fair Marina; but in no wise,24
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,24
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,24
At Ephesus the temple see,24
That he can hither come so soon,24
Exit,24
near the altar as high priestess; a number of,24
of Ephesus attending.,24
Hail Dian! to perform thy just command,24
Who frighted from my country did wed,24
At sea in childbed died she but brought forth,24
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus,24
He sought to murder: but her better stars,24
Riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,24
Made known herself my daughter.,24
You are you are--O royal Pericles!,24
What means the nun? she dies! help gentlemen!,24
If you have told Diana's altar true,24
Reverend appearer no;,24
Upon this coast I warrant you.,24
Look to the lady; O she's but o'erjoy'd.,24
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,24
Here in Diana's temple.,24
Great sir they shall be brought you to my house,24
O let me look!,24
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,24
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,24
A birth and death?,24
That Thaisa am I supposed dead,24
Immortal Dian!,24
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,24
Shows a ring,24
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,24
Melt and no more be seen. O come be buried,24
My heart,24
Kneels to THAISA,24
Thy burden at the sea and call'd Marina,24
Blest and mine own!,24
I know you not.,24
I left behind an ancient substitute:,24
I have named him oft.,24
Still confirmation:,24
Now do I long to hear how you were found;,24
Besides the gods for this great miracle.,24
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can,24
Reverend sir,24
More like a god than you. Will you deliver,24
I will my lord.,24
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;,24
No needful thing omitted.,24
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,24
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,24
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;,24
To grace thy marriage-day I'll beautify.,24
My father's dead.,24
We'll celebrate their nuptials and ourselves,24
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.,24
To hear the rest untold: sir lead's the way.,24
Enter GOWER,24
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:,24
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,24
Led on by heaven and crown'd with joy at last:,24
A figure of truth of faith of loyalty:,24
The worth that learned charity aye wears:,24
Had spread their cursed deed and honour'd name,24
That him and his they in his palace burn;,24
To punish them; although not done but meant.,24
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.,24
ACT I,25
Enter KING RICHARD II JOHN OF GAUNT with other Nobles and Attendants,25
Hast thou according to thy oath and band,25
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,25
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray?,25
Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him,25
Or worthily as a good subject should,25
As near as I could sift him on that argument,25
Aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice.,25
And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear,25
High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire,25
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY,25
My gracious sovereign my most loving liege!,25
Until the heavens envying earth's good hap,25
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,25
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.,25
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray?,25
In the devotion of a subject's love,25
And free from other misbegotten hate,25
Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee,25
My body shall make good upon this earth,25
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,25
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,25
Once more the more to aggravate the note,25
And wish so please my sovereign ere I move,25
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:,25
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,25
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:,25
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:,25
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;,25
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.,25
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,25
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:,25
And meet him were I tied to run afoot,25
Or any other ground inhabitable,25
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,25
Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage,25
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,25
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength,25
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,25
What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise.,25
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,25
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:,25
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!,25
It must be great that can inherit us,25
Look what I speak my life shall prove it true;,25
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,25
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.,25
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge,25
That all the treasons for these eighteen years,25
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.,25
Upon his bad life to make all this good,25
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,25
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:,25
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,25
And by the glorious worth of my descent,25
How high a pitch his resolution soars!,25
O let my sovereign turn away his face,25
Till I have told this slander of his blood,25
Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears:,25
As he is but my father's brother's son,25
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood,25
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:,25
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.,25
Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.,25
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;,25
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,25
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:,25
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace,25
For you my noble Lord of Lancaster,25
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,25
But ere I last received the sacrament,25
Your grace's pardon and I hope I had it.,25
It issues from the rancour of a villain,25
Which in myself I boldly will defend;,25
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,25
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.,25
Your highness to assign our trial day.,25
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:,25
Deep malice makes too deep incision;,25
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.,25
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son.,25
Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolk's gage.,25
When Harry when?,25
Norfolk throw down we bid; there is no boot.,25
My life thou shalt command but not my shame:,25
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,25
I am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here,25
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood,25
Rage must be withstood:,25
Yea but not change his spots: take but my shame.,25
The purest treasure mortal times afford,25
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.,25
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.,25
Take honour from me and my life is done:,25
In that I live and for that will I die.,25
O God defend my soul from such deep sin!,25
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height,25
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,25
The slavish motive of recanting fear,25
Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbray's face.,25
We were not born to sue but to command;,25
Be ready as your lives shall answer it,25
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate,25
Since we can not atone you we shall see,25
Lord marshal command our officers at arms,25
Exeunt,25
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS,25
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,25
But since correction lieth in those hands,25
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;,25
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.,25
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?,25
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,25
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,25
But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester,25
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,25
Is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded,25
Ah Gaunt his blood was thine! that bed that womb,25
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,25
In some large measure to thy father's death,25
Who was the model of thy father's life.,25
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,25
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:,25
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.,25
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.,25
His deputy anointed in His sight,25
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift,25
Where then alas may I complain myself?,25
Why then I will. Farewell old Gaunt.,25
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:,25
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!,25
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,25
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,25
Farewell old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife,25
Sister farewell; I must to Coventry:,25
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,25
I take my leave before I have begun,25
Commend me to thy brother Edmund York.,25
Though this be all do not so quickly go;,25
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.,25
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,25
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?,25
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.,25
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.,25
SCENE III. The lists at Coventry.,25
My Lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford arm'd?,25
The Duke of Norfolk sprightfully and bold,25
Why then the champions are prepared and stay,25
The trumpets sound and KING RICHARD enters with  his nobles JOHN OF GAUNT BUSHY BAGOT GREEN and  others. When they are set enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in arms defendant with a Herald,25
The cause of his arrival here in arms:,25
To swear him in the justice of his cause.,25
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,25
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;,25
My name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk;,25
Which God defend a knight should violate!--,25
To God my king and my succeeding issue,25
And by the grace of God and this mine arm,25
A traitor to my God my king and me:,25
The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE appellant in armour with a Herald,25
Both who he is and why he cometh hither,25
And formally according to our law,25
What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,25
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?,25
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby,25
To prove by God's grace and my body's valour,25
That he is a traitor foul and dangerous,25
And as I truly fight defend me heaven!,25
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,25
Appointed to direct these fair designs.,25
And bow my knee before his majesty:,25
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;,25
And loving farewell of our several friends.,25
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.,25
Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right,25
Farewell my blood; which if to-day thou shed,25
O let no noble eye profane a tear,25
As confident as is the falcon's flight,25
My loving lord I take my leave of you;,25
Not sick although I have to do with death,25
Lo as at English feasts so I regreet,25
O thou the earthly author of my blood,25
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up,25
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;,25
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,25
Even in the lusty havior of his son.,25
Be swift like lightning in the execution;,25
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque,25
Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live.,25
However God or fortune cast my lot,25
A loyal just and upright gentleman:,25
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace,25
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate,25
Most mighty liege and my companion peers,25
As gentle and as jocund as to jest,25
Farewell my lord: securely I espy,25
Order the trial marshal and begin.,25
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!,25
Go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk.,25
Stands here for God his sovereign and himself,25
To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray,25
And dares him to set forward to the fight.,25
On pain to be found false and recreant,25
Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby,25
Courageously and with a free desire,25
Sound trumpets; and set forward combatants.,25
Stay the king hath thrown his warder down.,25
And both return back to their chairs again:,25
While we return these dukes what we decree.,25
Draw near,25
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd,25
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect,25
And for we think the eagle-winged pride,25
With rival-hating envy set on you,25
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;,25
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,25
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace,25
Therefore we banish you our territories:,25
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields,25
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.,25
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;,25
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.,25
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:,25
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;,25
Breathe I against thee upon pain of life.,25
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:,25
As to be cast forth in the common air,25
The language I have learn'd these forty years,25
And now my tongue's use is to me no more,25
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,25
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:,25
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;,25
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.,25
Too far in years to be a pupil now:,25
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?,25
After our sentence plaining comes too late.,25
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.,25
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;,25
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--,25
You never shall so help you truth and God!,25
Nor never look upon each other's face;,25
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;,25
To plot contrive or complot any ill,25
I swear.,25
Norfolk so far as to mine enemy:--,25
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.,25
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:,25
Since thou hast far to go bear not along,25
No Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,25
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!,25
And all too soon I fear the king shall rue.,25
Save back to England all the world's my way.,25
Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes,25
Hath from the number of his banish'd years,25
To HENRY BOLINGBROKE,25
Return with welcome home from banishment.,25
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs,25
I thank my liege that in regard of me,25
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;,25
Can change their moons and bring their times about,25
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;,25
And blindfold death not let me see my son.,25
But not a minute king that thou canst give:,25
And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow;,25
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;,25
But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.,25
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:,25
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.,25
You would have bid me argue like a father.,25
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:,25
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.,25
I was too strict to make mine own away;,25
Against my will to do myself this wrong.,25
Six years we banish him and he shall go.,25
Cousin farewell: what presence must not know,25
My lord no leave take I; for I will ride,25
O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,25
I have too few to take my leave of you,25
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.,25
Joy absent grief is present for that time.,25
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.,25
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,25
The sullen passage of thy weary steps,25
The precious jewel of thy home return.,25
Will but remember me what a deal of world,25
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood,25
Having my freedom boast of nothing else,25
All places that the eye of heaven visits,25
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;,25
Think not the king did banish thee,25
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.,25
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose,25
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:,25
To lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest:,25
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,25
Than a delightful measure or a dance;,25
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.,25
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?,25
By bare imagination of a feast?,25
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?,25
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:,25
Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore.,25
Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay.,25
My mother and my nurse that bears me yet!,25
Though banish'd yet a trueborn Englishman.,25
SCENE IV. The court.,25
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,25
I brought high Hereford if you call him so,25
And say what store of parting tears were shed?,25
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,25
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.,25
Farewell:',25
Should so profane the word that taught me craft,25
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.,25
And added years to his short banishment,25
But since it would not he had none of me.,25
When time shall call him home from banishment,25
Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green,25
How he did seem to dive into their hearts,25
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,25
And patient underbearing of his fortune,25
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;,25
And had the tribute of his supple knee,25
As were our England in reversion his,25
Well he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.,25
Expedient manage must be made my liege,25
For their advantage and your highness' loss.,25
And for our coffers with too great a court,25
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;,25
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,25
Whereto when they shall know what men are rich,25
And send them after to supply our wants;,25
Enter BUSHY,25
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord,25
To entreat your majesty to visit him.,25
At Ely House.,25
To help him to his grave immediately!,25
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.,25
Pray God we may make haste and come too late!,25
Exeunt,25
SCENE I. Ely House.,25
Will the king come that I may breathe my last,25
Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath;,25
O but they say the tongues of dying men,25
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain,25
He that no more must say is listen'd more,25
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:,25
As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last,25
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,25
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,25
Lascivious metres to whose venom sound,25
Report of fashions in proud Italy,25
Limps after in base imitation.,25
So it be new there's no respect how vile--,25
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,25
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:,25
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired,25
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,25
Small showers last long but sudden storms are short;,25
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:,25
Consuming means soon preys upon itself.,25
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars,25
This fortress built by Nature for herself,25
This happy breed of men this little world,25
Which serves it in the office of a wall,25
Against the envy of less happier lands,25
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings,25
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,25
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,25
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land,25
Is now leased out I die pronouncing it,25
England bound in with the triumphant sea,25
Of watery Neptune is now bound in with shame,25
That England that was wont to conquer others,25
Ah would the scandal vanish with my life,25
Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN DUKE OF AUMERLE  BUSHY GREEN BAGOT LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY,25
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.,25
What comfort man? how is't with aged Gaunt?,25
Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old:,25
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?,25
Watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt:,25
Is my strict fast; I mean my children's looks;,25
Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave,25
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?,25
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,25
Should dying men flatter with those that live?,25
Thou now a-dying say'st thou flatterest me.,25
I am in health I breathe and see thee ill.,25
Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill.,25
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;,25
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure,25
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,25
And yet incaged in so small a verge,25
O had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye,25
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,25
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.,25
It were a shame to let this land by lease;,25
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?,25
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--,25
Presuming on an ague's privilege,25
Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood,25
Now by my seat's right royal majesty,25
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head,25
O spare me not my brother Edward's son,25
That blood already like the pelican,25
My brother Gloucester plain well-meaning soul,25
May be a precedent and witness good,25
Join with the present sickness that I have;,25
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.,25
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!,25
Love they to live that love and honour have.,25
And let them die that age and sullens have;,25
I do beseech your majesty impute his words,25
He loves you on my life and holds you dear,25
Right you say true: as Hereford's love so his;,25
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND,25
What says he?,25
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;,25
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!,25
The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he;,25
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:,25
Which live like venom where no venom else,25
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,25
The plate corn revenues and moveables,25
How long shall I be patient? ah how long,25
Not Gloucester's death nor Hereford's banishment,25
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke,25
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,25
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,25
In war was never lion raged more fierce,25
Than was that young and princely gentleman.,25
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;,25
And not against his friends; his noble hand,25
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;,25
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.,25
Or else he never would compare between.,25
O my liege,25
Not to be pardon'd am content withal.,25
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?,25
Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true?,25
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?,25
His charters and his customary rights;,25
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king,25
Now afore God--God forbid I say true!--,25
Call in the letters patent that he hath,25
His livery and deny his offer'd homage,25
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,25
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.,25
His plate his goods his money and his lands.,25
What will ensue hereof there's none can tell;,25
That their events can never fall out good.,25
Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:,25
To see this business. To-morrow next,25
And we create in absence of ourself,25
For he is just and always loved us well.,25
Be merry for our time of stay is short,25
Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead.,25
Barely in title not in revenue.,25
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,25
Nay speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more,25
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?,25
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.,25
Unless you call it good to pity him,25
Now afore God 'tis shame such wrongs are borne,25
Of noble blood in this declining land.,25
By flatterers; and what they will inform,25
That will the king severely prosecute,25
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,25
For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.,25
As blanks benevolences and I wot not what:,25
Wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not,25
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:,25
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.,25
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.,25
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,25
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!,25
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;,25
And yet we strike not but securely perish.,25
And unavoided is the danger now,25
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death,25
How near the tidings of our comfort is.,25
Be confident to speak Northumberland:,25
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold.,25
In Brittany received intelligence,25
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,25
Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston,25
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne,25
Are making hither with all due expedience,25
Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay,25
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,25
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,25
And make high majesty look like itself,25
But if you faint as fearing to do so,25
To horse to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.,25
Exeunt,25
Enter QUEEN BUSHY and BAGOT,25
You promised when you parted with the king,25
And entertain a cheerful disposition.,25
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause,25
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest,25
Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb,25
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,25
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,25
For sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears,25
Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon,25
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,25
Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail;,25
Of what it is not. Then thrice-gracious queen,25
Or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye,25
It may be so; but yet my inward soul,25
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,25
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.,25
Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived,25
For nothing had begot my something grief;,25
Tis in reversion that I do possess;,25
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe I wot.,25
God save your majesty! and well met gentlemen:,25
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;,25
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?,25
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,25
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,25
At Ravenspurgh.,25
Ah madam 'tis too true: and that is worse,25
The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby,25
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland,25
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester,25
And all the household servants fled with him,25
So Green thou art the midwife to my woe,25
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,25
Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd.,25
Who shall hinder me?,25
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,25
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,25
Enter DUKE OF YORK,25
With signs of war about his aged neck:,25
Uncle for God's sake speak comfortable words.,25
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,25
Your husband he is gone to save far off,25
Here am I left to underprop his land,25
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;,25
Enter a Servant,25
He was? Why so! go all which way it will!,25
And will I fear revolt on Hereford's side.,25
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:,25
My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship,25
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.,25
An hour before I came the duchess died.,25
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!,25
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,25
What are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?,25
Come sister--cousin I would say--pray pardon me.,25
And bring away the armour that is there.,25
Gentlemen will you go muster men?,25
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,25
The one is my sovereign whom both my oath,25
Is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd,25
Well somewhat we must do. Come cousin I'll,25
Gentlemen go muster up your men,25
I should to Plashy too;,25
And every thing is left at six and seven.,25
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,25
Proportionable to the enemy,25
Besides our nearness to the king in love,25
And that's the wavering commons: for their love,25
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.,25
If judgement lie in them then so do we,25
Well I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:,25
Thither will I with you; for little office,25
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.,25
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.,25
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.,25
Alas poor duke! the task he undertakes,25
Where one on his side fights thousands will fly.,25
Well we may meet again.,25
Exeunt,25
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND with Forces,25
Believe me noble lord,25
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways,25
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,25
But I bethink me what a weary way,25
In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company,25
The tediousness and process of my travel:,25
The present benefit which I possess;,25
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords,25
By sight of what I have your noble company.,25
Than your good words. But who comes here?,25
It is my son young Harry Percy,25
Harry how fares your uncle?,25
Why is he not with the queen?,25
Broken his staff of office and dispersed,25
What was his reason?,25
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.,25
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,25
What power the Duke of York had levied there;,25
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy?,25
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,25
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.,25
Such as it is being tender raw and young:,25
To more approved service and desert.,25
I count myself in nothing else so happy,25
And as my fortune ripens with thy love,25
My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it.,25
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?,25
Mann'd with three hundred men as I have heard;,25
None else of name and noble estimate.,25
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,25
Welcome my lords. I wot your love pursues,25
Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd,25
Your presence makes us rich most noble lord.,25
Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor;,25
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?,25
It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess.,25
My lord my answer is--to Lancaster;,25
And I must find that title in your tongue,25
Mistake me not my lord; 'tis not my meaning,25
To you my lord I come what lord you will,25
The Duke of York to know what pricks you on,25
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.,25
I shall not need transport my words by you;,25
Kneels,25
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.,25
Tut tut!,25
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.',25
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs,25
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march,25
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war,25
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?,25
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.,25
As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself,25
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,25
Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee,25
My gracious uncle let me know my fault:,25
Even in condition of the worst degree,25
Thou art a banish'd man and here art come,25
In braving arms against thy sovereign.,25
But as I come I come for Lancaster.,25
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:,25
I see old Gaunt alive; O then my father,25
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties,25
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?,25
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.,25
Had you first died and he been thus trod down,25
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.,25
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:,25
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.,25
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;,25
To my inheritance of free descent.,25
It stands your grace upon to do him right.,25
My lords of England let me tell you this:,25
And laboured all I could to do him right;,25
Be his own carver and cut out his way,25
And you that do abet him in this kind,25
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is,25
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;,25
Well well I see the issue of these arms:,25
Because my power is weak and all ill left:,25
I would attach you all and make you stoop,25
But since I cannot be it known to you,25
Unless you please to enter in the castle,25
An offer uncle that we will accept:,25
To Bristol castle which they say is held,25
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,25
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;,25
Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are:,25
Exeunt,25
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain,25
And hardly kept our countrymen together,25
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.,25
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.,25
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd,25
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth,25
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,25
The other to enjoy by rage and war:,25
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,25
Exit,25
I see thy glory like a shooting star,25
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,25
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,25
Exit,25
SCENE I. Bristol. Before the castle.,25
Bring forth these men.,25
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--,25
For 'twere no charity; yet to wash your blood,25
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.,25
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,25
You have in manner with your sinful hours,25
Broke the possession of a royal bed,25
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.,25
Near to the king in blood and near in love,25
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,25
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;,25
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,25
Razed out my imprese leaving me no sign,25
To show the world I am a gentleman.,25
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over,25
More welcome is the stroke of death to me,25
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,25
My Lord Northumberland see them dispatch'd.,25
Uncle you say the queen is at your house;,25
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;,25
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd,25
Thank gentle uncle. Come lords away.,25
Awhile to work and after holiday.,25
SCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.,25
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?,25
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?,25
To stand upon my kingdom once again.,25
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:,25
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,25
And do thee favours with my royal hands.,25
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;,25
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,25
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:,25
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,25
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch,25
Mock not my senseless conjuration lords:,25
Prove armed soldiers ere her native king,25
Fear not my lord: that Power that made you king,25
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,25
And we will not heaven's offer we refuse,25
He means my lord that we are too remiss;,25
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.,25
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,25
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen,25
But when from under this terrestrial ball,25
And darts his light through every guilty hole,25
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,25
So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke,25
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,25
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,25
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.,25
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;,25
The deputy elected by the Lord:,25
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,25
A glorious angel: then if angels fight,25
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY,25
Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord,25
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.,25
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:,25
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!,25
O'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state:,25
Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled.,25
But now the blood of twenty thousand men,25
And till so much blood thither come again,25
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,25
Comfort my liege; remember who you are.,25
Awake thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.,25
Arm arm my name! a puny subject strikes,25
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?,25
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?,25
More health and happiness betide my liege,25
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;,25
Say is my kingdom lost? why 'twas my care,25
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?,25
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:,25
They break their faith to God as well as us:,25
The worst is death and death will have his day.,25
To bear the tidings of calamity.,25
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,25
So high above his limits swells the rage,25
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.,25
Against thy majesty; boys with women's voices,25
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:,25
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;,25
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,25
Too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.,25
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?,25
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?,25
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.,25
O villains vipers damn'd without redemption!,25
Snakes in my heart-blood warm'd that sting my heart!,25
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war,25
Sweet love I see changing his property,25
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made,25
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound,25
Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?,25
Where is the duke my father with his power?,25
Let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs;,25
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,25
And yet not so for what can we bequeath,25
Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,25
And that small model of the barren earth,25
For God's sake let us sit upon the ground,25
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,25
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;,25
That rounds the mortal temples of a king,25
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,25
To monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks,25
As if this flesh which walls about our life,25
Comes at the last and with a little pin,25
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood,25
Tradition form and ceremonious duty,25
I live with bread like you feel want,25
How can you say to me I am a king?,25
But presently prevent the ways to wail.,25
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,25
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:,25
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.,25
And learn to make a body of a limb.,25
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.,25
An easy task it is to win our own.,25
Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour.,25
The state and inclination of the day:,25
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.,25
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:,25
And all your northern castles yielded up,25
Upon his party.,25
Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth,25
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!,25
By heaven I'll hate him everlastingly,25
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;,25
That power I have discharge; and let them go,25
For I have none: let no man speak again,25
My liege one word.,25
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.,25
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.,25
SCENE III. Wales. Before Flint castle.,25
So that by this intelligence we learn,25
Is gone to meet the king who lately landed,25
The news is very fair and good my lord:,25
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland,25
When such a sacred king should hide his head.,25
Left I his title out.,25
Would you have been so brief with him he would,25
For taking so the head your whole head's length.,25
Take not good cousin further than you should.,25
I know it uncle and oppose not myself,25
Enter HENRY PERCY,25
The castle royally is mann'd my lord,25
Royally!,25
Yes my good lord,25
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:,25
Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman,25
O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.,25
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;,25
Into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver:,25
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,25
To his most royal person hither come,25
Provided that my banishment repeal'd,25
If not I'll use the advantage of my power,25
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:,25
It is such crimson tempest should bedrench,25
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.,25
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.,25
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements,25
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet,25
Of fire and water when their thundering shock,25
Be he the fire I'll be the yielding water:,25
My waters; on the earth and not on him.,25
Parle without and answer within. Then a flourish.  Enter on the walls KING RICHARD II the BISHOP OF  CARLISLE DUKE OF AUMERLE SIR STEPHEN SCROOP and EARL OF SALISBURY,25
As doth the blushing discontented sun,25
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent,25
Of his bright passage to the occident.,25
As bright as is the eagle's lightens forth,25
That any harm should stain so fair a show!,25
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,25
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:,25
To pay their awful duty to our presence?,25
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;,25
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,25
And though you think that all as you have done,25
And we are barren and bereft of friends;,25
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf,25
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,25
And threat the glory of my precious crown.,25
That every stride he makes upon my land,25
The purple testament of bleeding war;,25
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons,25
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace,25
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.,25
Should so with civil and uncivil arms,25
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;,25
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,25
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,25
And by the worth and honour of himself,25
His coming hither hath no further scope,25
Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:,25
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,25
To faithful service of your majesty.,25
And as I am a gentleman I credit him.,25
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;,25
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:,25
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.,25
To DUKE OF AUMERLE,25
Shall we call back Northumberland and send,25
No good my lord; let's fight with gentle words,25
O God O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,25
On yon proud man should take it off again,25
As is my grief or lesser than my name!,25
Or not remember what I must be now!,25
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.,25
What must the king do now? must he submit?,25
The king shall be contented: must he lose,25
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,25
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,25
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,25
And my large kingdom for a little grave,25
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,25
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;,25
And buried once why not upon my head?,25
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;,25
And make a dearth in this revolting land.,25
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?,25
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves,25
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.,25
I talk but idly and you laugh at me.,25
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty,25
You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay.,25
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.,25
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.,25
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.,25
down king!,25
should sing.,25
What says his majesty?,25
Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man,25
Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below,25
And show fair duty to his majesty.,25
My gracious lord--,25
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:,25
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.,25
Thus high at least although your knee be low.,25
Your own is yours and I am yours and all.,25
As my true service shall deserve your love.,25
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.,25
Tears show their love but want their remedies.,25
Though you are old enough to be my heir.,25
For do we must what force will have us do.,25
Yea my good lord.,25
Flourish. Exeunt,25
Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies,25
To drive away the heavy thought of care?,25
Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,25
Madam we'll dance.,25
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:,25
Madam we'll tell tales.,25
Of either madam.,25
For of joy being altogether wanting,25
Or if of grief being altogether had,25
For what I have I need not to repeat;,25
Madam I'll sing.,25
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.,25
And I could sing would weeping do me good,25
Enter a Gardener and two Servants,25
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.,25
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so,25
QUEEN and Ladies retire,25
Which like unruly children make their sire,25
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.,25
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,25
All must be even in our government.,25
The noisome weeds which without profit suck,25
Why should we in the compass of a pale,25
Showing as in a model our firm estate,25
Is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up,25
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs,25
Hold thy peace:,25
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:,25
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,25
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green.,25
They are; and Bolingbroke,25
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land,25
Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit-trees,25
With too much riches it confound itself:,25
They might have lived to bear and he to taste,25
We lop away that bearing boughs may live:,25
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.,25
Depress'd he is already and deposed,25
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,25
O I am press'd to death through want of speaking!,25
Thou old Adam's likeness set to dress this garden,25
What Eve what serpent hath suggested thee,25
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?,25
Divine his downfall? Say where when and how,25
Pardon me madam: little joy have I,25
King Richard he is in the mighty hold,25
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,25
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,25
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.,25
I speak no more than every one doth know.,25
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,25
To serve me last that I may longest keep,25
To meet at London London's king in woe.,25
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?,25
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.,25
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,25
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place,25
Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen,25
Exeunt,25
SCENE I. Westminster Hall.,25
Call forth Bagot.,25
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,25
The bloody office of his timeless end.,25
Cousin stand forth and look upon that man.,25
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.,25
I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length,25
As far as Calais to mine uncle's head?',25
I heard you say that you had rather refuse,25
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;,25
In this your cousin's death.,25
What answer shall I make to this base man?,25
On equal terms to give him chastisement?,25
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.,25
That marks thee out for hell: I say thou liest,25
In thy heart-blood though being all too base,25
Bagot forbear; thou shalt not take it up.,25
In all this presence that hath moved me so.,25
There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine:,25
I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it,25
If thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest;,25
Where it was forged with my rapier's point.,25
Now by my soul I would it were this hour.,25
Aumerle thou liest; his honour is as true,25
And that thou art so there I throw my gage,25
Of mortal breathing: seize it if thou darest.,25
And never brandish more revengeful steel,25
I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle;,25
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear,25
Engage it to the trial if thou darest.,25
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,25
My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well,25
Tis very true: you were in presence then;,25
As false by heaven as heaven itself is true.,25
Dishonourable boy!,25
That it shall render vengeance and revenge,25
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:,25
Engage it to the trial if thou darest.,25
If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live,25
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,25
To tie thee to my strong correction.,25
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:,25
That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men,25
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage,25
If he may be repeal'd to try his honour.,25
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,25
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,25
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.,25
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,25
Against black pagans Turks and Saracens:,25
To Italy; and there at Venice gave,25
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,25
Why bishop is Norfolk dead?,25
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom,25
Your differences shall all rest under gage,25
Enter DUKE OF YORK attended,25
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul,25
To the possession of thy royal hand:,25
And long live Henry fourth of that name!,25
Marry. God forbid!,25
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.,25
Were enough noble to be upright judge,25
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.,25
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?,25
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;,25
His captain steward deputy-elect,25
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,25
That in a Christian climate souls refined,25
I speak to subjects and a subject speaks,25
My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king,25
And if you crown him let me prophesy:,25
And future ages groan for this foul act;,25
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars,25
Disorder horror fear and mutiny,25
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.,25
It will the woefullest division prove,25
Prevent it resist it let it not be so,25
Well have you argued sir; and for your pains,25
My Lord of Westminster be it your charge,25
May it please you lords to grant the commons' suit.,25
He may surrender; so we shall proceed,25
I will be his conduct.,25
Lords you that here are under our arrest,25
Little are we beholding to your love,25
Re-enter DUKE OF YORK with KING RICHARD II and Officers bearing the regalia,25
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts,25
To insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs:,25
To this submission. Yet I well remember,25
Did they not sometime cry 'all hail!' to me?,25
Found truth in all but one: I in twelve thousand none.,25
Am I both priest and clerk? well then amen.,25
And yet amen if heaven do think him me.,25
To do that office of thine own good will,25
The resignation of thy state and crown,25
Give me the crown. Here cousin seize the crown;,25
On this side my hand and on that side yours.,25
That owes two buckets filling one another,25
The other down unseen and full of water:,25
Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high.,25
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:,25
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.,25
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.,25
Your care is gain of care by new care won:,25
They tend the crown yet still with me they stay.,25
Ay no; no ay; for I must nothing be;,25
Now mark me how I will undo myself;,25
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,25
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,25
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,25
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;,25
My acts decrees and statutes I deny:,25
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!,25
And thou with all pleased that hast all achieved!,25
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!,25
And send him many years of sunshine days!,25
No more but that you read,25
Committed by your person and your followers,25
That by confessing them the souls of men,25
Must I do so? and must I ravel out,25
If thy offences were upon record,25
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,25
Containing the deposing of a king,25
Mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven:,25
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,25
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates,25
And water cannot wash away your sin.,25
Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see:,25
But they can see a sort of traitors here.,25
I find myself a traitor with the rest;,25
To undeck the pompous body of a king;,25
Proud majesty a subject state a peasant.,25
No lord of thine thou haught insulting man,25
No not that name was given me at the font,25
That I have worn so many winters out,25
O that I were a mockery king of snow,25
To melt myself away in water-drops!,25
An if my word be sterling yet in England,25
That it may show me what a face I have,25
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.,25
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.,25
Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland.,25
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,25
Where all my sins are writ and that's myself.,25
Give me the glass and therein will I read.,25
So many blows upon this face of mine,25
Like to my followers in prosperity,25
That every day under his household roof,25
That like the sun did make beholders wink?,25
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?,25
As brittle as the glory is the face;,25
For there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers.,25
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.,25
The shadow or your face.,25
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:,25
And these external manners of laments,25
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;,25
For thy great bounty that not only givest,25
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,25
Shall I obtain it?,25
Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:,25
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,25
Being so great I have no need to beg.,25
And shall I have?,25
Then give me leave to go.,25
Whither you will so I were from your sights.,25
O good! convey? conveyers are you all,25
Exeunt KING RICHARD II some Lords and a Guard,25
Our coronation: lords prepare yourselves.,25
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.,25
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.,25
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?,25
Before I freely speak my mind herein,25
To bury mine intents but also to effect,25
I see your brows are full of discontent,25
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay,25
Exeunt,25
SCENE I. London. A street leading to the Tower.,25
This way the king will come; this is the way,25
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord,25
Here let us rest if this rebellious earth,25
Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard,25
My fair rose wither: yet look up behold,25
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.,25
Thou map of honour thou King Richard's tomb,25
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,25
Join not with grief fair woman do not so,25
To think our former state a happy dream;,25
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother sweet,25
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,25
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,25
What is my Richard both in shape and mind,25
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?,25
And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage,25
Take thy correction mildly kiss the rod,25
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?,25
I had been still a happy king of men.,25
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,25
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire,25
Of woeful ages long ago betid;,25
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,25
For why the senseless brands will sympathize,25
And in compassion weep the fire out;,25
For the deposing of a rightful king.,25
My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:,25
And madam there is order ta'en for you;,25
Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal,25
The time shall not be many hours of age,25
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,25
It is too little helping him to all;,25
To plant unrightful kings wilt know again,25
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.,25
That fear to hate and hate turns one or both,25
My guilt be on my head and there an end.,25
Doubly divorced! Bad men you violate,25
And then betwixt me and my married wife.,25
And yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made.,25
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;,25
She came adorned hither like sweet May,25
And must we be divided? must we part?,25
Banish us both and send the king with me.,25
Then whither he goes thither let me go.,25
Weep thou for me in France I for thee here;,25
Go count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.,25
Twice for one step I'll groan the way being short,25
Come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief,25
One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part;,25
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part,25
So now I have mine own again be gone,25
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:,25
Exeunt,25
Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK,25
When weeping made you break the story off,25
Where did I leave?,25
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops,25
Then as I said the duke great Bolingbroke,25
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,25
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,25
You would have thought the very windows spake,25
Through casements darted their desiring eyes,25
With painted imagery had said at once,25
Whilst he from the one side to the other turning,25
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you countrymen:',25
Alack poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?,25
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,25
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;,25
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!',25
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:,25
His face still combating with tears and smiles,25
That had not God for some strong purpose steel'd,25
And barbarism itself have pitied him.,25
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.,25
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.,25
Aumerle that was;,25
And madam you must call him Rutland now:,25
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.,25
Welcome my son: who are the violets now,25
Madam I know not nor I greatly care not:,25
Well bear you well in this new spring of time,25
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?,25
You will be there I know.,25
What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom?,25
My lord 'tis nothing.,25
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.,25
It is a matter of small consequence,25
Which for some reasons sir I mean to see.,25
What should you fear?,25
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.,25
That he is bound to? Wife thou art a fool.,25
I do beseech you pardon me; I may not show it.,25
He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it,25
What is the matter my lord?,25
Enter a Servant,25
God for his mercy what treachery is here!,25
Give me my boots I say; saddle my horse.,25
I will appeach the villain.,25
Peace foolish woman.,25
Good mother be content; it is no more,25
Thy life answer!,25
Re-enter Servant with boots,25
Hence villain! never more come in my sight.,25
Why York what wilt thou do?,25
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?,25
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,25
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?,25
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?,25
And interchangeably set down their hands,25
He shall be none;,25
Away fond woman! were he twenty times my son,25
Hadst thou groan'd for him,25
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect,25
And that he is a bastard not thy son:,25
He is as like thee as a man may be,25
And yet I love him.,25
Exit,25
Spur post and get before him to the king,25
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,25
And never will I rise up from the ground,25
Exeunt,25
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE HENRY PERCY and other Lords,25
Tis full three months since I did see him last;,25
I would to God my lords he might be found:,25
For there they say he daily doth frequent,25
Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes,25
Which he young wanton and effeminate boy,25
So dissolute a crew.,25
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.,25
His answer was he would unto the stews,25
And wear it as a favour; and with that,25
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both,25
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?,25
Where is the king?,25
So wildly?,25
To have some conference with your grace alone.,25
Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords,25
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,25
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.,25
If on the first how heinous e'er it be,25
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,25
Have thy desire.,25
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.,25
Drawing,25
[Within]  Open the door secure foolhardy king:,25
Open the door or I will break it open.,25
What is the matter uncle? speak;,25
That we may arm us to encounter it.,25
The treason that my haste forbids me show.,25
I do repent me; read not my name there,25
It was villain ere thy hand did set it down.,25
Fear and not love begets his penitence:,25
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.,25
O loyal father of a treacherous son!,25
From when this stream through muddy passages,25
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,25
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.,25
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,25
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,25
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,25
[Within]  What ho my liege! for God's sake,25
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?,25
Speak with me pity me open the door.,25
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,25
My dangerous cousin let your mother in:,25
If thou do pardon whosoever pray,25
This fester'd joint cut off the rest rest sound;,25
Enter DUCHESS OF YORK,25
Love loving not itself none other can.,25
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?,25
Kneels,25
Not yet I thee beseech:,25
And never see day that the happy sees,25
By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy.,25
Against them both my true joints bended be.,25
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;,25
His words come from his mouth ours from our breast:,25
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:,25
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:,25
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.,25
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.,25
Nay do not say 'stand up;',25
And if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach,25
I never long'd to hear a word till now;,25
The word is short but not so short as sweet;,25
Speak it in French king; say 'pardonne moi.',25
Ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord,25
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;,25
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;,25
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,25
Good aunt stand up.,25
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.,25
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!,25
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,25
With all my heart,25
A god on earth thou art.,25
With all the rest of that consorted crew,25
Good uncle help to order several powers,25
They shall not live within this world I swear,25
Uncle farewell: and cousin too adieu:,25
Come my old son: I pray God make thee new.,25
SCENE IV. The same.,25
Didst thou not mark the king what words he spake,25
Was it not so?,25
Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,25
He did.,25
And who should say 'I would thou wert the man',25
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come let's go:,25
Exeunt,25
Enter KING RICHARD,25
This prison where I live unto the world:,25
And here is not a creature but myself,25
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,25
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,25
In humours like the people of this world,25
As thoughts of things divine are intermix'd,25
Against the word:,25
It is as hard to come as for a camel,25
Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot,25
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs,25
And for they cannot die in their own pride.,25
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,25
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,25
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,25
Of such as have before endured the like.,25
And none contented: sometimes am I king;,25
And so I am: then crushing penury,25
Then am I king'd again: and by and by,25
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,25
With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased,25
Music,25
When time is broke and no proportion kept!,25
And here have I the daintiness of ear,25
But for the concord of my state and time,25
I wasted time and now doth time waste me;,25
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar,25
Whereto my finger like a dial's point,25
Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is,25
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans,25
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,25
This music mads me; let it sound no more;,25
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.,25
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard,25
Enter a Groom of the Stable,25
Thanks noble peer;,25
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,25
That brings me food to make misfortune live?,25
When thou wert king; who travelling towards York,25
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.,25
In London streets that coronation-day,25
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,25
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me gentle friend,25
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.,25
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;,25
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,25
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?,25
Since thou created to be awed by man,25
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,25
Enter Keeper with a dish,25
If thou love me 'tis time thou wert away.,25
Exit,25
Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.,25
lately came from the king commands the contrary.,25
Patience is stale and I am weary of it.,25
Help help help!,25
How now! what means death in this rude assault?,25
Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him,25
He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down,25
That staggers thus my person. Exton thy fierce hand,25
Mount mount my soul! thy seat is up on high;,25
Dies,25
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!,25
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.,25
Take hence the rest and give them burial here.,25
SCENE VI. Windsor castle.,25
Kind uncle York the latest news we hear,25
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;,25
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND,25
First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.,25
The heads of Oxford Salisbury Blunt and Kent:,25
At large discoursed in this paper here.,25
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.,25
My lord I have from Oxford sent to London,25
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors,25
Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot;,25
Enter HENRY PERCY and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,25
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,25
But here is Carlisle living to abide,25
Carlisle this is your doom:,25
More than thou hast and with it joy thy life;,25
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,25
Enter EXTON with persons bearing a coffin,25
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies,25
Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought.,25
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand,25
From your own mouth my lord did I this deed.,25
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,25
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,25
With Cain go wander through shades of night,25
Lords I protest my soul is full of woe,25
Come mourn with me for that I do lament,25
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,25
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;,25
Exeunt,25
SCENE I. London. A street.,26
Now is the winter of our discontent,26
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house,26
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;,26
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,26
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;,26
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,26
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.,26
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;,26
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;,26
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,26
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,26
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;,26
Have no delight to pass away the time,26
And descant on mine own deformity:,26
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,26
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.,26
By drunken prophecies libels and dreams,26
In deadly hate the one against the other:,26
As I am subtle false and treacherous,26
About a prophecy which says that 'G',26
Dive thoughts down to my soul: here,26
Enter CLARENCE guarded and BRAKENBURY,26
That waits upon your grace?,26
Tendering my person's safety hath appointed,26
Upon what cause?,26
Alack my lord that fault is none of yours;,26
O belike his majesty hath some intent,26
But what's the matter Clarence?  may I know?,26
As yet I do not: but as I can learn,26
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.,26
His issue disinherited should be;,26
It follows in his thought that I am he.,26
Have moved his highness to commit me now.,26
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:,26
That tempers him to this extremity.,26
Anthony Woodville her brother there,26
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?,26
By heaven I think there's no man is secure,26
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.,26
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?,26
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.,26
If we will keep in favour with the king,26
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,26
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.,26
His majesty hath straitly given in charge,26
Of what degree soever with his brother.,26
You may partake of any thing we say:,26
Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen,26
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,26
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:,26
With this my lord myself have nought to do.,26
He that doth naught with her excepting one,26
What one my lord?,26
I beseech your grace to pardon me and withal,26
We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey.,26
Brother farewell: I will unto the king;,26
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,26
Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood,26
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.,26
Meantime have patience.,26
Exeunt CLARENCE BRAKENBURY and Guard,26
Simple plain Clarence! I do love thee so,26
If heaven will take the present at our hands.,26
Enter HASTINGS,26
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!,26
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?,26
But I shall live my lord to give them thanks,26
No doubt no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;,26
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.,26
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.,26
No news so bad abroad as this at home;,26
And his physicians fear him mightily.,26
O he hath kept an evil diet long,26
Tis very grievous to be thought upon.,26
He is.,26
Exit HASTINGS,26
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.,26
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;,26
Clarence hath not another day to live:,26
And leave the world for me to bustle in!,26
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?,26
Is to become her husband and her father:,26
As for another secret close intent,26
But yet I run before my horse to market:,26
When they are gone then must I count my gains.,26
SCENE II. The same. Another street.,26
Set down set down your honourable load,26
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament,26
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!,26
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!,26
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,26
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!,26
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.,26
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!,26
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,26
Than I can wish to adders spiders toads,26
If ever he have child abortive be it,26
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect,26
And that be heir to his unhappiness!,26
A miserable by the death of him,26
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,26
And still as you are weary of the weight,26
Enter GLOUCESTER,26
What black magician conjures up this fiend,26
Villains set down the corse; or by Saint Paul,26
My lord stand back and let the coffin pass.,26
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,26
And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness.,26
Alas I blame you not; for you are mortal,26
Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell!,26
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.,26
Foul devil for God's sake hence and trouble us not;,26
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.,26
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.,26
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!,26
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood,26
Thy deed inhuman and unnatural,26
O God which this blood madest revenge his death!,26
Either heaven with lightning strike the,26
Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick,26
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!,26
Which renders good for bad blessings for curses.,26
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.,26
O wonderful when devils tell the truth!,26
Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman,26
By circumstance but to acquit myself.,26
For these known evils but to give me leave,26
Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have,26
Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make,26
By such despair I should accuse myself.,26
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,26
Say that I slew them not?,26
But dead they are and devilish slave by thee.,26
Why then he is alive.,26
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw,26
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,26
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,26
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.,26
Didst thou not kill this king?,26
Dost grant me hedgehog? then God grant me too,26
O he was gentle mild and virtuous!,26
He is in heaven where thou shalt never come.,26
For he was fitter for that place than earth.,26
Yes one place else if you will hear me name it.,26
Your bed-chamber.,26
So will it madam till I lie with you.,26
I know so. But gentle Lady Anne,26
And fall somewhat into a slower method,26
Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward,26
Thou art the cause and most accursed effect.,26
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep,26
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.,26
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.,26
You should not blemish it if I stood by:,26
So I by that; it is my day my life.,26
Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both.,26
It is a quarrel most unnatural,26
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,26
He that bereft thee lady of thy husband,26
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.,26
Name him.,26
Why that was he.,26
Where is he?,26
She spitteth at him,26
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake!,26
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.,26
Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine.,26
I would they were that I might die at once;,26
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,26
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,26
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made,26
Nor when thy warlike father like a child,26
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,26
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time,26
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,26
I never sued to friend nor enemy;,26
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,26
She looks scornfully at him,26
For kissing lady not for such contempt.,26
Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;,26
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,26
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.,26
Nay do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,26
Nay now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,26
Here she lets fall the sword,26
Arise dissembler: though I wish thy death,26
Then bid me kill myself and I will do it.,26
Tush that was in thy rage:,26
That hand which for thy love did kill thy love,26
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.,26
Tis figured in my tongue.,26
Then never man was true.,26
Say then my peace is made.,26
But shall I live in hope?,26
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.,26
Look how this ring encompasseth finger.,26
Wear both of them for both of them are thine.,26
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,26
What is it?,26
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,26
Where after I have solemnly interr'd,26
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,26
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,26
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,26
Tressel and Berkeley go along with me.,26
Tis more than you deserve;,26
Imagine I have said farewell already.,26
Sirs take up the corse.,26
No to White-Friars; there attend my coining.,26
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?,26
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.,26
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,26
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;,26
against me,26
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,26
Ha!,26
Edward her lord whom I some three months since,26
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,26
Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal,26
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,26
And made her widow to a woful bed?,26
On me that halt and am unshapen thus?,26
I do mistake my person all this while:,26
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.,26
And entertain some score or two of tailors,26
Since I am crept in favour with myself,26
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;,26
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass,26
Exit,26
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH RIVERS and GREY,26
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.,26
Therefore for God's sake entertain good comfort,26
If he were dead what would betide of me?,26
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.,26
To be your comforter when he is gone.,26
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,26
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?,26
But so it must be if the king miscarry.,26
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.,26
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!,26
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.,26
And loves not me be you good lord assured,26
I do beseech you either not believe,26
Or if she be accused in true report,26
From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.,26
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I,26
What likelihood of his amendment lords?,26
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?,26
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,26
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.,26
I fear our happiness is at the highest.,26
They do me wrong and I will not endure it:,26
That I forsooth am stern and love them not?,26
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.,26
Smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog,26
I must be held a rancorous enemy.,26
But thus his simple truth must be abused,26
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?,26
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?,26
A plague upon you all! His royal person--,26
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,26
Brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter.,26
And not provoked by any suitor else;,26
Which in your outward actions shows itself,26
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather,26
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,26
Since every Jack became a gentleman,26
Come come we know your meaning brother,26
You envy my advancement and my friends':,26
Meantime God grants that we have need of you:,26
Myself disgraced and the nobility,26
Are daily given to ennoble those,26
By Him that raised me to this careful height,26
I never did incense his majesty,26
An earnest advocate to plead for him.,26
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.,26
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.,26
She may Lord Rivers! why who knows not so?,26
She may help you to many fair preferments,26
And lay those honours on your high deserts.,26
What marry may she?,26
A bachelor a handsome stripling too:,26
My Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne,26
By heaven I will acquaint his majesty,26
I had rather be a country servant-maid,26
To be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at:,26
Small joy have I in being England's queen.,26
Thy honour state and seat is due to me.,26
Tell him and spare not: look what I have said,26
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.,26
Out devil! I remember them too well:,26
And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury.,26
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;,26
A liberal rewarder of his friends:,26
Yea and much better blood than his or thine.,26
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;,26
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?,26
What you have been ere now and what you are;,26
A murderous villain and so still thou art.,26
Yea and forswore himself--which Jesu pardon!--,26
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;,26
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's;,26
I am too childish-foolish for this world.,26
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.,26
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,26
So should we you if you should be our king.,26
Far be it from my heart the thought of it!,26
You should enjoy were you this country's king,26
That I enjoy being the queen thereof.,26
For I am she and altogether joyless.,26
Advancing,26
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!,26
If not that I being queen you bow like subjects,26
O gentle villain do not turn away!,26
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;,26
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?,26
Than death can yield me here by my abode.,26
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:,26
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.,26
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,26
And then to dry them gavest the duke a clout,26
His curses then from bitterness of soul,26
And God not we hath plagued thy bloody deed.,26
O 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,26
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.,26
Northumberland then present wept to see it.,26
Ready to catch each other by the throat,26
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?,26
Their kingdom's loss my woful banishment,26
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?,26
If not by war by surfeit die your king,26
Edward thy son which now is Prince of Wales,26
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!,26
Outlive thy glory like my wretched self!,26
And see another as I see thee now,26
Long die thy happy days before thy death;,26
Die neither mother wife nor England's queen!,26
And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son,26
That none of you may live your natural age,26
Have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag!,26
If heaven have any grievous plague in store,26
O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,26
On thee the troubler of the poor world's peace!,26
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,26
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,26
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!,26
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity,26
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!,26
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--,26
Richard!,26
I call thee not.,26
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.,26
O let me make the period to my curse!,26
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.,26
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,26
Fool fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.,26
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.,26
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.,26
Were you well served you would be taught your duty.,26
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects:,26
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.,26
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.,26
What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!,26
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.,26
It toucheth you my lord as much as me.,26
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,26
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!,26
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath,26
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.,26
As it was won with blood lost be it so!,26
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:,26
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.,26
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.,26
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,26
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!,26
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.,26
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.,26
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.,26
Look when he fawns he bites; and when he bites,26
Have not to do with him beware of him;,26
And all their ministers attend on him.,26
Nothing that I respect my gracious lord.,26
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?,26
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,26
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,26
Exit,26
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.,26
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent,26
I never did her any to my knowledge.,26
I was too hot to do somebody good,26
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid,26
God pardon them that are the cause of it!,26
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.,26
Aside,26
For had I cursed now I had cursed myself.,26
Madam his majesty doth call for you,26
Catesby we come. Lords will you go with us?,26
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER,26
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach,26
Clarence whom I indeed have laid in darkness,26
Namely to Hastings Derby Buckingham;,26
That stir the king against the duke my brother.,26
To be revenged on Rivers Vaughan Grey:,26
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:,26
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;,26
Enter two Murderers,26
How now my hardy stout resolved mates!,26
We are my lord; and come to have the warrant,26
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.,26
When you have done repair to Crosby Place.,26
Withal obdurate do not hear him plead;,26
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.,26
Fear not my lord we will not stand to prate;,26
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.,26
I like you lads; about your business straight;,26
We will my noble lord.,26
SCENE IV. London. The Tower.,26
Why looks your grace so heavily today?,26
So full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams,26
I would not spend another such a night,26
So full of dismal terror was the time!,26
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,26
And in my company my brother Gloucester;,26
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,26
During the wars of York and Lancaster,26
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,26
Struck me that thought to stay him overboard,26
Lord Lord! methought what pain it was to drown!,26
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!,26
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;,26
Inestimable stones unvalued jewels,26
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes,26
As 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems,26
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.,26
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?,26
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood,26
To seek the empty vast and wandering air;,26
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.,26
O no my dream was lengthen'd after life;,26
Who pass'd methought the melancholy flood,26
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.,26
Was my great father-in-law renowned Warwick;,26
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?',26
A shadow like an angel with bright hair,26
Clarence is come; false fleeting perjured Clarence,26
Seize on him Furies take him to your torments!',26
Environ'd me about and howled in mine ears,26
I trembling waked and for a season after,26
Such terrible impression made the dream.,26
I promise I am afraid to hear you tell it.,26
Which now bear evidence against my soul,26
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,26
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,26
I pray thee gentle keeper stay by me;,26
I will my lord: God give your grace good rest!,26
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,26
Princes have but their tides for their glories,26
And for unfelt imagination,26
So that betwixt their tides and low names,26
Enter the two Murderers,26
In God's name what are you and how came you hither?,26
Yea are you so brief?,26
him our commission; talk no more.,26
I am in this commanded to deliver,26
I will not reason what is meant hereby,26
Here are the keys there sits the duke asleep:,26
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.,26
Exit BRAKENBURY,26
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly when he wakes.,26
the judgment-day.,26
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind,26
What art thou afraid?,26
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us.,26
So I am to let him live.,26
I pray thee stay a while: I hope my holy humour,26
would tell twenty.,26
Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet,26
Remember our reward when the deed is done.,26
Where is thy conscience now?,26
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,26
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.,26
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it,26
accuseth him; he cannot swear but it cheques him;,26
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that,26
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold,26
is turned out of all towns and cities for a,26
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live,26
Zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me,26
Take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not: he,26
Tut I am strong-framed he cannot prevail with me,26
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his,26
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy,26
in the next room.,26
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?,26
Where art thou keeper? give me a cup of wine.,26
In God's name what art thou?,26
But not as I am royal.,26
Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble.,26
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!,26
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?,26
To murder me?,26
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,26
Wherein my friends have I offended you?,26
I shall be reconciled to him again.,26
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men,26
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?,26
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced,26
Before I be convict by course of law,26
I charge you as you hope to have redemption,26
That you depart and lay no hands on me,26
What we will do we do upon command.,26
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings,26
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou then,26
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,26
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,26
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,26
And like a traitor to the name of God,26
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.,26
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,26
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?,26
He sends ye not to murder me for this,26
If God will be revenged for this deed.,26
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;,26
To cut off those that have offended him.,26
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,26
My brother's love the devil and my rage.,26
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.,26
I am his brother and I love him well.,26
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,26
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.,26
O no he loves me and he holds me dear:,26
Ay so we will.,26
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,26
He little thought of this divided friendship:,26
Ay millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.,26
Right,26
Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.,26
He hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs,26
Why so he doth now he delivers thee,26
Make peace with God for you must die my lord.,26
To counsel me to make my peace with God,26
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?,26
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.,26
Relent and save your souls.,26
Not to relent is beastly savage devilish.,26
Being pent from liberty as I am now,26
Would not entreat for life?,26
O if thine eye be not a flatterer,26
As you would beg were you in my distress,26
Look behind you my lord.,26
Stabs him,26
Exit with the body,26
How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands,26
Re-enter First Murderer,26
By heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art!,26
Take thou the fee and tell him what I say;,26
Exit,26
Now must I hide his body in some hole,26
And when I have my meed I must away;,26
ACT II,26
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick QUEEN  ELIZABETH DORSET RIVERS HASTINGS BUCKINGHAM GREY and others,26
You peers continue this united league:,26
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;,26
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.,26
Dissemble not your hatred swear your love.,26
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.,26
Take heed you dally not before your king;,26
Confound your hidden falsehood and award,26
So prosper I as I swear perfect love!,26
Madam yourself are not exempt in this,26
You have been factious one against the other,26
And what you do do it unfeignedly.,26
Our former hatred so thrive I and mine!,26
This interchange of love I here protest,26
And so swear I my lord,26
Now princely Buckingham seal thou this league,26
And make me happy in your unity.,26
On you or yours,26
but with all duteous love,26
With hate in those where I expect most love!,26
And most assured that he is a friend,26
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,26
A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham,26
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,26
And in good time here comes the noble duke.,26
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:,26
Happy indeed as we have spent the day.,26
Made peace enmity fair love of hate,26
A blessed labour my most sovereign liege:,26
By false intelligence or wrong surmise,26
If I unwittingly or in my rage,26
By any in this presence I desire,26
Tis death to me to be at enmity;,26
First madam I entreat true peace of you,26
Of you my noble cousin Buckingham,26
Of you Lord Rivers and Lord Grey of you;,26
Dukes earls lords gentlemen; indeed of all.,26
With whom my soul is any jot at odds,26
I thank my God for my humility.,26
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.,26
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.,26
To be so bouted in this royal presence?,26
They all start,26
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?,26
Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest?,26
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.,26
But he poor soul by your first order died,26
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,26
God grant that some less noble and less loyal,26
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,26
Enter DERBY,26
I pray thee peace: my soul is full of sorrow.,26
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.,26
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman,26
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,26
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,26
Who sued to me for him? who in my rage,26
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?,26
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?,26
When Oxford had me down he rescued me,26
Who told me when we both lay in the field,26
Even in his own garments and gave himself,26
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath,26
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.,26
Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced,26
You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon;,26
But for my brother not a man would speak,26
For him poor soul. The proudest of you all,26
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.,26
On me and you and mine and yours for this!,26
Oh poor Clarence!,26
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not,26
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?,26
God will revenge it. But come let us in,26
We wait upon your grace.,26
SCENE II. The palace.,26
Tell me good grandam is our father dead?,26
Why do you wring your hands and beat your breast,26
Why do you look on us and shake your head,26
If that our noble father be alive?,26
I do lament the sickness of the king.,26
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.,26
The king my uncle is to blame for this:,26
With daily prayers all to that effect.,26
Peace children peace! the king doth love you well:,26
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.,26
Told me the king provoked by the queen,26
And when my uncle told me so he wept,26
Bade me rely on him as on my father,26
Oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,26
He is my son; yea and therein my shame;,26
Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam?,26
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?,26
Oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep,26
I'll join with black despair against my soul,26
What means this scene of rude impatience?,26
Edward my lord your son our king is dead.,26
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?,26
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;,26
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.,26
As I had title in thy noble husband!,26
And lived by looking on his images:,26
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,26
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.,26
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:,26
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,26
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,26
Good aunt you wept not for our father's death;,26
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;,26
Give me no help in lamentation;,26
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,26
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!,26
Oh for our father for our dear lord Clarence!,26
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.,26
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.,26
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!,26
Alas I am the mother of these moans!,26
She for an Edward weeps and so do I;,26
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;,26
Alas you three on me threefold distress'd,26
And I will pamper it with lamentations.,26
That you take with unthankfulness his doing:,26
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt,26
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,26
Madam bethink you like a careful mother,26
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:,26
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.,26
Madam have comfort: all of us have cause,26
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.,26
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee,26
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,26
[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!,26
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.,26
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,26
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,26
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,26
Must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept:,26
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd,26
Why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham?,26
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,26
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:,26
And may direct his course as please himself,26
In my opinion ought to be prevented.,26
And the compact is firm and true in me.,26
Yet since it is but green it should be put,26
Which haply by much company might be urged:,26
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.,26
Then be it so; and go we to determine,26
Madam and you my mother will you go,26
With all our harts.,26
My lord whoever journeys to the Prince,26
For by the way I'll sort occasion,26
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.,26
My oracle my prophet! My dear cousin,26
Towards Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind.,26
SCENE III. London. A street.,26
Neighbour well met: whither away so fast?,26
Hear you the news abroad?,26
Bad news by'r lady; seldom comes the better:,26
Enter another Citizen,26
Give you good morrow sir.,26
Ay sir it is too true; God help the while!,26
No no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.,26
In him there is a hope of government,26
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,26
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth,26
Stood the state so? No no good friends God wot;,26
With politic grave counsel; then the king,26
Why so hath this both by the father and mother.,26
Or by the father there were none at all;,26
Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.,26
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:,26
This sickly land might solace as before.,26
When clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks;,26
When the sun sets who doth not look for night?,26
All may be well; but if God sort it so,26
Truly the souls of men are full of dread:,26
That looks not heavily and full of fear.,26
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust,26
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.,26
Marry we were sent for to the justices.,26
Exeunt,26
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK young YORK QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK,26
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:,26
I long with all my heart to see the prince:,26
But I hear no; they say my son of York,26
Ay mother; but I would not have it so.,26
Grandam one night as we did sit at supper,26
More than my brother: 'Ay' quoth my uncle,26
Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace:',26
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.,26
In him that did object the same to thee;,26
So long a-growing and so leisurely,26
Why madam so no doubt he is.,26
Now by my troth if I had been remember'd,26
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.,26
Marry they say my uncle grew so fast,26
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.,26
I pray thee pretty York who told thee this?,26
His nurse! why she was dead ere thou wert born.,26
A parlous boy: go to you are too shrewd.,26
Pitchers have ears.,26
Here comes a messenger. What news?,26
How fares the prince?,26
What is thy news then?,26
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners.,26
The mighty dukes,26
For what offence?,26
Why or for what these nobles were committed,26
Ay me I see the downfall of our house!,26
Insulting tyranny begins to jet,26
Welcome destruction death and massacre!,26
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,26
My husband lost his life to get the crown;,26
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:,26
Clean over-blown themselves the conquerors.,26
Self against self: O preposterous,26
Or let me die to look on death no more!,26
Madam farewell.,26
You have no cause.,26
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.,26
The seal I keep: and so betide to me,26
Come I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.,26
ACT III,26
The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM CARDINAL CATESBY and others,26
Welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign,26
No uncle; but our crosses on the way,26
I want more uncles here to welcome me.,26
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit,26
Than of his outward show; which God he knows,26
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;,26
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :,26
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.,26
Enter the Lord Mayor and his train,26
I thank you good my lord; and thank you all.,26
Would long ere this have met us on the way,26
To tell us whether they will come or no!,26
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.,26
On what occasion God he knows not I,26
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince,26
But by his mother was perforce withheld.,26
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal will your grace,26
Unto his princely brother presently?,26
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.,26
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,26
To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid,26
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land,26
You are too senseless--obstinate my lord,26
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,26
The benefit thereof is always granted,26
And those who have the wit to claim the place:,26
And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it:,26
You break no privilege nor charter there.,26
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.,26
Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me?,26
Good lords make all the speedy haste you may.,26
Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come,26
Where it seems best unto your royal self.,26
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:,26
For your best health and recreation.,26
Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord?,26
Which since succeeding ages have re-edified.,26
Successively from age to age he built it?,26
But say my lord it were not register'd,26
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,26
[Aside]  So wise so young they say do never,26
What say you uncle?,26
Aside,26
I moralize two meanings in one word.,26
With what his valour did enrich his wit,26
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;,26
I'll tell you what my cousin Buckingham--,26
An if I live until I be a man,26
Or die a soldier as I lived a king.,26
Enter young YORK HASTINGS and the CARDINAL,26
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?,26
Ay brother to our grief as it is yours:,26
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.,26
I thank you gentle uncle. O my lord,26
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.,26
And therefore is he idle?,26
Then is he more beholding to you than I.,26
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.,26
My dagger little cousin? with all my heart.,26
Of my kind uncle that I know will give;,26
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.,26
A gentle cousin were it light enough.,26
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.,26
I weigh it lightly were it heavier.,26
I would that I might thank you as you call me.,26
Little.,26
Uncle your grace knows how to bear with him.,26
Uncle my brother mocks both you and me;,26
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.,26
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,26
So cunning and so young is wonderful.,26
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham,26
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.,26
My lord protector needs will have it so.,26
Why what should you fear?,26
My grandam told me he was murdered there.,26
Nor none that live I hope.,26
But come my lord; and with a heavy heart,26
A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY,26
Was not incensed by his subtle mother,26
No doubt no doubt; O 'tis a parlous boy;,26
He is all the mother's from the top to toe.,26
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend,26
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;,26
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,26
In the seat royal of this famous isle?,26
That he will not be won to aught against him.,26
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.,26
And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,26
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,26
If thou dost find him tractable to us,26
If he be leaden icy-cold unwilling,26
And give us notice of his inclination:,26
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.,26
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries,26
And bid my friend for joy of this good news,26
Good Catesby go effect this business soundly.,26
Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep?,26
At Crosby Place there shall you find us both.,26
Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive,26
Chop off his head man; somewhat we will do:,26
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables,26
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.,26
Come let us sup betimes that afterwards,26
Exeunt,26
Enter a Messenger,26
[Within]  Who knocks at the door?,26
Enter HASTINGS,26
Upon the stroke of four.,26
So it should seem by that I have to say.,26
And then?,26
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:,26
And that may be determined at the one,26
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,26
And with all speed post with him toward the north,26
Go fellow go return unto thy lord;,26
His honour and myself are at the one,26
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us,26
Tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance:,26
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers,26
Were to incense the boar to follow us,26
Go bid thy master rise and come to me,26
Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.,26
Exit,26
Many good morrows to my noble lord!,26
What news what news in this our tottering state?,26
And I believe twill never stand upright,26
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?,26
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders,26
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?,26
Upon his party for the gain thereof:,26
That this same very day your enemies,26
Indeed I am no mourner for that news,26
But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,26
God knows I will not do it to the death.,26
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,26
I live to look upon their tragedy.,26
What my lord?,26
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.,26
When men are unprepared and look not for it.,26
With Rivers Vaughan Grey: and so 'twill do,26
As thou and I; who as thou know'st are dear,26
The princes both make high account of you;,26
For they account his head upon the bridge.,26
Enter STANLEY,26
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?,26
You may jest on but by the holy rood,26
My lord,26
And never in my life I do protest,26
Think you but that I know our state secure,26
The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London,26
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;,26
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:,26
What shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.,26
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.,26
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.,26
Enter a Pursuivant,26
Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY,26
The better that your lordship please to ask.,26
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:,26
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;,26
This day those enemies are put to death,26
God hold it to your honour's good content!,26
Throws him his purse,26
Exit,26
Well met my lord; I am glad to see your honour.,26
I am in your debt for your last exercise;,26
He whispers in his ear,26
What talking with a priest lord chamberlain?,26
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.,26
Those men you talk of came into my mind.,26
I do my lord; but long I shall not stay,26
Tis like enough for I stay dinner there.,26
Come will you go?,26
Exeunt,26
Enter RATCLIFF with halberds carrying RIVERS GREY and VAUGHAN to death,26
Sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this:,26
For truth for duty and for loyalty.,26
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!,26
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.,26
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!,26
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;,26
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.,26
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.,26
Then cursed she Richard. O remember God,26
And for my sister and her princely sons,26
Which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt.,26
Come Grey come Vaughan let us all embrace:,26
Exeunt,26
Enter BUCKINGHAM DERBY HASTINGS the BISHOP OF  ELY RATCLIFF LOVEL with others and take their seats at a table,26
Is to determine of the coronation.,26
Are all things fitting for that royal time?,26
To-morrow then I judge a happy day.,26
Who is most inward with the royal duke?,26
Who I my lord I we know each other's faces,26
Than I of yours;,26
Lord Hastings you and he are near in love.,26
But for his purpose in the coronation.,26
His gracious pleasure any way therein:,26
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,26
Enter GLOUCESTER,26
My noble lords and cousins all good morrow.,26
My absence doth neglect no great designs,26
Had not you come upon your cue my lord,26
I mean your voice--for crowning of the king.,26
His lordship knows me well and loves me well.,26
My lord of Ely!,26
When I was last in Holborn,26
I do beseech you send for some of them.,26
Exit,26
Drawing him aside,26
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,26
His master's son as worshipful as he terms it,26
Withdraw you hence my lord I'll follow you.,26
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.,26
For I myself am not so well provided,26
Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY,26
strawberries.,26
There's some conceit or other likes him well,26
I think there's never a man in Christendom,26
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.,26
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?,26
For were he he had shown it in his looks.,26
Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM,26
That do conspire my death with devilish plots,26
Upon my body with their hellish charms?,26
Makes me most forward in this noble presence,26
I say my lord they have deserved death.,26
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm,26
And this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch,26
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.,26
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--,26
Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear,26
Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done:,26
Exeunt all but HASTINGS RATCLIFF and LOVEL,26
For I too fond might have prevented this.,26
But I disdain'd it and did scorn to fly:,26
And startled when he look'd upon the Tower,26
O now I want the priest that spake to me:,26
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,26
And I myself secure in grace and favour.,26
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!,26
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.,26
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!,26
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,26
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.,26
O bloody Richard! miserable England!,26
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.,26
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.,26
SCENE V. The Tower-walls.,26
Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour,26
And then begin again and stop again,26
Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;,26
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,26
Are at my service like enforced smiles;,26
At any time to grace my stratagems.,26
He is; and see he brings the mayor along.,26
Lord mayor--,26
Hark! a drum.,26
Lord mayor the reason we have sent--,26
God and our innocency defend and guard us!,26
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF with HASTINGS' head,26
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.,26
I took him for the plainest harmless creature,26
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded,26
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,26
I mean his conversation with Shore's wife,26
Well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor,26
Would you imagine or almost believe,26
We live to tell it you the subtle traitor,26
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?,26
What think You we are Turks or infidels?,26
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,26
The peace of England and our persons' safety,26
Now fair befall you! he deserved his death;,26
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.,26
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.,26
Until your lordship came to see his death;,26
Somewhat against our meaning have prevented:,26
The traitor speak and timorously confess,26
That you might well have signified the same,26
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.,26
As well as I had seen and heard him speak,26
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens,26
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,26
But since you come too late of our intents,26
And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell.,26
Go after after cousin Buckingham.,26
There at your meet'st advantage of the time,26
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,26
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,26
Moreover urge his hateful luxury,26
Which stretched to their servants daughters wives,26
Without control listed to make his prey.,26
Tell them when that my mother went with child,26
My princely father then had wars in France,26
Found that the issue was not his begot;,26
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:,26
Because you know my lord my mother lives.,26
As if the golden fee for which I plead,26
If you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle;,26
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.,26
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.,26
Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw;,26
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both,26
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER,26
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;,26
At any time have recourse unto the princes.,26
SCENE VI. The same.,26
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;,26
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.,26
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,26
The precedent was full as long a-doing:,26
Untainted unexamined free at liberty,26
That seeth not this palpable device?,26
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,26
Exit,26
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM at several doors,26
Now by the holy mother of our Lord,26
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?,26
And his contract by deputy in France;,26
And his enforcement of the city wives;,26
As being got your father then in France,26
Withal I did infer your lineaments,26
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;,26
Your dicipline in war wisdom in peace,26
Indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose,26
And when mine oratory grew to an end,26
Cry 'God save Richard England's royal king!',26
No so God help me they spake not a word;,26
Gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale.,26
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:,26
To be spoke to but by the recorder.,26
Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd;',26
When he had done some followers of mine own,26
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!',26
Thanks gentle citizens and friends' quoth I;,26
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:',26
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?,26
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?,26
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit:,26
And stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord;,26
And be not easily won to our request:,26
I go; and if you plead as well for them,26
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.,26
Exit GLOUCESTER,26
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;,26
Enter CATESBY,26
What says he?,26
To visit him to-morrow or next day:,26
Divinely bent to meditation;,26
To draw him from his holy exercise.,26
Tell him myself the mayor and citizens,26
No less importing than our general good,26
I'll tell him what you say my lord.,26
Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward!,26
But on his knees at meditation;,26
But meditating with two deep divines;,26
But praying to enrich his watchful soul:,26
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:,26
Marry God forbid his grace should say us nay!,26
Re-enter CATESBY,26
My lord,26
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,26
My lord he fears you mean no good to him.,26
Suspect me that I mean no good to him:,26
And so once more return and tell his grace.,26
When holy and devout religious men,26
So sweet is zealous contemplation.,26
See where he stands between two clergymen!,26
To stay him from the fall of vanity:,26
True ornaments to know a holy man.,26
Lend favourable ears to our request;,26
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.,26
I rather do beseech you pardon me,26
Neglect the visitation of my friends.,26
Even that I hope which pleaseth God above,26
I do suspect I have done some offence,26
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.,26
At our entreaties to amend that fault!,26
Then know it is your fault that you resign,26
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,26
The lineal glory of your royal house,26
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,26
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;,26
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,26
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.,26
Your gracious self to take on you the charge,26
Not as protector steward substitute,26
But as successively from blood to blood,26
For this consorted with the citizens,26
And by their vehement instigation,26
I know not whether to depart in silence,26
Best fitteth my degree or your condition,26
Tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded,26
Which fondly you would here impose on me;,26
So season'd with your faithful love to me.,26
Therefore to speak and to avoid the first,26
Definitively thus I answer you.,26
Unmeritable shuns your high request.,26
And that my path were even to the crown,26
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,26
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,26
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,26
But God be thank'd there's no need of me,26
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,26
Will well become the seat of majesty,26
On him I lay what you would lay on me,26
Which God defend that I should wring from him!,26
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,26
You say that Edward is your brother's son:,26
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--,26
And afterward by substitute betroth'd,26
These both put by a poor petitioner,26
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,26
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,26
To base declension and loathed bigamy,26
This Edward whom our manners term the prince.,26
Save that for reverence to some alive,26
Then good my lord take to your royal self,26
If non to bless us and the land withal,26
From the corruption of abusing times,26
Do good my lord your citizens entreat you.,26
O make them joyful grant their lawful suit!,26
I am unfit for state and majesty;,26
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.,26
Loath to depose the child Your brother's son;,26
And gentle kind effeminate remorse,26
And egally indeed to all estates--,26
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;,26
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:,26
Come citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.,26
Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens,26
Do good my lord lest all the land do rue it.,26
Well call them again. I am not made of stone,26
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.,26
Cousin of Buckingham and you sage grave men,26
To bear her burthen whether I will or no,26
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach,26
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me,26
For God he knows and you may partly see,26
God bless your grace! we see it and will say it.,26
Then I salute you with this kingly title:,26
Amen.,26
Even when you please since you will have it so.,26
And so most joyfully we take our leave.,26
Farewell good cousin; farewell gentle friends.,26
ACT IV,26
Enter on one side QUEEN ELIZABETH DUCHESS OF  YORK and DORSET; on the other ANNE Duchess of  Gloucester leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet CLARENCE's young Daughter,26
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?,26
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.,26
God give your graces both,26
As much to you good sister! Whither away?,26
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,26
Kind sister thanks: we'll enter all together.,26
And in good time here the lieutenant comes.,26
How doth the prince and my young son of York?,26
I may not suffer you to visit them;,26
The king! why who's that?,26
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!,26
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?,26
Their aunt I am in law in love their mother:,26
And take thy office from thee on my peril.,26
I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me.,26
Enter LORD STANLEY,26
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,26
To LADY ANNE,26
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.,26
May have some scope to beat or else I swoon,26
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!,26
O Dorset speak not to me get thee hence!,26
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.,26
And live with Richmond from the reach of hell,26
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;,26
Nor mother wife nor England's counted queen.,26
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;,26
To meet you on the way and welcome you.,26
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!,26
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,26
Come madam come; I in all haste was sent.,26
I would to God that the inclusive verge,26
Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain!,26
And die ere men can say God save the queen!,26
To feed my humour wish thyself no harm.,26
Came to me as I follow'd Henry's corse,26
Which issued from my other angel husband,26
O when I say I look'd on Richard's face,26
For making me so young so old a widow!,26
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--,26
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!,26
Even in so short a space my woman's heart,26
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,26
For never yet one hour in his bed,26
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.,26
And will no doubt shortly be rid of me.,26
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.,26
Adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it!,26
Go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee!,26
Go thou to Richard and good angels guard thee!,26
Go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee!,26
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,26
Stay yet look back with me unto the Tower.,26
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!,26
Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow,26
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.,26
SCENE II. London. The palace.,26
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!,26
Give me thy hand.,26
Thus high by thy advice,26
But shall we wear these honours for a day?,26
Still live they and for ever may they last!,26
To try if thou be current gold indeed,26
Say on my loving lord.,26
Why so you are my thrice renowned liege.,26
True noble prince.,26
That Edward still should live! 'True noble prince!',26
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;,26
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.,26
Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth:,26
Give me some breath some little pause my lord,26
I will resolve your grace immediately.,26
[Aside to a stander by],26
I will converse with iron-witted fools,26
That look into me with considerate eyes:,26
Boy!,26
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold,26
My lord I know a discontented gentleman,26
Gold were as good as twenty orators,26
What is his name?,26
I partly know the man: go call him hither.,26
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham,26
Hath he so long held out with me untired,26
Enter STANLEY,26
My lord I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled,26
Where he abides.,26
Catesby!,26
Rumour it abroad,26
I will take order for her keeping close.,26
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:,26
Look how thou dream'st! I say again give out,26
About it; for it stands me much upon,26
Exit CATESBY,26
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.,26
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in,26
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.,26
Is thy name Tyrrel?,26
Art thou indeed?,26
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?,26
But I had rather kill two enemies.,26
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers,26
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower.,26
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.,26
Go by this token: rise and lend thine ear:,26
There is no more but so: say it is done,26
Tis done my gracious lord.,26
Ye shall my Lord.,26
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM,26
The late demand that you did sound me in.,26
I hear that news my lord.,26
My lord I claim your gift my due by promise,26
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables,26
Stanley look to your wife; if she convey,26
What says your highness to my just demand?,26
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,26
A king perhaps perhaps--,26
How chance the prophet could not at that time,26
My lord your promise for the earldom--,26
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,26
Because a bard of Ireland told me once,26
My Lord!,26
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind,26
Well but what's o'clock?,26
Well let it strike.,26
Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the stroke,26
I am not in the giving vein to-day.,26
Tut tut,26
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM,26
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?,26
To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!,26
SCENE III. The same.,26
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.,26
That ever yet this land was guilty of.,26
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,26
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion,26
Lo thus' quoth Dighton 'lay those tender babes:',26
Within their innocent alabaster arms:,26
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.,26
Which once' quoth Forrest 'almost changed my mind;,26
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered,26
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.',26
They could not speak; and so I left them both,26
And here he comes.,26
All hail my sovereign liege!,26
If to have done the thing you gave in charge,26
For it is done my lord.,26
I did my lord.,26
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;,26
Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper,26
Meantime but think how I may do thee good,26
Farewell till soon.,26
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;,26
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,26
Now for I know the Breton Richmond aims,26
And by that knot looks proudly o'er the crown,26
Enter CATESBY,26
Good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly?,26
And Buckingham back'd with the hardy Welshmen,26
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near,26
Come I have heard that fearful commenting,26
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary,26
Jove's Mercury and herald for a king!,26
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.,26
SCENE IV. Before the palace.,26
So now prosperity begins to mellow,26
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,26
A dire induction am I witness to,26
Will prove as bitter black and tragical.,26
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK,26
My unblown flowers new-appearing sweets!,26
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,26
And hear your mother's lamentation!,26
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.,26
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,26
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.,26
Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs,26
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?,26
Blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost,26
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,26
Sitting down,26
O that thou wouldst as well afford a grave,26
Then would I hide my bones not rest them here.,26
Sitting down by her,26
Give mine the benefit of seniory,26
If sorrow can admit society,26
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:,26
I had a Harry till a Richard kill'd him:,26
Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him;,26
I had a Rutland too thou holp'st to kill him.,26
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept,26
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes,26
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,26
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,26
O upright just and true-disposing God,26
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,26
O Harry's wife triumph not in my woes!,26
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,26
Thy Edward he is dead that stabb'd my Edward:,26
Young York he is but boot because both they,26
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;,26
The adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey,26
Richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer,26
And send them thither: but at hand at hand,26
Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray.,26
Cancel his bond of life dear God I prey,26
O thou didst prophesy the time would come,26
That bottled spider that foul bunch-back'd toad!,26
I call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen;,26
The flattering index of a direful pageant;,26
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;,26
A sign of dignity a garish flag,26
A queen in jest only to fill the scene.,26
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou joy?,26
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?,26
Decline all this and see what now thou art:,26
For joyful mother one that wails the name;,26
For one being sued to one that humbly sues;,26
For one being fear'd of all now fearing one;,26
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,26
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,26
Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not,26
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;,26
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.,26
These English woes will make me smile in France.,26
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!,26
Compare dead happiness with living woe;,26
And he that slew them fouler than he is:,26
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.,26
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.,26
Why should calamity be full of words?,26
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,26
Let them have scope: though what they do impart,26
If so then be not tongue-tied: go with me.,26
My damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd.,26
Enter KING RICHARD III marching with drums and trumpets,26
O she that might have intercepted thee,26
From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done!,26
Where should be graven if that right were right,26
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?,26
Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence?,26
Where is kind Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey?,26
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women,26
Flourish. Alarums,26
Or with the clamorous report of war,26
Art thou my son?,26
Then patiently hear my impatience.,26
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.,26
Do then: but I'll not hear.,26
And brief good mother; for I am in haste.,26
God knows in anguish pain and agony.,26
No by the holy rood thou know'st it well,26
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;,26
Thy school-days frightful desperate wild and furious,26
Thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody,26
More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred:,26
That ever graced me in thy company?,26
your grace,26
If I be so disgracious in your sight,26
Strike the drum.,26
You speak too bitterly.,26
For I shall never speak to thee again.,26
Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance,26
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish,26
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;,26
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!,26
And there the little souls of Edward's children,26
And promise them success and victory.,26
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.,26
Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse,26
Stay madam; I must speak a word with you.,26
For thee to murder: for my daughters Richard,26
And therefore level not to hit their lives.,26
Virtuous and fair royal and gracious.,26
And I'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty;,26
Throw over her the veil of infamy:,26
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.,26
To save her life I'll say she is not so.,26
And only in that safety died her brothers.,26
No to their lives bad friends were contrary.,26
True when avoided grace makes destiny:,26
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.,26
Cousins indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd,26
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,26
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt,26
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.,26
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys,26
And I in such a desperate bay of death,26
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.,26
And dangerous success of bloody wars,26
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!,26
To be discover'd that can do me good?,26
Up to some scaffold there to lose their heads?,26
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.,26
Tell me what state what dignity what honour,26
Even all I have; yea and myself and all,26
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul,26
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.,26
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.,26
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.,26
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:,26
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.,26
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter,26
Say then who dost thou mean shall be her king?,26
What thou?,26
How canst thou woo her?,26
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.,26
Madam with all my heart.,26
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave,26
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret,26
A handkerchief; which say to her did drain,26
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.,26
Send her a story of thy noble acts;,26
Her uncle Rivers; yea and for her sake,26
Come come you mock me; this is not the way,26
There is no other way,26
And not be Richard that hath done all this.,26
Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,26
Look what is done cannot be now amended:,26
Which after hours give leisure to repent.,26
To make amends Ill give it to your daughter.,26
To quicken your increase I will beget,26
A grandam's name is little less in love,26
They are as children but one step below,26
Of an one pain save for a night of groans,26
Your children were vexation to your youth,26
The loss you have is but a son being king,26
I cannot make you what amends I would,26
Dorset your son that with a fearful soul,26
This fair alliance quickly shall call home,26
The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife.,26
Again shall you be mother to a king,26
Repair'd with double riches of content.,26
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed,26
Advantaging their loan with interest,26
Go then my mother to thy daughter go,26
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale,26
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess,26
And when this arm of mine hath chastised,26
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,26
To whom I will retail my conquest won,26
What were I best to say? her father's brother,26
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?,26
That God the law my honour and her love,26
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.,26
Say that the king which may command entreats.,26
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.,26
Say I will love her everlastingly.,26
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.,26
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.,26
Say I her sovereign am her subject love.,26
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.,26
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.,26
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.,26
Too deep and dead poor infants in their grave.,26
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.,26
Profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd.,26
By nothing; for this is no oath:,26
The garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue;,26
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,26
Now by the world--,26
My father's death--,26
Then by myself--,26
Why then by God--,26
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,26
Had not been broken nor my brother slain:,26
The imperial metal circling now thy brow,26
And both the princes had been breathing here,26
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.,26
The time to come.,26
For I myself have many tears to wash,26
The children live whose parents thou hast,26
Ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age;,26
Old wither'd plants to wail it with their age.,26
Misused ere used by time misused o'erpast.,26
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt,26
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!,26

And Richard falls in height of all his pride.,26
KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream,26
Have mercy Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.,26
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.,26

Lest I revenge. What myself upon myself?,26
That I myself have done unto myself?,26
For hateful deeds committed by myself!,26

And every tongue brings in a several tale,26
Perjury perjury in the high'st degree,26
All several sins all used in each degree,26
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;,26
Nay wherefore should they since that I myself,26
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd,26
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.,26

Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd,26

More than I have said loving countrymen,26
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,26
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,26
Richard except those whom we fight against,26
For what is he they follow?  truly gentlemen,26
One raised in blood and one in blood establish'd;,26
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;,26
Of England's chair where he is falsely set;,26
Then if you fight against God's enemy,26
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,26
If you do fight against your country's foes,26
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,26
If you do free your children from the sword,26
Then in the name of God and all these rights,26
For me the ransom of my bold attempt,26
But if I thrive the gain of my attempt,26
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;,26

What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?,26
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?,26
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.,26
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.,26
Not I my lord.,26
He should have braved the east an hour ago,26
My lord?,26
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.,26

A good direction warlike sovereign.,26
He sheweth him a paper,26
Jockey of Norfolk be not too bold,26
A thing devised by the enemy.,26
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:,26
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:,26
March on join bravely let us to't pell-mell,26
His oration to his Army,26
Remember whom you are to cope withal;,26
A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,26
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.,26
You having lands and blest with beauteous wives,26
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,26
A milk-sop one that never in his life,26
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;,26
These famish'd beggars weary of their lives;,26
For want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves:,26
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers,26
And in record left them the heirs of shame.,26
Ravish our daughters?,26
Hark! I hear their drum.,26
Draw archers draw your arrows to the head!,26
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!,26
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?,26

Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!,26
Exeunt,26
Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting; to him CATESBY,26
The king enacts more wonders than a man,26
His horse is slain and all on foot he fights,26
Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost!,26
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!,26
Slave I have set my life upon a cast,26
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;,26
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!,26
SCENE V. Another part of the field.,26
God and your arms be praised victorious friends,26
Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee.,26
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch,26
Wear it enjoy it and make much of it.,26
But tell me is young George Stanley living?,26
Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us.,26
John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers,26
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:,26
That in submission will return to us:,26
We will unite the white rose and the red:,26
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!,26
England hath long been mad and scarr'd herself;,26
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,26
All this divided York and Lancaster,26
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth,26
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!,26
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,26
Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord,26
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!,26
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!,26
That she may long live here God say amen!,26
ACT I,27
Two households both alike in dignity,27
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,27
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,27
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows,27
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,27
Which but their children's end nought could remove,27
The which if you with patient ears attend,27
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.,27
Gregory o' my word we'll not carry coals.,27
I mean an we be in choler we'll draw.,27
I strike quickly being moved.,27
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.,27
therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st away.,27
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.,27
to the wall.,27
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push,27
to the wall.,27
Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant: when I,27
maids and cut off their heads.,27
Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads;,27
They must take it in sense that feel it.,27
tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.,27
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes,27
My naked weapon is out: quarrel I will back thee.,27
Fear me not.,27
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.,27
they list.,27
which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.,27
Do you bite your thumb at us sir?,27
Do you bite your thumb at us sir?,27
ay?,27
No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I,27
Do you quarrel sir?,27
If you do sir I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.,27
Well sir.,27
Yes better sir.,27
Draw if you be men. Gregory remember thy swashing blow.,27
Enter BENVOLIO,27
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.,27
Enter TYBALT,27
Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death.,27
Or manage it to part these men with me.,27
As I hate hell all Montagues and thee:,27
They fight,27
Clubs bills and partisans! strike! beat them down!,27
Enter CAPULET in his gown and LADY CAPULET,27
A crutch a crutch! why call you for a sword?,27
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.,27
Thou villain Capulet--Hold me not let me go.,27
Enter PRINCE with Attendants,27
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel--,27
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage,27
On pain of torture from those bloody hands,27
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.,27
By thee old Capulet and Montague,27
And made Verona's ancient citizens,27
To wield old partisans in hands as old,27
If ever you disturb our streets again,27
For this time all the rest depart away:,27
And Montague come you this afternoon,27
To old Free-town our common judgment-place.,27
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE LADY MONTAGUE and BENVOLIO,27
Speak nephew were you by when it began?,27
And yours close fighting ere I did approach:,27
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,27
He swung about his head and cut the winds,27
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,27
Till the prince came who parted either part.,27
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.,27
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,27
Where underneath the grove of sycamore,27
So early walking did I see your son:,27
And stole into the covert of the wood:,27
That most are busied when they're most alone,27
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.,27
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.,27
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun,27
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,27
And private in his chamber pens himself,27
And makes himself an artificial night:,27
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.,27
I neither know it nor can learn of him.,27
Both by myself and many other friends:,27
Is to himself--I will not say how true--,27
So far from sounding and discovery,27
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,27
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.,27
Enter ROMEO,27
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.,27
To hear true shrift. Come madam let's away.,27
Good-morrow cousin.,27
But new struck nine.,27
Was that my father that went hence so fast?,27
Not having that which having makes them short.,27
Out--,27
Out of her favour where I am in love.,27
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!,27
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!,27
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all.,27
Why then O brawling love! O loving hate!,27
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!,27
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire,27
Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!,27
Dost thou not laugh?,27
Good heart at what?,27
Why such is love's transgression.,27
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest,27
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.,27
Being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;,27
What is it else? a madness most discreet,27
Farewell my coz.,27
An if you leave me so you do me wrong.,27
This is not Romeo he's some other where.,27
What shall I groan and tell thee?,27
But sadly tell me who.,27
Ah word ill urged to one that is so ill!,27
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.,27
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit.,27
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;,27
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.,27
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,27
O she is rich in beauty only poor,27
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?,27
For beauty starved with her severity,27
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair,27
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow,27
Be ruled by me forget to think of her.,27
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;,27
Tis the way,27
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,27
He that is strucken blind cannot forget,27
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,27
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?,27
I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.,27
SCENE II. A street.,27
But Montague is bound as well as I,27
For men so old as we to keep the peace.,27
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.,27
But saying o'er what I have said before:,27
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,27
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.,27
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.,27
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:,27
My will to her consent is but a part;,27
Lies my consent and fair according voice.,27
Whereto I have invited many a guest,27
One more most welcome makes my number more.,27
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:,27
When well-apparell'd April on the heel,27
Among fresh female buds shall you this night,27
And like her most whose merit most shall be:,27
May stand in number though in reckoning none,27
To Servant giving a paper,27
Through fair Verona; find those persons out,27
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.,27
Find them out whose names are written here! It is,27
yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with,27
sent to find those persons whose names are here,27
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.,27
Tut man one fire burns out another's burning,27
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning;,27
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,27
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.,27
For your broken shin.,27
Not mad but bound more than a mad-man is;,27
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den good fellow.,27
Ay mine own fortune in my misery.,27
pray can you read any thing you see?,27
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!,27
Reads,27
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady,27
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine,27
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin,27
assembly: whither should they come?,27
Whither?,27
Whose house?,27
Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.,27
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house,27
Rest you merry!,27
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's,27
With all the admired beauties of Verona:,27
Compare her face with some that I shall show,27
When the devout religion of mine eye,27
And these who often drown'd could never die,27
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun,27
Tut you saw her fair none else being by,27
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd,27
That I will show you shining at this feast,27
I'll go along no such sight to be shown,27
Exeunt,27
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse,27
Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old,27
God forbid! Where's this girl? What Juliet!,27
How now! who calls?,27
Madam I am here.,27
This is the matter:--Nurse give leave awhile,27
I have remember'd me thou's hear our counsel.,27
Faith I can tell her age unto an hour.,27
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth--,27
She is not fourteen. How long is it now,27
A fortnight and odd days.,27
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.,27
Were of an age: well Susan is with God;,27
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;,27
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;,27
Of all the days of the year upon that day:,27
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;,27
Nay I do bear a brain:--but as I said,27
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool,27
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need I trow,27
And since that time it is eleven years;,27
She could have run and waddled all about;,27
And then my husband--God be with his soul!,27
Yea' quoth he 'dost thou fall upon thy face?,27
Wilt thou not Jule?' and by my holidame,27
To see now how a jest shall come about!,27
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not Jule?' quoth he;,27
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.,27
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.',27
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;,27
Yea' quoth my husband'fall'st upon thy face?,27
Wilt thou not Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.',27
Peace I have done. God mark thee to his grace!,27
An I might live to see thee married once,27
Marry that 'marry' is the very theme,27
How stands your disposition to be married?,27
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,27
Well think of marriage now; younger than you,27
Are made already mothers: by my count,27
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:,27
A man young lady! lady such a man,27
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.,27
What say you? can you love the gentleman?,27
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,27
Examine every married lineament,27
And what obscured in this fair volume lies,27
This precious book of love this unbound lover,27
The fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride,27
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,27
So shall you share all that he doth possess,27
No less! nay bigger; women grow by men.,27
I'll look to like if looking liking move:,27
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.,27
Madam the guests are come supper served up you,27
the pantry and every thing in extremity. I must,27
We follow thee.,27
Juliet the county stays.,27
Exeunt,27
Enter ROMEO MERCUTIO BENVOLIO with five or six Maskers Torch-bearers and others,27
Or shall we on without a apology?,27
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,27
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;,27
After the prompter for our entrance:,27
We'll measure them a measure and be gone.,27
Being but heavy I will bear the light.,27
Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes,27
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.,27
And soar with them above a common bound.,27
To soar with his light feathers and so bound,27
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.,27
Too great oppression for a tender thing.,27
Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn.,27
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down.,27
A visor for a visor! what care I,27
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.,27
But every man betake him to his legs.,27
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,27
I'll be a candle-holder and look on.,27
Tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word:,27
Of this sir-reverence love wherein thou stick'st,27
Nay that's not so.,27
We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day.,27
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.,27
But 'tis no wit to go.,27
I dream'd a dream to-night.,27
Well what was yours?,27
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.,27
She is the fairies' midwife and she comes,27
On the fore-finger of an alderman,27
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;,27
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,27
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,27
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,27
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;,27
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,27
And in this state she gallops night by night,27
O'er courtiers' knees that dream on court'sies straight,27
O'er ladies ' lips who straight on kisses dream,27
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:,27
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;,27
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,27
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,27
Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades,27
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes,27
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab,27
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,27
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs,27
Making them women of good carriage:,27
Peace peace Mercutio peace!,27
True I talk of dreams,27
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,27
And more inconstant than the wind who wooes,27
And being anger'd puffs away from thence,27
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves;,27
I fear too early: for my mind misgives,27
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date,27
Of a despised life closed in my breast,27
But He that hath the steerage of my course,27
Strike drum.,27
SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.,27
Where's Potpan that he helps not to take away? He,27
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's,27
Away with the joint-stools remove the,27
me a piece of marchpane; and as thou lovest me let,27
Antony and Potpan!,27
You are looked for and called for asked for and,27
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly boys; be,27
Enter CAPULET with JULIET and others of his house meeting the Guests and Maskers,27
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.,27
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,27
Welcome gentlemen! I have seen the day,27
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,27
You are welcome gentlemen! come musicians play.,27
Music plays and they dance,27
And quench the fire the room is grown too hot.,27
Nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet;,27
How long is't now since last yourself and I,27
By'r lady thirty years.,27
Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,27
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.,27
His son is thirty.,27
His son was but a ward two years ago.,27
enrich the hand,27
I know not sir.,27
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night,27
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear!,27
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.,27
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand.,27
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.,27
Fetch me my rapier boy. What dares the slave,27
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?,27
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.,27
Uncle this is a Montague our foe,27
To scorn at our solemnity this night.,27
Tis he that villain Romeo.,27
He bears him like a portly gentleman;,27
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:,27
Here in my house do him disparagement:,27
It is my will the which if thou respect,27
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.,27
I'll not endure him.,27
What goodman boy! I say he shall: go to;,27
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!,27
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!,27
Go to go to;,27
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what:,27
Well said my hearts! You are a princox; go:,27
I'll make you quiet. What cheerly my hearts!,27
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.,27
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.,27
[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand,27
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand,27
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much,27
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,27
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too?,27
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do;,27
Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake.,27
Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged.,27
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!,27
You kiss by the book.,27
What is her mother?,27
Her mother is the lady of the house,27
I nursed her daughter that you talk'd withal;,27
Shall have the chinks.,27
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.,27
Ay so I fear; the more is my unrest.,27
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.,27
I thank you honest gentlemen; good night.,27
Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late:,27
Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse,27
The son and heir of old Tiberio.,27
Marry that I think be young Petrucio.,27
I know not.,27
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.,27
The only son of your great enemy.,27
Too early seen unknown and known too late!,27
That I must love a loathed enemy.,27
A rhyme I learn'd even now,27
One calls within 'Juliet.',27
Come let's away; the strangers all are gone.,27
ACT II,27
Enter Chorus,27
And young affection gapes to be his heir;,27
With tender Juliet match'd is now not fair.,27
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,27
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:,27
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;,27
To meet her new-beloved any where:,27
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.,27
SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.,27
Can I go forward when my heart is here?,27
He climbs the wall and leaps down within it,27
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!,27
And on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed.,27
Call good Mercutio.,27
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!,27
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied;,27
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,27
Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim,27
He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not;,27
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,27
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh,27
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!,27
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him,27
Of some strange nature letting it there stand,27
That were some spite: my invocation,27
I conjure only but to raise up him.,27
To be consorted with the humorous night:,27
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark.,27
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit,27
Romeo that she were O that she were,27
Romeo good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;,27
Come shall we go?,27
To seek him here that means not to be found.,27
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.,27
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.,27
But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?,27
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,27
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:,27
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,27
It is my lady O it is my love!,27
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?,27
I am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks:,27
Having some business do entreat her eyes,27
What if her eyes were there they in her head?,27
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven,27
That birds would sing and think it were not night.,27
O that I were a glove upon that hand,27
Ay me!,27
O speak again bright angel! for thou art,27
As is a winged messenger of heaven,27
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him,27
And sails upon the bosom of the air.,27
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;,27
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.,27
Tis but thy name that is my enemy;,27
What's Montague? it is nor hand nor foot,27
Belonging to a man. O be some other name!,27
By any other name would smell as sweet;,27
Retain that dear perfection which he owes,27
And for that name which is no part of thee,27
I take thee at thy word:,27
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.,27
So stumblest on my counsel?,27
I know not how to tell thee who I am:,27
Because it is an enemy to thee;,27
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words,27
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?,27
How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore?,27
And the place death considering who thou art,27
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;,27
And what love can do that dares love attempt;,27
If they do see thee they will murder thee.,27
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,27
I would not for the world they saw thee here.,27
And but thou love me let them find me here:,27
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love.,27
By love who first did prompt me to inquire;,27
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far,27
I would adventure for such merchandise.,27
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek,27
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny,27
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay',27
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,27
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully:,27
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,27
In truth fair Montague I am too fond,27
But trust me gentleman I'll prove more true,27
I should have been more strange I must confess,27
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,27
Which the dark night hath so discovered.,27
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--,27
That monthly changes in her circled orb,27
What shall I swear by?,27
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self,27
And I'll believe thee.,27
Well do not swear: although I joy in thee,27
It is too rash too unadvised too sudden;,27
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet good night!,27
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.,27
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!,27
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?,27
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:,27
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose love?,27
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:,27
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,27
Nurse calls within,27
Anon good nurse! Sweet Montague be true.,27
Exit above,27
Being in night all this is but a dream,27
Re-enter JULIET above,27
If that thy bent of love be honourable,27
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,27
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay,27
[Within]  Madam!,27
I do beseech thee--,27
By and by I come:--,27
To-morrow will I send.,27
A thousand times good night!,27
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.,27
their books,27
Retiring,27
Hist! Romeo hist! O for a falconer's voice,27
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;,27
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,27
It is my soul that calls upon my name:,27
Like softest music to attending ears!,27
My dear?,27
Shall I send to thee?,27
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.,27
Let me stand here till thou remember it.,27
Remembering how I love thy company.,27
Forgetting any other home but this.,27
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;,27
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,27
So loving-jealous of his liberty.,27
Sweet so would I:,27
Good night good night! parting is such,27
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.,27
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast!,27
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,27
Exit,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE with a basket,27
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,27
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:,27
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,27
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.,27
What is her burying grave that is her womb,27
We sucking on her natural bosom find,27
None but for some and yet all different.,27
In herbs plants stones and their true qualities:,27
But to the earth some special good doth give,27
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse:,27
And vice sometimes by action dignified.,27
Poison hath residence and medicine power:,27
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart.,27
In man as well as herbs grace and rude will;,27
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.,27
Good morrow father.,27
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?,27
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:,27
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;,27
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign:,27
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;,27
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.,27
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?,27
I have forgot that name and that name's woe.,27
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.,27
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,27
Within thy help and holy physic lies:,27
My intercession likewise steads my foe.,27
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.,27
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:,27
And all combined save what thou must combine,27
We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow,27
That thou consent to marry us to-day.,27
Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear,27
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.,27
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!,27
To season love that of it doth not taste!,27
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;,27
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:,27
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:,27
Women may fall when there's no strength in men.,27
For doting not for loving pupil mine.,27
Not in a grave,27
I pray thee chide not; she whom I love now,27
The other did not so.,27
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.,27
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;,27
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.,27
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.,27
SCENE IV. A street.,27
Where the devil should this Romeo be?,27
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.,27
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.,27
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.,27
Romeo will answer it.,27
Nay he will answer the letter's master how he,27
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a,27
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the,27
encounter Tybalt?,27
More than prince of cats I can tell you. O he is,27
you sing prick-song keeps time distance and,27
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk,27
very first house of the first and second cause:,27
hai!,27
The pox of such antic lisping affecting,27
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good,27
grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with,27
perdona-mi's who stand so much on the new form,27
bones their bones!,27
Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo.,27
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers,27
kitchen-wench; marry she had a better love to,27
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey,27
Romeo bon jour! there's a French salutation,27
fairly last night.,27
The ship sir the slip; can you not conceive?,27
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.,27
constrains a man to bow in the hams.,27
Thou hast most kindly hit it.,27
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.,27
Right.,27
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast,27
is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.,27
singleness.,27
Switch and spurs switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.,27
done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of,27
was I with you there for the goose?,27
not there for the goose.,27
Nay good goose bite not.,27
sharp sauce.,27
O here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an,27
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added,27
Why is not this better now than groaning for love?,27
thou what thou art by art as well as by nature:,27
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.,27
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.,27
O thou art deceived; I would have made it short:,27
meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.,27
Enter Nurse and PETER,27
Two two; a shirt and a smock.,27
Anon!,27
Good Peter to hide her face; for her fan's the,27
God ye good morrow gentlemen.,27
Is it good den?,27
dial is now upon the prick of noon.,27
One gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to,27
By my troth it is well said; 'for himself to mar',27
may find the young Romeo?,27
you have found him than he was when you sought him:,27
You say well.,27
wisely wisely.,27
you.,27
A bawd a bawd a bawd! so ho!,27
No hare sir; unless a hare sir in a lenten pie,27
Sings,27
And an old hare hoar,27
But a hare that is hoar,27
When it hoars ere it be spent.,27
to dinner thither.,27
Farewell ancient lady; farewell,27
lady lady lady.',27
Marry farewell! I pray you sir what saucy,27
A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk,27
to in a month.,27
down an a' were lustier than he is and twenty such,27
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am,27
too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?,27
should quickly have been out I warrant you: I dare,27
good quarrel and the law on my side.,27
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you sir a word:,27
out; what she bade me say I will keep to myself:,27
a fool's paradise as they say it were a very gross,27
is young; and therefore if you should deal double,27
to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing.,27
protest unto thee--,27
Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman.,27
I will tell her sir that you do protest; which as,27
Bid her devise,27
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell,27
No truly sir; not a penny.,27
This afternoon sir? well she shall be there.,27
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,27
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy,27
Farewell; be trusty and I'll quit thy pains:,27
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you sir.,27
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,27
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.,27
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O there,27
lay knife aboard; but she good soul had as lief,27
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer,27
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not,27
Ay nurse; what of that? both with an R.,27
the--No; I know it begins with some other,27
it of you and rosemary that it would do you good,27
Commend me to thy lady.,27
Exit Romeo,27
Anon!,27
Exeunt,27
Enter JULIET,27
In half an hour she promised to return.,27
O she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,27
Driving back shadows over louring hills:,27
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.,27
Of this day's journey and from nine till twelve,27
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,27
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,27
But old folks many feign as they were dead;,27
O God she comes!,27
O honey nurse what news?,27
Peter stay at the gate.,27
Now good sweet nurse--O Lord why look'st thou sad?,27
If good thou shamest the music of sweet news,27
I am a-weary give me leave awhile:,27
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news:,27
Jesu what haste? can you not stay awhile?,27
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath,27
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay,27
Is thy news good or bad? answer to that;,27
Let me be satisfied is't good or bad?,27
how to choose a man: Romeo! no not he; though his,27
all men's; and for a hand and a foot and a body,27
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,27
ways wench; serve God. What have you dined at home?,27
What says he of our marriage? what of that?,27
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.,27
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,27
I' faith I am sorry that thou art not well.,27
Your love says like an honest gentleman and a,27
warrant a virtuous--Where is your mother?,27
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!,27
Where is your mother?',27
Are you so hot? marry come up I trow;,27
Henceforward do your messages yourself.,27
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?,27
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;,27
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,27
Hie you to church; I must another way,27
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:,27
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.,27
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse farewell.,27
SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.,27
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,27
Amen amen! but come what sorrow can,27
That one short minute gives me in her sight:,27
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;,27
These violent delights have violent ends,27
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey,27
And in the taste confounds the appetite:,27
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.,27
Here comes the lady: O so light a foot,27
A lover may bestride the gossamer,27
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.,27
Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both.,27
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy,27
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath,27
Unfold the imagined happiness that both,27
Conceit more rich in matter than in words,27
They are but beggars that can count their worth;,27
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.,27
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone,27
Exeunt,27
SCENE I. A public place.,27
I pray thee good Mercutio let's retire:,27
And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl;,27
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he,27
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of,27
it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.,27
Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as,27
soon moody to be moved.,27
Nay an there were two such we should have none,27
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,27
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no,27
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?,27
meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as,27
man for coughing in the street because he hath,27
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing,27
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou,27
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man,27
The fee-simple! O simple!,27
By my heel I care not.,27
Follow me close for I will speak to them.,27
And but one word with one of us? couple it with,27
You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you,27
Could you not take some occasion without giving?,27
Consort! what dost thou make us minstrels? an,27
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall,27
We talk here in the public haunt of men:,27
And reason coldly of your grievances,27
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze;,27
Enter ROMEO,27
But I'll be hanged sir if he wear your livery:,27
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.',27
No better term than this--thou art a villain.,27
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage,27
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.,27
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.,27
But love thee better than thou canst devise,27
And so good Capulet--which name I tender,27
O calm dishonourable vile submission!,27
Draws,27
What wouldst thou have with me?,27
lives; that I mean to make bold withal and as you,27
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher,27
ears ere it be out.,27
Drawing,27
Come sir your passado.,27
Draw Benvolio; beat down their weapons.,27
Tybalt Mercutio the prince expressly hath,27
Hold Tybalt! good Mercutio!,27
I am hurt.,27
Is he gone and hath nothing?,27
Ay ay a scratch a scratch; marry 'tis enough.,27
Exit Page,27
No 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a,27
me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man. I,27
both your houses! 'Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a,27
rogue a villain that fights by the book of,27
was hurt under your arm.,27
Help me into some house Benvolio,27
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,27
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO,27
My very friend hath got his mortal hurt,27
With Tybalt's slander--Tybalt that an hour,27
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,27
Re-enter BENVOLIO,27
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,27
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;,27
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.,27
Away to heaven respective lenity,27
Re-enter TYBALT,27
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul,27
Staying for thine to keep him company:,27
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here,27
This shall determine that.,27
Romeo away be gone!,27
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,27
O I am fortune's fool!,27
Exit ROMEO,27
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?,27
There lies that Tybalt.,27
I charge thee in the princes name obey.,27
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?,27
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:,27
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.,27
O prince! O cousin! husband! O the blood is spilt,27
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.,27
Benvolio who began this bloody fray?,27
Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink,27
Your high displeasure: all this uttered,27
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen,27
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,27
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats,27
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity,27
Hold friends! friends part!' and swifter than,27
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,27
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life,27
But by and by comes back to Romeo,27
And to 't they go like lightning for ere I,27
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.,27
He is a kinsman to the Montague;,27
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,27
I beg for justice which thou prince must give;,27
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio;,27
Not Romeo prince he was Mercutio's friend;,27
The life of Tybalt.,27
Immediately we do exile him hence:,27
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;,27
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:,27
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:,27
Else when he's found that hour is his last.,27
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill.,27
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.,27
Gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds,27
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,27
Spread thy close curtain love-performing night,27
Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.,27
By their own beauties; or if love be blind,27
Thou sober-suited matron all in black,27
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:,27
With thy black mantle; till strange love grown bold,27
Come night; come Romeo; come thou day in night;,27
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.,27
Give me my Romeo; and when he shall die,27
And he will make the face of heaven so fine,27
And pay no worship to the garish sun.,27
But not possess'd it and though I am sold,27
As is the night before some festival,27
And may not wear them. O here comes my nurse,27
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.,27
Now nurse what news? What hast thou there? the cords,27
Ay ay the cords.,27
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?,27
We are undone lady we are undone!,27
Can heaven be so envious?,27
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo Romeo!,27
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?,27
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I',27
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:,27
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.',27
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.,27
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:,27
Pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood,27
O break my heart! poor bankrupt break at once!,27
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here;,27
O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had!,27
That ever I should live to see thee dead!,27
Is Romeo slaughter'd and is Tybalt dead?,27
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom!,27
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished;,27
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?,27
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!,27
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!,27
Despised substance of divinest show!,27
A damned saint an honourable villain!,27
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend,27
Was ever book containing such vile matter,27
In such a gorgeous palace!,27
No faith no honesty in men; all perjured,27
Ah where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:,27
Shame come to Romeo!,27
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:,27
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd,27
O what a beast was I to chide at him!,27
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?,27
When I thy three-hours wife have mangled it?,27
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:,27
Your tributary drops belong to woe,27
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain;,27
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?,27
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;,27
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:,27
That 'banished' that one word 'banished',27
Was woe enough if it had ended there:,27
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,27
Thy father or thy mother nay or both,27
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,27
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet,27
There is no end no limit measure bound,27
Where is my father and my mother nurse?,27
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.,27
When theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment.,27
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:,27
But I a maid die maiden-widowed.,27
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead!,27
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.,27
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.,27
And bid him come to take his last farewell.,27
SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.,27
Romeo come forth; come forth thou fearful man:,27
And thou art wedded to calamity.,27
Father what news? what is the prince's doom?,27
That I yet know not?,27
Is my dear son with such sour company:,27
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?,27
Not body's death but body's banishment.,27
For exile hath more terror in his look,27
Hence from Verona art thou banished:,27
There is no world without Verona walls,27
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,27
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,27
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.,27
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,27
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:,27
Tis torture and not mercy: heaven is here,27
And little mouse every unworthy thing,27
But Romeo may not: more validity,27
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize,27
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,27
Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin;,27
Flies may do this but I from this must fly:,27
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?,27
No sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean,27
O friar the damned use that word in hell;,27
Being a divine a ghostly confessor,27
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?,27
O thou wilt speak again of banishment.,27
Adversity's sweet milk philosophy,27
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!,27
Displant a town reverse a prince's doom,27
O then I see that madmen have no ears.,27
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.,27
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love,27
Doting like me and like me banished,27
And fall upon the ground as I do now,27
Knocking within,27
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,27
Knocking,27
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;,27
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,27
Knocking,27
[Within]  Let me come in and you shall know,27
I come from Lady Juliet.,27
Enter Nurse,27
Where is my lady's lord where's Romeo?,27
O he is even in my mistress' case,27
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,27
Stand up stand up; stand and you be a man:,27
Why should you fall into so deep an O?,27
Ah sir! ah sir! Well death's the end of all.,27
Doth she not think me an old murderer,27
With blood removed but little from her own?,27
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?,27
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,27
And then down falls again.,27
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,27
Murder'd her kinsman. O tell me friar tell me,27
Doth my name lodge? tell me that I may sack,27
Drawing his sword,27
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:,27
The unreasonable fury of a beast:,27
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!,27
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.,27
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,27
Why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth?,27
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.,27
Which like a usurer abound'st in all,27
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit:,27
Digressing from the valour of a man;,27
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;,27
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,27
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,27
What rouse thee man! thy Juliet is alive,27
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,27
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend,27
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;,27
But like a misbehaved and sullen wench,27
Take heed take heed for such die miserable.,27
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her:,27
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;,27
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends,27
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy,27
Go before nurse: commend me to thy lady;,27
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:,27
O Lord I could have stay'd here all the night,27
My lord I'll tell my lady you will come.,27
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir:,27
Exit,27
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:,27
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:,27
And he shall signify from time to time,27
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.,27
It were a grief so brief to part with thee: Farewell.,27
SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.,27
Things have fall'n out sir so unluckily,27
Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,27
Tis very late she'll not come down to-night:,27
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.,27
Madam good night: commend me to your daughter.,27
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.,27
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled,27
Wife go you to her ere you go to bed;,27
And bid her mark you me on Wednesday next--,27
Monday my lord,27
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday tell her,27
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?,27
For hark you Tybalt being slain so late,27
Being our kinsman if we revel much:,27
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?,27
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it then.,27
Prepare her wife against this wedding-day.,27
Afore me! it is so very very late,27
Good night.,27
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.,27
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:,27
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;,27
Believe me love it was the nightingale.,27
No nightingale: look love what envious streaks,27
Night's candles are burnt out and jocund day,27
I must be gone and live or stay and die.,27
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,27
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:,27
Let me be ta'en let me be put to death;,27
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,27
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat,27
I have more care to stay than will to go:,27
How is't my soul? let's talk; it is not day.,27
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,27
Some say the lark makes sweet division;,27
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,27
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,27
O now be gone; more light and light it grows.,27
Enter Nurse to the chamber,27
Nurse?,27
The day is broke; be wary look about.,27
Then window let day in and let life out.,27
He goeth down,27
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,27
O by this count I shall be much in years,27
Farewell!,27
That may convey my greetings love to thee.,27
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve,27
O God I have an ill-divining soul!,27
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:,27
And trust me love in my eye so do you:,27
Exit,27
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him.,27
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,27
[Within]         Ho daughter! are you up?,27
Is she not down so late or up so early?,27
Enter LADY CAPULET,27
Madam I am not well.,27
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?,27
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;,27
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.,27
Which you weep for.,27
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.,27
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.,27
That same villain Romeo.,27
God Pardon him! I do with all my heart;,27
That is because the traitor murderer lives.,27
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!,27
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,27
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,27
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.,27
With Romeo till I behold him--dead--,27
Madam if you could find out but a man,27
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,27
To hear him named and cannot come to him.,27
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!,27
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings girl.,27
What are they I beseech your ladyship?,27
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,27
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.,27
Marry my child early next Thursday morn,27
The County Paris at Saint Peter's Church,27
Now by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,27
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed,27
I pray you tell my lord and father madam,27
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate,27
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,27
Enter CAPULET and Nurse,27
But for the sunset of my brother's son,27
How now! a conduit girl? what still in tears?,27
Thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind;,27
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,27
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,27
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now wife!,27
Ay sir; but she will none she gives you thanks.,27
Soft! take me with you take me with you wife.,27
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,27
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?,27
Proud can I never be of what I hate;,27
How now how now chop-logic! What is this?,27
And yet 'not proud' mistress minion you,27
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,27
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.,27
You tallow-face!,27
Good father I beseech you on my knees,27
Hang thee young baggage! disobedient wretch!,27
Or never after look me in the face:,27
My fingers itch. Wife we scarce thought us blest,27
But now I see this one is one too much,27
Out on her hilding!,27
You are to blame my lord to rate her so.,27
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips go.,27
O God ye god-den.,27
Peace you mumbling fool!,27
For here we need it not.,27
God's bread! it makes me mad:,27
Alone in company still my care hath been,27
A gentleman of noble parentage,27
Stuff'd as they say with honourable parts,27
And then to have a wretched puling fool,27
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,27
But as you will not wed I'll pardon you:,27
Look to't think on't I do not use to jest.,27
An you be mine I'll give you to my friend;,27
the streets,27
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:,27
Exit,27
That sees into the bottom of my grief?,27
Delay this marriage for a month a week;,27
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.,27
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.,27
O God!--O nurse how shall this be prevented?,27
How shall that faith return again to earth,27
By leaving earth? comfort me counsel me.,27
Upon so soft a subject as myself!,27
Some comfort nurse.,27
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,27
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth.,27
I think it best you married with the county.,27
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle madam,27
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,27
For it excels your first: or if it did not,27
As living here and you no use of him.,27
And from my soul too;,27
Amen!,27
Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much.,27
Having displeased my father to Laurence' cell,27
Marry I will; and this is wisely done.,27
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!,27
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue,27
So many thousand times? Go counsellor;,27
I'll to the friar to know his remedy:,27
Exit,27
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.,27
On Thursday sir? the time is very short.,27
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.,27
Uneven is the course I like it not.,27
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;,27
Now sir her father counts it dangerous,27
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,27
Which too much minded by herself alone,27
Now do you know the reason of this haste.,27
Look sir here comes the lady towards my cell.,27
Happily met my lady and my wife!,27
That may be must be love on Thursday next.,27
That's a certain text.,27
To answer that I should confess to you.,27
I will confess to you that I love him.,27
If I do so it will be of more price,27
Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears.,27
For it was bad enough before their spite.,27
That is no slander sir which is a truth;,27
Thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it.,27
Are you at leisure holy father now;,27
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now.,27
God shield I should disturb devotion!,27
Till then adieu; and keep this holy kiss.,27
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,27
Ah Juliet I already know thy grief;,27
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it,27
Tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this,27
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,27
And with this knife I'll help it presently.,27
And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd,27
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt,27
Therefore out of thy long-experienced time,27
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife,27
Which the commission of thy years and art,27
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,27
Hold daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,27
As that is desperate which we would prevent.,27
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,27
A thing like death to chide away this shame,27
And if thou darest I'll give thee remedy.,27
From off the battlements of yonder tower;,27
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;,27
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,27
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,27
Things that to hear them told have made me tremble;,27
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.,27
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:,27
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:,27
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;,27
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse,27
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest;,27
To paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall,27
Each part deprived of supple government,27
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death,27
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.,27
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead:,27
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier,27
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.,27
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,27
Will watch thy waking and that very night,27
And this shall free thee from this present shame;,27
Abate thy valour in the acting it.,27
Hold; get you gone be strong and prosperous,27
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.,27
Farewell dear father!,27
SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.,27
So many guests invite as here are writ.,27
Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks.,27
can lick their fingers.,27
Marry sir 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his,27
fingers goes not with me.,27
Exit Second Servant,27
What is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?,27
Well he may chance to do some good on her:,27
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.,27
How now my headstrong! where have you been gadding?,27
Of disobedient opposition,27
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,27
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.,27
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.,27
And gave him what becomed love I might,27
Why I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:,27
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither.,27
Our whole city is much bound to him.,27
To help me sort such needful ornaments,27
No not till Thursday; there is time enough.,27
Exeunt JULIET and Nurse,27
Tis now near night.,27
And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife:,27
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;,27
They are all forth. Well I will walk myself,27
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,27
Exeunt,27
Enter JULIET and Nurse,27
I pray thee leave me to my self to-night,27
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,27
Enter LADY CAPULET,27
No madam; we have cull'd such necessaries,27
So please you let me now be left alone,27
For I am sure you have your hands full all,27
Good night:,27
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse,27
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,27
I'll call them back again to comfort me:,27
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.,27
What if this mixture do not work at all?,27
No no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.,27
What if it be a poison which the friar,27
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,27
I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not,27
How if when I am laid into the tomb,27
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!,27
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,27
Or if I live is it not very like,27
Together with the terror of the place--,27
Where for these many hundred years the bones,27
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth,27
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--,27
So early waking what with loathsome smells,27
That living mortals hearing them run mad:--,27
Environed with all these hideous fears?,27
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?,27
As with a club dash out my desperate brains?,27
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body,27
Romeo I come! this do I drink to thee.,27
SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.,27
Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse.,27
Enter CAPULET,27

Ha! let me see her: out alas! she's cold:,27
Life and these lips have long been separated:,27
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.,27

Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.,27
Come is the bride ready to go to church?,27
O son! the night before thy wedding-day,27

My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,27
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,27
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day!,27
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!,27
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,27
O woe! O woful woful woful day!,27
That ever ever I did yet behold!,27
Never was seen so black a day as this:,27

Despised distressed hated martyr'd kill'd!,27
To murder murder our solemnity?,27
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;,27
Peace ho for shame! confusion's cure lives not,27
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,27
Your part in her you could not keep from death,27
The most you sought was her promotion;,27
And weep ye now seeing she is advanced,27
O in this love you love your child so ill,27
She's not well married that lives married long;,27
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary,27
In all her best array bear her to church:,27
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.,27
Turn from their office to black funeral;,27
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,27
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,27
Sir go you in; and madam go with him;,27
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:,27
Move them no more by crossing their high will.,27
Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone.,27
For well you know this is a pitiful case.,27
Ay by my troth the case may be amended.,27
Musicians O musicians 'Heart's ease Heart's,27

ACT V,27
Enter ROMEO,27
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:,27
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit,27
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--,27
to think!--,27
That I revived and was an emperor.,27
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!,27
News from Verona!--How now Balthasar!,27
How doth my lady? Is my father well?,27
For nothing can be ill if she be well.,27
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,27
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,27
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,27
Is it even so? then I defy you stars!,27
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.,27
Your looks are pale and wild and do import,27
Tush thou art deceived:,27
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?,27
No matter: get thee gone,27
Exit BALTHASAR,27
Let's see for means: O mischief thou art swift,27
I do remember an apothecary--,27
In tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows,27
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:,27
An alligator stuff'd and other skins,27
A beggarly account of empty boxes,27
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,27
Noting this penury to myself I said,27
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,27
O this same thought did but forerun my need;,27
As I remember this should be the house.,27
What ho! apothecary!,27
Who calls so loud?,27
Hold there is forty ducats: let me have,27
As will disperse itself through all the veins,27
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath,27
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.,27
Is death to any he that utters them.,27
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,27
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;,27
The world affords no law to make thee rich;,27
My poverty but not my will consents.,27
Put this in any liquid thing you will,27
Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.,27
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,27
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.,27
Come cordial and not poison go with me,27
Exeunt,27
Enter FRIAR JOHN,27
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE,27
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?,27
Going to find a bare-foot brother out,27
Here in this city visiting the sick,27
Suspecting that we both were in a house,27
Seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth;,27
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?,27
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,27
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,27
Of dear import and the neglecting it,27
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight,27
Brother I'll go and bring it thee.,27
Now must I to the monument alone;,27
She will beshrew me much that Romeo,27
But I will write again to Mantua,27
Poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb!,27
SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.,27
Give me thy torch boy: hence and stand aloof:,27
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,27
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,27
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,27
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee go.,27
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.,27
Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew--,27
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,27
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,27
The Page whistles,27
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,27
What with a torch! muffle me night awhile.,27
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR with a torch mattock  and c,27
Hold take this letter; early in the morning,27
Give me the light: upon thy life I charge thee,27
And do not interrupt me in my course.,27
Is partly to behold my lady's face;,27
A precious ring a ring that I must use,27
But if thou jealous dost return to pry,27
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,27
The time and my intents are savage-wild,27
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.,27
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:,27
[Aside]  For all this same I'll hide me hereabout:,27
Retires,27
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,27
And in despite I'll cram thee with more food!,27
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,27
It is supposed the fair creature died;,27
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.,27
Stop thy unhallow'd toil vile Montague!,27
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee:,27
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.,27
Fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone;,27
Put not another sin upon my head,27
By heaven I love thee better than myself;,27
Stay not be gone; live and hereafter say,27
I do defy thy conjurations,27
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee boy!,27
O Lord they fight! I will go call the watch.,27
O I am slain!,27
If thou be merciful,27
Dies,27
Mercutio's kinsman noble County Paris!,27
Did not attend him as we rode? I think,27
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?,27
To think it was so? O give me thy hand,27
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;,27
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes,27
Death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd.,27
How oft when men are at the point of death,27
A lightning before death: O how may I,27
Death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,27
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet,27
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.,27
O what more favour can I do to thee,27
To sunder his that was thine enemy?,27
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe,27
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps,27
For fear of that I still will stay with thee;,27
Depart again: here here will I remain,27
Will I set up my everlasting rest,27
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes look your last!,27
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss,27
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide!,27
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!,27
Drinks,27
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.,27
Enter at the other end of the churchyard FRIAR LAURENCE with a lantern crow and spade,27
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?,27
Bliss be upon you! Tell me good my friend,27
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,27
It doth so holy sir; and there's my master,27
Who is it?,27
How long hath he been there?,27
Go with me to the vault.,27
My master knows not but I am gone hence;,27
If I did stay to look on his intents.,27
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing.,27
I dreamt my master and another fought,27
Romeo!,27
Alack alack what blood is this which stains,27
What mean these masterless and gory swords,27
Enters the tomb,27
And steep'd in blood? Ah what an unkind hour,27
The lady stirs.,27
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?,27
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?,27
I hear some noise. Lady come from that nest,27
A greater power than we can contradict,27
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;,27
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:,27
Come go good Juliet,27
I dare no longer stay.,27
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE,27
Poison I see hath been his timeless end:,27
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;,27
To make die with a restorative.,27
Thy lips are warm.,27
Yea noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!,27
This is thy sheath;,27
there rust and let me die.,27
Enter Watch with the Page of PARIS,27
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:,27
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,27
Who here hath lain these two days buried.,27
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:,27
But the true ground of all these piteous woes,27
Re-enter some of the Watch with BALTHASAR,27
Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.,27
Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps:,27
As he was coming from this churchyard side.,27
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants,27
That calls our person from our morning's rest?,27
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?,27
Some Juliet and some Paris; and all run,27
What fear is this which startles in our ears?,27
And Romeo dead; and Juliet dead before,27
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes.,27
With instruments upon them fit to open,27
O heavens! O wife look how our daughter bleeds!,27
Is empty on the back of Montague--,27
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,27
Enter MONTAGUE and others,27
To see thy son and heir more early down.,27
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:,27
Look and thou shalt see.,27
To press before thy father to a grave?,27
Till we can clear these ambiguities,27
true descent;,27
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,27
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.,27
Yet most suspected as the time and place,27
And here I stand both to impeach and purge,27
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.,27
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.,27
And she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife:,27
Was Tybalt's dooms-day whose untimely death,27
For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined.,27
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce,27
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean,27
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.,27
A sleeping potion; which so took effect,27
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,27
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,27
But he which bore my letter Friar John,27
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone,27
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;,27
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:,27
Of her awaking here untimely lay,27
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,27
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;,27
But as it seems did violence on herself.,27
Her nurse is privy: and if aught in this,27
Be sacrificed some hour before his time,27
We still have known thee for a holy man.,27
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;,27
To this same place to this same monument.,27
And threatened me with death going in the vault,27
Give me the letter; I will look on it.,27
Sirrah what made your master in this place?,27
And bid me stand aloof and so I did:,27
And by and by my master drew on him;,27
This letter doth make good the friar's words,27
And here he writes that he did buy a poison,27
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.,27
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,27
And I for winking at your discords too,27
O brother Montague give me thy hand:,27
Can I demand.,27
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;,27
There shall no figure at such rate be set,27
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;,27
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;,27
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;,27
For never was a story of more woe,27
Exeunt,27
Enter Hostess and SLY,28
A pair of stocks you rogue!,28
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.,28
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?,28
bed and warm thee.,28
third--borough.,28
Third or fourth or fifth borough I'll answer him,28
and kindly.,28
Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting with his train,28
Brach Merriman the poor cur is emboss'd;,28
Saw'st thou not boy how Silver made it good,28
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.,28
He cried upon it at the merest loss,28
Trust me I take him for the better dog.,28
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.,28
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.,28
What's here? one dead or drunk? See doth he breathe?,28
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.,28
Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image!,28
What think you if he were convey'd to bed,28
A most delicious banquet by his bed,28
Would not the beggar then forget himself?,28
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.,28
Then take him up and manage well the jest:,28
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:,28
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:,28
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;,28
And with a low submissive reverence,28
Let one attend him with a silver basin,28
Another bear the ewer the third a diaper,28
Some one be ready with a costly suit,28
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,28
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;,28
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.,28
It will be pastime passing excellent,28
My lord I warrant you we will play our part,28
He is no less than what we say he is.,28
And each one to his office when he wakes.,28
Sirrah go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:,28
Belike some noble gentleman that means,28
Re-enter Servingman,28
An't please your honour players,28
Bid them come near.,28
Now fellows you are welcome.,28
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?,28
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,28
Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:,28
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.,28
Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.,28
The rather for I have some sport in hand,28
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:,28
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior--,28
You break into some merry passion,28
If you should smile he grows impatient.,28
Were he the veriest antic in the world.,28
And give them friendly welcome every one:,28
Exit one with the Players,28
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:,28
And call him 'madam' do him obeisance.,28
He bear himself with honourable action,28
Unto their lords by them accomplished:,28
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,28
Wherein your lady and your humble wife,28
And then with kind embracements tempting kisses,28
Bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd,28
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him,28
And if the boy have not a woman's gift,28
An onion will do well for such a shift,28
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.,28
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.,28
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,28
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,28
When they do homage to this simple peasant.,28
May well abate the over-merry spleen,28
Exeunt,28
Enter aloft SLY with Attendants; some with apparel others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord,28
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?,28
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?,28
lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if,28
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I,28
than legs nor no more shoes than feet; nay,28
toes look through the over-leather.,28
O that a mighty man of such descent,28
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!,28
Sly old Sly's son of Burtonheath by birth a,28
bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker?,28
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence,28
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not,28
O this it is that makes your lady mourn!,28
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,28
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth,28
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.,28
Each in his office ready at thy beck.,28
Music,28
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch,28
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.,28
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,28
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar,28
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them,28
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift,28
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight,28
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,28
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.,28
And how she was beguiled and surprised,28
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,28
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,28
Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:,28
Than any woman in this waning age.,28
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,28
And yet she is inferior to none.,28
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?,28
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:,28
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.,28
And once again a pot o' the smallest ale.,28
O how we joy to see your wit restored!,28
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;,28
These fifteen years! by my fay a goodly nap.,28
O yes my lord but very idle words:,28
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;,28
And say you would present her at the leet,28
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.,28
Why sir you know no house nor no such maid,28
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece,28
And twenty more such names and men as these,28
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!,28
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.,28
How fares my noble lord?,28
Where is my wife?,28
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?,28
My husband and my lord my lord and husband;,28
I know it well. What must I call her?,28
Al'ce madam or Joan madam?,28
call ladies.,28
And slept above some fifteen year or more.,28
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.,28
Madam undress you and come now to bed.,28
To pardon me yet for a night or two,28
For your physicians have expressly charged,28
That I should yet absent me from your bed:,28
Ay it stands so that I may hardly,28
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in,28
Enter a Messenger,28
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;,28
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,28
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,28
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.,28
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?,28
What household stuff?,28
Well well see't. Come madam wife sit by my side,28
Flourish,28
SCENE I. Padua. A public place.,28
Tranio since for the great desire I had,28
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,28
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd,28
My trusty servant well approved in all,28
A course of learning and ingenious studies.,28
Gave me my being and my father first,28
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.,28
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,28
And therefore Tranio for the time I study,28
Will I apply that treats of happiness,28
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left,28
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,28
Mi perdonato gentle master mine,28
Glad that you thus continue your resolve,28
Only good master while we do admire,28
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks I pray;,28
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:,28
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;,28
The mathematics and the metaphysics,28
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:,28
Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise.,28
We could at once put us in readiness,28
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.,28
Master some show to welcome us to town.,28
Gentlemen importune me no farther,28
That is not bestow my youngest daughter,28
If either of you both love Katharina,28
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.,28
There There Hortensio will you any wife?,28
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?,28
Unless you were of gentler milder mould.,28
I wis it is not half way to her heart;,28
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,28
From all such devils good Lord deliver us!,28
Hush master! here's some good pastime toward:,28
But in the other's silence do I see,28
Peace Tranio!,28
Gentlemen that I may soon make good,28
And let it not displease thee good Bianca,28
A pretty peat! it is best,28
Sister content you in my discontent.,28
My books and instruments shall be my company,28
Hark Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.,28
Sorry am I that our good will effects,28
Why will you mew her up,28
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?,28
Go in Bianca:,28
And for I know she taketh most delight,28
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,28
Or Signior Gremio you know any such,28
I will be very kind and liberal,28
And so farewell. Katharina you may stay;,28
Exit,28
shall I be appointed hours; as though belike I,28
Exit,28
good here's none will hold you. Their love is not,28
together and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on,28
sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit,28
wish him to her father.,28
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked,28
that we may yet again have access to our fair,28
labour and effect one thing specially.,28
Marry sir to get a husband for her sister.,28
I say a husband.,28
her father be very rich any man is so very a fool,28
Tush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine,28
fellows in the world an a man could light on them,28
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with,28
every morning.,28
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us,28
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter,28
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man,28
How say you Signior Gremio?,28
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would,28
house of her! Come on.,28
I pray sir tell me is it possible,28
O Tranio till I found it to be true,28
But see while idly I stood looking on,28
And now in plainness do confess to thee,28
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,28
If I achieve not this young modest girl.,28
Assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt.,28
Affection is not rated from the heart:,28
Redime te captum quam queas minimo.',28
The rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound.,28
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.,28
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,28
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.,28
Began to scold and raise up such a storm,28
Tranio I saw her coral lips to move,28
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.,28
I pray awake sir: if you love the maid,28
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd,28
Master your love must live a maid at home;,28
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.,28
But art thou not advised he took some care,28
Ay marry am I sir; and now 'tis plotted.,28
Master for my hand,28
Tell me thine first.,28
And undertake the teaching of the maid:,28
It is: may it be done?,28
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,28
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?,28
We have not yet been seen in any house,28
For man or master; then it follows thus;,28
Keep house and port and servants as I should:,28
Some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa.,28
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:,28
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.,28
In brief sir sith it your pleasure is,28
For so your father charged me at our parting,28
Although I think 'twas in another sense;,28
Because so well I love Lucentio.,28
And let me be a slave to achieve that maid,28
Here comes the rogue.,28
Sirrah where have you been?,28
Master has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or,28
Sirrah come hither: 'tis no time to jest,28
Your fellow Tranio here to save my life,28
And I for my escape have put on his;,28
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:,28
While I make way from hence to save my life:,28
I sir! ne'er a whit.,28
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.,28
So could I faith boy to have the next wish after,28
But sirrah not for my sake but your master's I advise,28
When I am alone why then I am Tranio;,28
Tranio let's go: one thing more rests that,28
thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good,28
Exeunt,28
My lord you nod; you do not mind the play.,28
comes there any more of it?,28
Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady:,28
They sit and mark,28
Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO,28
To see my friends in Padua but of all,28
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.,28
Knock sir! whom should I knock? is there man has,28
Villain I say knock me here soundly.,28
I should knock you here sir?,28
And rap me well or I'll knock your knave's pate.,28
you first,28
Will it not be?,28
I'll try how you can sol fa and sing it.,28
Help masters help! my master is mad.,28
Enter HORTENSIO,28
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?,28
Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.,28
mio Petruchio.' Rise Grumio rise: we will compound,28
Nay 'tis no matter sir what he 'leges in Latin.,28
service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap,28
use his master so being perhaps for aught I see,28
well knock'd at first Then had not Grumio come by the worst.,28
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,28
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these,28
knock me well and knock me soundly'? And come you,28
Sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you.,28
Why this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,28
And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale,28
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,28
Where small experience grows. But in a few,28
Antonio my father is deceased;,28
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:,28
And so am come abroad to see the world.,28
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?,28
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,28
And I'll not wish thee to her.,28
Few words suffice; and therefore if thou know,28
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,28
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd,28
She moves me not or not removes at least,28
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:,28
If wealthily then happily in Padua.,28
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to,28
a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases,28
so money comes withal.,28
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.,28
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,28
Her only fault and that is faults enough,28
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure,28
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.,28
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;,28
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.,28
An affable and courteous gentleman:,28
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.,28
And he knew my deceased father well.,28
And therefore let me be thus bold with you,28
Unless you will accompany me thither.,28
O' my word an she knew him as well as I do she,28
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:,28
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir an she,28
her face and so disfigure her with it that she,28
You know him not sir.,28
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:,28
His youngest daughter beautiful Binaca,28
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,28
For those defects I have before rehearsed,28
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,28
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.,28
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.,28
And offer me disguised in sober robes,28
Well seen in music to instruct Bianca;,28
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,28
Here's no knavery! See to beguile the old folks,28
Enter GREMIO and LUCENTIO disguised,28
Peace Grumio! it is the rival of my love.,28
A proper stripling and an amorous!,28
Hark you sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:,28
And see you read no other lectures to her:,28
Signior Baptista's liberality,28
And let me have them very well perfumed,28
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?,28
As for my patron stand you so assured,28
Yea and perhaps with more successful words,28
O this learning what a thing it is!,28
Peace sirrah!,28
And you are well met Signior Hortensio.,28
I promised to inquire carefully,28
And by good fortune I have lighted well,28
Fit for her turn well read in poetry,28
Tis well; and I have met a gentleman,28
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;,28
To fair Bianca so beloved of me.,28
And that his bags shall prove.,28
Listen to me and if you speak me fair,28
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,28
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,28
So said so done is well.,28
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:,28
No say'st me so friend? What countryman?,28
My father dead my fortune lives for me;,28
O sir such a life with such a wife were strange!,28
You shall have me assisting you in all.,28
Will I live?,28
Why came I hither but to that intent?,28
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?,28
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?,28
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?,28
Loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets' clang?,28
That gives not half so great a blow to hear,28
Tush tush! fear boys with bugs.,28
Hortensio hark:,28
My mind presumes for his own good and ours.,28
And bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er.,28
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.,28
Gentlemen God save you. If I may be bold,28
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?,28
Even he Biondello.,28
Perhaps him and her sir: what have you to do?,28
I love no chiders sir. Biondello let's away.,28
Sir a word ere you go;,28
And if I be sir is it any offence?,28
Why sir I pray are not the streets as free,28
But so is not she.,28
For this reason if you'll know,28
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.,28
Do me this right; hear me with patience.,28
To whom my father is not all unknown;,28
She may more suitors have and me for one.,28
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:,28
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.,28
Sir give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.,28
Sir let me be so bold as ask you,28
No sir; but hear I do that he hath two,28
As is the other for beauteous modesty.,28
Yea leave that labour to great Hercules;,28
Sir understand you this of me in sooth:,28
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,28
Until the elder sister first be wed:,28
If it be so sir that you are the man,28
And if you break the ice and do this feat,28
For our access whose hap shall be to have her,28
Sir you say well and well you do conceive;,28
You must as we do gratify this gentleman,28
Sir I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,28
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,28
Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends.,28
The motion's good indeed and be it so,28
Exeunt,28
SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.,28
Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself,28
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,28
Yea all my raiment to my petticoat;,28
So well I know my duty to my elders.,28
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.,28
I never yet beheld that special face,28
Minion thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?,28
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have,28
O then belike you fancy riches more:,28
Is it for him you do envy me so?,28
You have but jested with me all this while:,28
If that be jest then all the rest was so.,28
Enter BAPTISTA,28
Bianca stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.,28
For shame thou helding of a devilish spirit,28
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?,28
Flies after BIANCA,28
Exit BIANCA,28
She is your treasure she must have a husband;,28
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.,28
Till I can find occasion of revenge.,28
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?,28
Enter GREMIO LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;  PETRUCHIO with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books,28
Good morrow neighbour Gremio.,28
And you good sir! Pray have you not a daughter,28
I have a daughter sir called Katharina.,28
You wrong me Signior Gremio: give me leave.,28
That hearing of her beauty and her wit,28
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,28
Within your house to make mine eye the witness,28
And for an entrance to my entertainment,28
Presenting HORTENSIO,28
To instruct her fully in those sciences,28
Accept of him or else you do me wrong:,28
You're welcome sir; and he for your good sake.,28
She is not for your turn the more my grief.,28
Or else you like not of my company.,28
Whence are you sir? what may I call your name?,28
A man well known throughout all Italy.,28
Saving your tale Petruchio I pray,28
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.,28
I doubt it not sir; but you will curse your,28
sure of it. To express the like kindness myself,28
any freely give unto you this young scholar,28
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning,28
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,28
A thousand thanks Signior Gremio.,28
To TRANIO,28
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?,28
That being a stranger in this city here,28
Unto Bianca fair and virtuous.,28
In the preferment of the eldest sister.,28
That upon knowledge of my parentage,28
And free access and favour as the rest:,28
I here bestow a simple instrument,28
If you accept them then their worth is great.,28
Of Pisa sir; son to Vincentio.,28
I know him well: you are very welcome sir,28
You shall go see your pupils presently.,28
Enter a Servant,28
To my daughters; and tell them both,28
Exit Servant with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO BIONDELLO following,28
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,28
Signior Baptista my business asketh haste,28
You knew my father well and in him me,28
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:,28
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?,28
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.,28
Her widowhood be it that she survive me,28
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,28
Ay when the special thing is well obtain'd,28
Why that is nothing: for I tell you father,28
And where two raging fires meet together,28
Though little fire grows great with little wind,28
So I to her and so she yields to me;,28
Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed!,28
Ay to the proof; as mountains are for winds,28
Re-enter HORTENSIO with his head broke,28
For fear I promise you if I look pale.,28
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier,28
Why then thou canst not break her to the lute?,28
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,28
When with a most impatient devilish spirit,28
with them:',28
And through the instrument my pate made way;,28
As on a pillory looking through the lute;,28
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,28
Now by the world it is a lusty wench;,28
O how I long to have some chat with her!,28
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;,28
Signior Petruchio will you go with us,28
I pray you do.,28
I will attend her here,28
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain,28
Say that she frown I'll say she looks as clear,28
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;,28
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:,28
As though she bid me stay by her a week:,28
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.,28
Enter KATHARINA,28
Well have you heard but something hard of hearing:,28
You lie in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,28
But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom,28
For dainties are all Kates and therefore Kate,28
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,28
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,28
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither,28
You were a moveable.,28
A join'd-stool.,28
Asses are made to bear and so are you.,28
No such jade as you if me you mean.,28
For knowing thee to be but young and light--,28
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.,28
Well ta'en and like a buzzard.,28
Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard.,28
If I be waspish best beware my sting.,28
Ay if the fool could find it where it lies,28
wear his sting? In his tail.,28
Whose tongue?,28
What with my tongue in your tail? nay come again,28
That I'll try.,28
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.,28
If you strike me you are no gentleman;,28
A herald Kate? O put me in thy books!,28
A combless cock so Kate will be my hen.,28
Nay come Kate come; you must not look so sour.,28
Why here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.,28
Then show it me.,28
What you mean my face?,28
Now by Saint George I am too young for you.,28
Tis with cares.,28
Nay hear you Kate: in sooth you scape not so.,28
No not a whit: I find you passing gentle.,28
And now I find report a very liar;,28
But slow in speech yet sweet as spring-time flowers:,28
Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,28
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,28
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?,28
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue,28
O let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.,28
Did ever Dian so become a grove,28
O be thou Dian and let her be Kate;,28
Where did you study all this goodly speech?,28
A witty mother! witless else her son.,28
Yes; keep you warm.,28
And therefore setting all this chat aside,28
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;,28
Now Kate I am a husband for your turn;,28
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,28
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,28
Conformable as other household Kates.,28
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.,28
Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter?,28
It were impossible I should speed amiss.,28
Call you me daughter? now I promise you,28
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;,28
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.,28
That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her:,28
For she's not froward but modest as the dove;,28
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,28
And to conclude we have 'greed so well together,28
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.,28
hang'd first.,28
Be patient gentlemen; I choose her for myself:,28
Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain being alone,28
I tell you 'tis incredible to believe,28
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss,28
That in a twink she won me to her love.,28
How tame when men and women are alone,28
Give me thy hand Kate: I will unto Venice,28
Provide the feast father and bid the guests;,28
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;,28
Amen say we: we will be witnesses.,28
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:,28
And kiss me Kate we will be married o'Sunday.,28
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?,28
And venture madly on a desperate mart.,28
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.,28
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.,28
Now is the day we long have looked for:,28
And I am one that love Bianca more,28
Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I.,28
But thine doth fry.,28
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.,28
Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both,28
Shall have my Bianca's love.,28
First as you know my house within the city,28
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;,28
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;,28
Costly apparel tents and canopies,28
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,28
To house or housekeeping: then at my farm,28
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,28
Myself am struck in years I must confess;,28
If whilst I live she will be only mine.,28
I am my father's heir and only son:,28
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,28
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;,28
Of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure.,28
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!,28
That she shall have; besides an argosy,28
What have I choked you with an argosy?,28
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,28
And twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next.,28
And she can have no more than all I have:,28
Why then the maid is mine from all the world,28
I must confess your offer is the best;,28
She is your own; else you must pardon me,28
That's but a cavil: he is old I young.,28
Well gentlemen,28
My daughter Katharina is to be married:,28
Be bride to you if you this assurance;,28
And so I take my leave and thank you both.,28
Exit BAPTISTA,28
Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool,28
Set foot under thy table: tut a toy!,28
Exit,28
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.,28
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio,28
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly,28
A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning.,28
ACT III,28
Enter LUCENTIO HORTENSIO and BIANCA,28
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment,28
But wrangling pedant this is,28
Then give me leave to have prerogative;,28
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.,28
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!,28
After his studies or his usual pain?,28
And while I pause serve in your harmony.,28
Why gentlemen you do me double wrong,28
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;,28
But learn my lessons as I please myself.,28
Take you your instrument play you the whiles;,28
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?,28
Where left we last?,28
Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;,28
Construe them.,28
Lucentio 'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,28
Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that comes,28
bearing my port 'celsa senis' that we might,28
Madam my instrument's in tune.,28
Spit in the hole man and tune again.,28
Simois' I know you not 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I,28
he hear us not 'regia' presume not 'celsa senis',28
Madam 'tis now in tune.,28
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.,28
How fiery and forward our pedant is!,28
Pedascule I'll watch you better yet.,28
Mistrust it not: for sure AEacides,28
I must believe my master; else I promise you,28
But let it rest. Now Licio to you:,28
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.,28
My lessons make no music in three parts.,28
Aside,28
Our fine musician groweth amorous.,28
To learn the order of my fingering,28
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,28
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:,28
Why I am past my gamut long ago.,28
[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am the ground of all accord,28
B mi' Bianca take him for thy lord,28
D sol re' one clef two notes have I:,28
Call you this gamut? tut I like it not:,28
To change true rules for old inventions.,28
Mistress your father prays you leave your books,28
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.,28
Exeunt BIANCA and Servant,28
Exit,28
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:,28
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,28
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.,28
SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.,28
[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio this is the,28
That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,28
What will be said? what mockery will it be,28
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!,28
No shame but mine: I must forsooth be forced,28
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;,28
I told you I he was a frantic fool,28
And to be noted for a merry man,28
Make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns;,28
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,28
If it would please him come and marry her!',28
Upon my life Petruchio means but well,28
Though he be blunt I know him passing wise;,28
Would Katharina had never seen him though!,28
Go girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;,28
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.,28
Master master! news old news and such news as,28
Is it new and old too? how may that be?,28
Is he come?,28
What then?,28
When will he be here?,28
But say what to thine old news?,28
jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair,28
another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the,28
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an,28
besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose,28
with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with,28
stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the,28
near-legged before and with a half-chequed bit,28
restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been,28
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,28
in studs and here and there pieced with packthread.,28
O sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned,28
kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red,28
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster a,28
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.,28
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.,28
Why sir he comes not.,28
Who? that Petruchio came?,28
No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back.,28
Nay by Saint Jamy,28
A horse and a man,28
And yet not many.,28
Come where be these gallants? who's at home?,28
And yet I come not well.,28
Not so well apparell'd,28
Were it better I should rush in thus.,28
How does my father? Gentles methinks you frown:,28
As if they saw some wondrous monument,28
Why sir you know this is your wedding-day:,28
Now sadder that you come so unprovided.,28
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!,28
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,28
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear:,28
Though in some part enforced to digress;,28
As you shall well be satisfied withal.,28
The morning wears 'tis time we were at church.,28
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.,28
But thus I trust you will not marry her.,28
To me she's married not unto my clothes:,28
As I can change these poor accoutrements,28
But what a fool am I to chat with you,28
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!,28
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:,28
To put on better ere he go to church.,28
Exeunt BAPTISTA GREMIO and attendants,28
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,28
I am to get a man--whate'er he be,28
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;,28
Of greater sums than I have promised.,28
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.,28
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,28
Which once perform'd let all the world say no,28
That by degrees we mean to look into,28
We'll over-reach the greybeard Gremio,28
The quaint musician amorous Licio;,28
Re-enter GREMIO,28
As willingly as e'er I came from school.,28
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,28
Curster than she? why 'tis impossible.,28
Why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam.,28
I'll tell you Sir Lucentio: when the priest,28
Ay by gogs-wouns' quoth he; and swore so loud,28
And as he stoop'd again to take it up,28
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:,28
What said the wench when he rose again?,28
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.,28
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he as if,28
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,28
Having no other reason,28
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.,28
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack,28
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;,28
Such a mad marriage never was before:,28
Music,28
Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains:,28
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;,28
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.,28
I must away to-day before night come:,28
You would entreat me rather go than stay.,28
That have beheld me give away myself,28
Dine with my father drink a health to me;,28
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.,28
Let me entreat you.,28
Let me entreat you.,28
Are you content to stay?,28
But yet not stay entreat me how you can.,28
Grumio my horse.,28
Nay then,28
No nor to-morrow not till I please myself.,28
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;,28
Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,28
O Kate content thee; prithee be not angry.,28
Father be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.,28
Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner:,28
If she had not a spirit to resist.,28
Obey the bride you that attend on her;,28
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,28
But for my bonny Kate she must with me.,28
I will be master of what is mine own:,28
My household stuff my field my barn,28
And here she stands touch her whoever dare;,28
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,28
Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man.,28
thee Kate:,28
Exeunt PETRUCHIO KATHARINA and GRUMIO,28
Went they not quickly I should die with laughing.,28
Mistress what's your opinion of your sister?,28
I warrant him Petruchio is Kated.,28
bridegroom wants,28
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.,28
And let Bianca take her sister's room.,28
She shall Lucentio. Come gentlemen let's go.,28
ACT IV,28
Enter GRUMIO,28
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever,28
before to make a fire and they are coming after to,28
hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my,28
belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but,28
considering the weather a taller man than I will,28
Enter CURTIS,28
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it thou mayst slide,28
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.,28
O ay Curtis ay: and therefore fire fire; cast,28
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?,28
knowest winter tames man woman and beast; for it,28
myself fellow Curtis.,28
Am I but three inches? why thy horn is a foot; and,28
fire or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,28
feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in thy hot office?,28
A cold world Curtis in every office but thine; and,28
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.,28
Why 'Jack boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as,28
Come you are so full of cony-catching!,28
Where's the cook? is supper ready the house,28
serving-men in their new fustian their white,28
Be the jacks fair within the jills fair without,28
All ready; and therefore I pray thee news.,28
mistress fallen out.,28
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby,28
Let's ha't good Grumio.,28
Here.,28
Strikes him,28
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this,28
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis we came down a,28
Both of one horse?,28
Why a horse.,28
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she,28
miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her,28
her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt,28
that never prayed before how I cried how the,28
lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory,28
unexperienced to thy grave.,28
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall,28
Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip,28
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their,28
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair,28
hands. Are they all ready?,28
Call them forth.,28
countenance my mistress.,28
Who knows not that?,28
countenance her.,28
Why she comes to borrow nothing of them.,28
Welcome home Grumio!,28
What Grumio!,28
How now old lad?,28
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now my spruce,28
All things is ready. How near is our master?,28
not--Cock's passion silence! I hear my master.,28
Where be these knaves? What no man at door,28
Where is Nathaniel Gregory Philip?,28
Here sir! here sir! here sir! here sir!,28
What no attendance? no regard? no duty?,28
Here sir; as foolish as I was before.,28
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,28
Nathaniel's coat sir was not fully made,28
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,28
There were none fine but Adam Ralph and Gregory;,28
Yet as they are here are they come to meet you.,28
Exeunt Servants,28
Where is the life that late I led--,28
Sound sound sound sound!,28
Why when I say? Nay good sweet Kate be merry.,28
Sings,28
As he forth walked on his way:--,28
Take that and mend the plucking off the other.,28
Be merry Kate. Some water here; what ho!,28
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:,28
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?,28
Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily.,28
Strikes him,28
A whoreson beetle-headed flap-ear'd knave!,28
Will you give thanks sweet Kate; or else shall I?,28
Ay.,28
I.,28
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?,28
And serve it thus to me that love it not?,28
Throws the meat  and c. about the stage,28
What do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.,28
The meat was well if you were so contented.,28
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,28
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,28
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.,28
And for this night we'll fast for company:,28
Exeunt,28
Peter didst ever see the like?,28
Re-enter CURTIS,28
In her chamber making a sermon of continency to her;,28
Knows not which way to stand to look to speak,28
Away away! for he is coming hither.,28
Re-enter PETRUCHIO,28
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.,28
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,28
Another way I have to man my haggard,28
That is to watch her as we watch these kites,28
She eat no meat to-day nor none shall eat;,28
As with the meat some undeserved fault,28
And here I'll fling the pillow there the bolster,28
Ay and amid this hurly I intend,28
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:,28
And with the clamour keep her still awake.,28
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.,28
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.,28
SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.,28
Is't possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca,28
I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand.,28
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.,28
Now mistress profit you in what you read?,28
I read that I profess the Art to Love.,28
While you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart!,28
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca,28
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!,28
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,28
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,28
And makes a god of such a cullion:,28
Signior Hortensio I have often heard,28
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,28
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.,28
Here is my hand and here I firmly vow,28
As one unworthy all the former favours,28
And here I take the unfeigned oath,28
Fie on her! see how beastly she doth court him!,28
For me that I may surely keep mine oath,28
Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me,28
And so farewell Signior Lucentio.,28
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,28
Exit,28
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!,28
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.,28
Mistress we have.,28
I' faith he'll have a lusty widow now,28
God give him joy!,28
He says so Tranio.,28
The taming-school! what is there such a place?,28
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,28
Enter BIONDELLO,28
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied,28
Will serve the turn.,28
Master a mercatante or a pedant,28
In gait and countenance surely like a father.,28
If he be credulous and trust my tale,28
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,28
Take in your love and then let me alone.,28
Enter a Pedant,28
And you sir! you are welcome.,28
Sir at the farthest for a week or two:,28
And so to Tripoli if God lend me life.,28
Of Mantua.,28
And come to Padua careless of your life?,28
Tis death for any one in Mantua,28
Your ships are stay'd at Venice and the duke,28
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:,28
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.,28
For I have bills for money by exchange,28
Well sir to do you courtesy,28
First tell me have you ever been at Pisa?,28
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.,28
I know him not but I have heard of him;,28
He is my father sir; and sooth to say,28
[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,28
To save your life in this extremity,28
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes,28
His name and credit shall you undertake,28
Look that you take upon you as you should;,28
Till you have done your business in the city:,28
O sir I do; and will repute you ever,28
Then go with me to make the matter good.,28
my father is here look'd for every day,28
Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:,28
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.,28
SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.,28
No no forsooth; I dare not for my life.,28
What did he marry me to famish me?,28
Upon entreaty have a present aims;,28
But I who never knew how to entreat,28
Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep,28
And that which spites me more than all these wants,28
As who should say if I should sleep or eat,28
I prithee go and get me some repast;,28
What say you to a neat's foot?,28
I fear it is too choleric a meat.,28
I like it well: good Grumio fetch it me.,28
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?,28
Ay but the mustard is too hot a little.,28
Nay then I will not: you shall have the mustard,28
Then both or one or any thing thou wilt.,28
Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave,28
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:,28
That triumph thus upon my misery!,28
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat,28
Mistress what cheer?,28
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.,28
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:,28
What not a word? Nay then thou lovest it not;,28
Here take away this dish.,28
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;,28
I thank you sir.,28
Come mistress Kate I'll bear you company.,28
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!,28
Will we return unto thy father's house,28
With silken coats and caps and golden rings,28
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,28
What hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,28
Enter Tailor,28
Lay forth the gown.,28
What news with you sir?,28
Why this was moulded on a porringer;,28
Why 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,28
Away with it! come let me have a bigger.,28
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these,28
And not till then.,28
Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak;,28
Your betters have endured me say my mind,28
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,28
And rather than it shall I will be free,28
Why thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,28
I love thee well in that thou likest it not.,28
And it I will have or I will have none.,28
Thy gown? why ay: come tailor let us see't.,28
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:,28
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,28
Why what i' devil's name tailor call'st thou this?,28
You bid me make it orderly and well,28
Marry and did; but if you be remember'd,28
Go hop me over every kennel home,28
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.,28
More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable:,28
Why true; he means to make a puppet of thee.,28
a puppet of her.,28
thou thimble,28
Thou flea thou nit thou winter-cricket thou!,28
Away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant;,28
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!,28
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made,28
Grumio gave order how it should be done.,28
But how did you desire it should be made?,28
But did you not request to have it cut?,28
I have.,28
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto,28
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo thou liest.,28
Read it.,28
[Reads]  'Imprimis a loose-bodied gown:',28
the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom,28
Proceed.,28
I confess the cape.,28
I confess two sleeves.,28
Ay there's the villany.,28
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and,28
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.,28
in place where thou shouldst know it.,28
bill give me thy mete-yard and spare not me.,28
Well sir in brief the gown is not for me.,28
Go take it up unto thy master's use.,28
gown for thy master's use!,28
O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for:,28
O fie fie fie!,28
Go take it hence; be gone and say no more.,28
Take no unkindness of his hasty words:,28
Exit Tailor,28
Even in these honest mean habiliments:,28
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;,28
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.,28
Because his fathers are more beautiful?,28
Because his painted skin contents the eye?,28
For this poor furniture and mean array.,28
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,28
Go call my men and let us straight to him;,28
There will we mount and thither walk on foot,28
And well we may come there by dinner-time.,28
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.,28
Look what I speak or do or think to do,28
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,28
[Aside]  Why so this gallant will command the sun.,28
SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.,28
Sir this is the house: please it you that I call?,28
Signior Baptista may remember me,28
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.,28
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.,28
Enter BIONDELLO,28
Twere good he were school'd.,28
Now do your duty throughly I advise you:,28
Tut fear not me.,28
I told him that your father was at Venice,28
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.,28
Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO,28
To the Pedant,28
I pray you stand good father to me now,28
Soft son!,28
To gather in some debts my son Lucentio,28
Of love between your daughter and himself:,28
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,28
I am content in a good father's care,28
No worse than I upon some agreement,28
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;,28
Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well.,28
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.,28
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,28
And therefore if you say no more than this,28
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,28
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.,28
We be affied and such assurance ta'en,28
Not in my house Lucentio; for you know,28
Besides old Gremio is hearkening still;,28
Then at my lodging an it like you:,28
We'll pass the business privately and well.,28
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.,28
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.,28
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;,28
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,28
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!,28
Exit BIONDELLO,28
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:,28
I follow you.,28
Re-enter BIONDELLO,28
What sayest thou Biondello?,28
Biondello what of that?,28
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.,28
Then thus. Baptista is safe talking with the,28
And what of him?,28
And then?,28
command at all hours.,28
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a,28
cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the,28
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,28
ever and a day.,28
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an,28
stuff a rabbit; and so may you sir: and so adieu,28
Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against,28
Exit,28
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?,28
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.,28
SCENE V. A public road.,28
Come on i' God's name; once more toward our father's.,28
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.,28
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.,28
It shall be moon or star or what I list,28
Go on and fetch our horses back again.,28
Say as he says or we shall never go.,28
And be it moon or sun or what you please:,28
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.,28
I know it is the moon.,28
Then God be bless'd it is the blessed sun:,28
And the moon changes even as your mind.,28
And so it shall be so for Katharina.,28
Well forward forward! thus the bowl should run,28
But soft! company is coming here.,28
To VINCENTIO,28
Tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too,28
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!,28
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?,28
Sweet Kate embrace her for her beauty's sake.,28
Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet,28
Happy the parents of so fair a child;,28
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!,28
This is a man old wrinkled faded wither'd,28
Pardon old father my mistaking eyes,28
That everything I look on seemeth green:,28
Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking.,28
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,28
Fair sir and you my merry mistress,28
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;,28
A son of mine which long I have not seen.,28
Lucentio gentle sir.,28
And now by law as well as reverend age,28
The sister to my wife this gentlewoman,28
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,28
Beside so qualified as may beseem,28
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,28
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.,28
Like pleasant travellers to break a jest,28
I do assure thee father so it is.,28
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.,28
Well Petruchio this has put me in heart.,28
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.,28
ACT V,28
GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO LUCENTIO and BIANCA,28
I fly Biondello: but they may chance to need thee,28
Nay faith I'll see the church o' your back; and,28
Exeunt LUCENTIO BIANCA and BIONDELLO,28
Enter PETRUCHIO KATHARINA VINCENTIO GRUMIO with Attendants,28
My father's bears more toward the market-place;,28
You shall not choose but drink before you go:,28
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.,28
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.,28
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?,28
He's within sir but not to be spoken withal.,28
make merry withal?,28
need none so long as I live.,28
Do you hear sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,28
come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him.,28
looking out at the window.,28
Ay sir; so his mother says if I may believe her.,28
is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.,28
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.,28
I have seen them in the church together: God send,28
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.,28
Come hither crack-hemp.,28
Come hither you rogue. What have you forgot me?,28
never saw you before in all my life.,28
thy master's father Vincentio?,28
see where he looks out of the window.,28
Beats BIONDELLO,28
Exit,28
Exit from above,28
this controversy.,28
Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO BAPTISTA and Servants,28
What am I sir! nay what are you sir? O immortal,28
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O I,28
husband at home my son and my servant spend all at,28
How now! what's the matter?,28
Sir you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your,28
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I,28
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.,28
you think is his name?,28
him up ever since he was three years old and his,28
Away away mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is,28
Lucentio! O he hath murdered his master! Lay hold,28
son my son! Tell me thou villain where is my son Lucentio?,28
Enter one with an Officer,28
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.,28
Stay officer: he shall not go to prison.,28
Take heed Signior Baptista lest you be,28
is the right Vincentio.,28
Nay I dare not swear it.,28
Yes I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.,28
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O,28
Re-enter BIONDELLO with LUCENTIO and BIANCA,28
forswear him or else we are all undone.,28
Lives my sweet son?,28
Pardon dear father.,28
Where is Lucentio?,28
Right son to the right Vincentio;,28
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.,28
Where is that damned villain Tranio,28
Why tell me is not this my Cambio?,28
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love,28
While he did bear my countenance in the town;,28
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.,28
Then pardon him sweet father for my sake.,28
me to the gaol.,28
without asking my good will?,28
I will in to be revenged for this villany.,28
And I to sound the depth of this knavery.,28
Look not pale Bianca; thy father will not frown.,28
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,28
Exit,28
First kiss me Kate and we will.,28
What art thou ashamed of me?,28
Why then let's home again. Come sirrah let's away.,28
Is not this well? Come my sweet Kate:,28
Exeunt,28
Enter BAPTISTA VINCENTIO GREMIO the Pedant  LUCENTIO BIANCA PETRUCHIO KATHARINA HORTENSIO  and Widow TRANIO BIONDELLO and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet,28
And time it is when raging war is done,28
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome,28
Brother Petruchio sister Katharina,28
Feast with the best and welcome to my house:,28
After our great good cheer. Pray you sit down;,28
Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat!,28
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.,28
Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow.,28
You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense:,28
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.,28
Mistress how mean you that?,28
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?,28
Very well mended. Kiss him for that good widow.,28
I pray you tell me what you meant by that.,28
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:,28
A very mean meaning.,28
And I am mean indeed respecting you.,28
To her widow!,28
That's my office.,28
Drinks to HORTENSIO,28
Believe me sir they butt together well.,28
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.,28
Ay but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.,28
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!,28
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.,28
Exeunt BIANCA KATHARINA and Widow,28
This bird you aim'd at though you hit her not;,28
O sir Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,28
A good swift simile but something currish.,28
Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.,28
I thank thee for that gird good Tranio.,28
A' has a little gall'd me I confess;,28
Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.,28
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.,28
Let's each one send unto his wife;,28
To come at first when he doth send for her,28
Content. What is the wager?,28
Twenty crowns!,28
But twenty times so much upon my wife.,28
Content.,28
Who shall begin?,28
Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me.,28
Exit,28
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.,28
How now! what news?,28
That she is busy and she cannot come.,28
Is that an answer?,28
Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse.,28
Sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife,28
Exit BIONDELLO,28
Nay then she must needs come.,28
Do what you can yours will not be entreated.,28
Now where's my wife?,28
She will not come: she bids you come to her.,28
Intolerable not to be endured!,28
Say I command her to come to me.,28
I know her answer.,28
She will not.,28
Now by my holidame here comes Katharina!,28
What is your will sir that you send for me?,28
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.,28
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:,28
Exit KATHARINA,28
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.,28
And awful rule and right supremacy;,28
Now fair befal thee good Petruchio!,28
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;,28
For she is changed as she had never been.,28
And show more sign of her obedience,28
See where she comes and brings your froward wives,28
Re-enter KATHARINA with BIANCA and Widow,28
Off with that bauble throw it under-foot.,28
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!,28
I would your duty were as foolish too:,28
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.,28
Katharina I charge thee tell these headstrong women,28
Come come you're mocking: we will have no telling.,28
She shall not.,28
Fie fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,28
To wound thy lord thy king thy governor:,28
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,28
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,28
And while it is so none so dry or thirsty,28
Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper,28
And for thy maintenance commits his body,28
To watch the night in storms the day in cold,28
And craves no other tribute at thy hands,28
Too little payment for so great a debt.,28
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;,28
And not obedient to his honest will,28
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?,28
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;,28
When they are bound to serve love and obey.,28
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,28
Should well agree with our external parts?,28
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,28
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;,28
Our strength as weak our weakness past compare,28
Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot,28
In token of which duty if he please,28
Why there's a wench! Come on and kiss me Kate.,28
Tis a good hearing when children are toward.,28
Come Kate we'll to bed.,28
To LUCENTIO,28
And being a winner God give you good night!,28
Now go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.,28
Exeunt,28
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise,29
Enter a Master and a Boatswain,29
Here master: what cheer?,29
or we run ourselves aground: bestir bestir.,29
Enter Mariners,29
yare yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the,29
if room enough!,29
Good boatswain have care. Where's the master?,29
I pray now keep below.,29
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your,29
Nay good be patient.,29
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.,29
None that I more love than myself. You are a,29
silence and work the peace of the present we will,29
cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make,29
the hour if it so hap. Cheerly good hearts! Out,29
Exit,29
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is,29
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,29
born to be hanged our case is miserable.,29
Re-enter Boatswain,29
her to try with main-course.,29
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than,29
Re-enter SEBASTIAN ANTONIO and GONZALO,29
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?,29
incharitable dog!,29
Hang cur! hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker!,29
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were,29
unstanched wench.,29
sea again; lay her off.,29
All lost! to prayers to prayers! all lost!,29
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,29
I'm out of patience.,29
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning,29
He'll be hang'd yet,29
And gape at widest to glut him.,29
Let's all sink with the king.,29
Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN,29
acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any,29
die a dry death.,29
SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.,29
If by your art my dearest father you have,29
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,29
Dashes the fire out. O I have suffered,29
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,29
Against my very heart. Poor souls they perish'd.,29
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere,29
The fraughting souls within her.,29
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart,29
O woe the day!,29
I have done nothing but in care of thee,29
Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing,29
Than Prospero master of a full poor cell,29
More to know,29
Tis time,29
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:,29
Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.,29
The very virtue of compassion in thee,29
So safely ordered that there is no soul--,29
Betid to any creature in the vessel,29
For thou must now know farther.,29
Begun to tell me what I am but stopp'd,29
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.',29
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;,29
A time before we came unto this cell?,29
Out three years old.,29
By what? by any other house or person?,29
Hath kept with thy remembrance.,29
And rather like a dream than an assurance,29
Four or five women once that tended me?,29
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else,29
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,29
But that I do not.,29
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and,29
Sir are not you my father?,29
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father,29
And princess no worse issued.,29
What foul play had we that we came from thence?,29
Both both my girl:,29
But blessedly holp hither.,29
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,29
My brother and thy uncle call'd Antonio--,29
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself,29
The manage of my state; as at that time,29
And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed,29
Without a parallel; those being all my study,29
And to my state grew stranger being transported,29
Dost thou attend me?,29
Being once perfected how to grant suits,29
To trash for over-topping new created,29
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key,29
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was,29
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.,29
I pray thee mark me.,29
To closeness and the bettering of my mind,29
O'er-prized all popular rate in my false brother,29
Like a good parent did beget of him,29
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,29
Not only with what my revenue yielded,29
Who having into truth by telling of it,29
To credit his own lie he did believe,29
And executing the outward face of royalty,29
Dost thou hear?,29
To have no screen between this part he play'd,29
Absolute Milan. Me poor man my library,29
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--,29
To give him annual tribute do him homage,29
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas poor Milan!--,29
O the heavens!,29
If this might be a brother.,29
To think but nobly of my grandmother:,29
Now the condition.,29
To me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit;,29
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,29
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan,29
A treacherous army levied one midnight,29
The gates of Milan and i' the dead of darkness,29
Me and thy crying self.,29
I not remembering how I cried out then,29
That wrings mine eyes to't.,29
And then I'll bring thee to the present business,29
Were most impertinent.,29
That hour destroy us?,29
My tale provokes that question. Dear they durst not,29
A mark so bloody on the business but,29
In few they hurried us aboard a bark,29
A rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd,29
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,29
To the winds whose pity sighing back again,29
Alack what trouble,29
O a cherubim,29
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,29
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me,29
Against what should ensue.,29
By Providence divine.,29
A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo,29
Master of this design did give us with,29
Which since have steaded much; so of his gentleness,29
From mine own library with volumes that,29
Would I might,29
Now I arise:,29
Sit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.,29
Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit,29
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.,29
For still 'tis beating in my mind your reason,29
Know thus far forth.,29
Now my dear lady hath mine enemies,29
I find my zenith doth depend upon,29
If now I court not but omit my fortunes,29
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,29
MIRANDA sleeps,29
Approach my Ariel come.,29
All hail great master! grave sir hail! I come,29
To swim to dive into the fire to ride,29
Ariel and all his quality.,29
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?,29
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,29
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,29
The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,29
O' the dreadful thunder-claps more momentary,29
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune,29
Yea his dread trident shake.,29
Who was so firm so constant that this coil,29
Not a soul,29
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners,29
Then all afire with me: the king's son Ferdinand,29
Was the first man that leap'd; cried 'Hell is empty,29
Why that's my spirit!,29
Close by my master.,29
Not a hair perish'd;,29
But fresher than before: and as thou badest me,29
The king's son have I landed by himself;,29
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,29
Of the king's ship,29
And all the rest o' the fleet.,29
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook where once,29
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes there she's hid:,29
Who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,29
Which I dispersed they all have met again,29
Bound sadly home for Naples,29
And his great person perish.,29
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.,29
Past the mid season.,29
Must by us both be spent most preciously.,29
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,29
How now? moody?,29
My liberty.,29
I prithee,29
Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served,29
To bate me a full year.,29
From what a torment I did free thee?,29
Thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze,29
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,29
When it is baked with frost.,29
Thou liest malignant thing! Hast thou forgot,29
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?,29
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.,29
O was she so? I must,29
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,29
To enter human hearing from Argier,29
They would not take her life. Is not this true?,29
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,29
As thou report'st thyself wast then her servant;,29
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,29
By help of her more potent ministers,29
Into a cloven pine; within which rift,29
A dozen years; within which space she died,29
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--,29
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with,29
Yes Caliban her son.,29
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st,29
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts,29
To lay upon the damn'd which Sycorax,29
When I arrived and heard thee that made gape,29
I thank thee master.,29
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till,29
Pardon master;,29
And do my spiriting gently.,29
I will discharge thee.,29
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?,29
To no sight but thine and mine invisible,29
And hither come in't: go hence with diligence!,29
Awake dear heart awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!,29
Heaviness in me.,29
We'll visit Caliban my slave who never,29
Tis a villain sir,29
But as 'tis,29
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices,29
Thou earth thou! speak.,29
Come forth I say! there's other business for thee:,29
Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph,29
Hark in thine ear.,29
Exit,29
Upon thy wicked dam come forth!,29
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd,29
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye,29
For this be sure to-night thou shalt have cramps,29
Shall for that vast of night that they may work,29
As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging,29
I must eat my dinner.,29
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,29
Water with berries in't and teach me how,29
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,29
The fresh springs brine-pits barren place and fertile:,29
Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you!,29
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me,29
The rest o' the island.,29
Whom stripes may move not kindness! I have used thee,29
In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate,29
O ho O ho! would't had been done!,29
This isle with Calibans.,29
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,29
Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour,29
Know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like,29
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,29
good natures,29
Deservedly confined into this rock,29
You taught me language; and my profit on't,29
For learning me your language!,29
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick thou'rt best,29
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly,29
Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar,29
No pray thee.,29
I must obey: his art is of such power,29
and make a vassal of him.,29
Exit CALIBAN,29
ARIEL'S song.,29
And then take hands:,29
The wild waves whist,29
And sweet sprites the burthen bear.,29
Burthen [dispersedly within,29
Burthen Bow-wow,29
The strain of strutting chanticleer,29
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?,29
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,29
This music crept by me upon the waters,29
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,29
No it begins again.,29
Full fathom five thy father lies;,29
Those are pearls that were his eyes:,29
But doth suffer a sea-change,29
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell,29
Hark! now I hear them--Ding-dong bell.,29
This is no mortal business nor no sound,29
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,29
What is't? a spirit?,29
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.,29
As we have such. This gallant which thou seest,29
With grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him,29
And strays about to find 'em.,29
A thing divine for nothing natural,29
[Aside] It goes on I see,29
Within two days for this.,29
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer,29
And that you will some good instruction give,29
Which I do last pronounce is O you wonder!,29
No wonder sir;,29
My language! heavens!,29
Were I but where 'tis spoken.,29
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?,29
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;,29
Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld,29
Alack for mercy!,29
And his brave son being twain.,29
And his more braver daughter could control thee,29
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,29
To FERDINAND,29
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.,29
Is the third man that e'er I saw the first,29
To be inclined my way!,29
And your affection not gone forth I'll make you,29
Soft sir! one word more.,29
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business,29
Make the prize light.,29
One word more; I charge thee,29
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself,29
From me the lord on't.,29
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:,29
Good things will strive to dwell with't.,29
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;,29
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be,29
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.,29
I will resist such entertainment till,29
Draws and is charmed from moving,29
Make not too rash a trial of him for,29
What? I say,29
Who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience,29
For I can here disarm thee with this stick,29
Beseech you father.,29
Sir have pity;,29
Silence! one word more,29
An advocate for an imposter! hush!,29
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!,29
And they to him are angels.,29
Are then most humble; I have no ambition,29
Come on; obey:,29
And have no vigour in them.,29
My spirits as in a dream are all bound up.,29
The wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats,29
Might I but through my prison once a day,29
Let liberty make use of; space enough,29
[Aside]                It works.,29
Come on.,29
To FERDINAND,29
To ARIEL,29
Be of comfort;,29
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted,29
Thou shalt be free,29
All points of my command.,29
Come follow. Speak not for him.,29
ACT II,29
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and others,29
So have we all of joy; for our escape,29
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,29
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,29
Can speak like us: then wisely good sir weigh,29
Prithee peace.,29
The visitor will not give him o'er so.,29
by and by it will strike.,29
One: tell.,29
Comes to the entertainer--,29
Dolour comes to him indeed: you,29
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.,29
Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!,29
Well I have done: but yet--,29
Which of he or Adrian for a good,29
The old cock.,29
Done. The wager?,29
A match!,29
Ha ha ha! So you're paid.,29
Yet--,29
He could not miss't.,29
temperance.,29
Ay and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.,29
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.,29
Here is everything advantageous to life.,29
Of that there's none or little.,29
The ground indeed is tawny.,29
He misses not much.,29
But the rarity of it is--which is indeed almost,29
As many vouched rarities are.,29
the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and,29
salt water.,29
say he lies?,29
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we,29
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.,29
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to,29
Not since widow Dido's time.,29
widow Dido!,29
how you take it!,29
she was of Carthage not of Tunis.,29
Carthage?,29
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath,29
What impossible matter will he make easy next?,29
and give it his son for an apple.,29
forth more islands.,29
Why in good time.,29
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage,29
And the rarest that e'er came there.,29
O widow Dido! ay widow Dido.,29
wore it? I mean in a sort.,29
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?,29
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never,29
My son is lost and in my rate she too,29
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir,29
Hath made his meal on thee?,29
I saw him beat the surges under him,29
Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted,29
Bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd,29
To the shore that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,29
He came alive to land.,29
Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss,29
But rather lose her to an African;,29
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.,29
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise,29
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at,29
son,29
More widows in them of this business' making,29
The fault's your own.,29
My lord Sebastian,29
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,29
Very well.,29
It is foul weather in us all good sir,29
Foul weather?,29
Had I plantation of this isle my lord--,29
Or docks or mallows.,29
Scape being drunk for want of wine.,29
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic,29
Letters should not be known; riches poverty,29
Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none;,29
No occupation; all men idle all;,29
No sovereignty;--,29
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the,29
All things in common nature should produce,29
Sword pike knife gun or need of any engine,29
Of its own kind all foison all abundance,29
No marrying 'mong his subjects?,29
I would with such perfection govern sir,29
God save his majesty!,29
And--do you mark me sir?,29
I do well believe your highness; and,29
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that,29
Twas you we laughed at.,29
to you: so you may continue and laugh at,29
What a blow was there given!,29
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift,29
in it five weeks without changing.,29
We would so and then go a bat-fowling.,29
No I warrant you; I will not adventure,29
me asleep for I am very heavy?,29
All sleep except ALONSO SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO,29
Would with themselves shut up my thoughts: I find,29
Please you sir,29
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,29
We two my lord,29
And watch your safety.,29
ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL,29
It is the quality o' the climate.,29
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not,29
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.,29
They dropp'd as by a thunder-stroke. What might,29
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,29
My strong imagination sees a crown,29
What art thou waking?,29
I do; and surely,29
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?,29
With eyes wide open; standing speaking moving,29
Noble Sebastian,29
Whiles thou art waking.,29
There's meaning in thy snores.,29
Must be so too if heed me; which to do,29
Well I am standing water.,29
Do so: to ebb,29
O,29
Whiles thus you mock it! how in stripping it,29
Most often do so near the bottom run,29
Prithee say on:,29
A matter from thee and a birth indeed,29
Thus sir:,29
Who shall be of as little memory,29
For he's a spirit of persuasion only,29
Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd,29
I have no hope,29
O out of that 'no hope',29
Another way so high a hope that even,29
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me,29
He's gone.,29
Who's the next heir of Naples?,29
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells,29
Can have no note unless the sun were post--,29
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?,29
And by that destiny to perform an act,29
In yours and my discharge.,29
Tis true my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;,29
There is some space.,29
Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel,29
And let Sebastian wake.' Say this were death,29
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples,29
As amply and unnecessarily,29
A chough of as deep chat. O that you bore,29
For your advancement! Do you understand me?,29
And how does your content,29
I remember,29
True:,29
Much feater than before: my brother's servants,29
But for your conscience?,29
Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not,29
That stand 'twixt me and Milan candied be they,29
No better than the earth he lies upon,29
Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it,29
To the perpetual wink for aye might put,29
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,29
They'll tell the clock to any business that,29
Thy case dear friend,29
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke,29
And I the king shall love thee.,29
And when I rear my hand do you the like,29
O but one word.,29
Re-enter ARIEL invisible,29
That you his friend are in; and sends me forth--,29
Sings in GONZALO's ear,29
Open-eyed conspiracy,29
If of life you keep a care,29
Awake awake!,29
Now good angels,29
They wake,29
Wherefore this ghastly looking?,29
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,29
Like bulls or rather lions: did't not wake you?,29
I heard nothing.,29
To make an earthquake! sure it was the roar,29
Heard you this Gonzalo?,29
And that a strange one too which did awake me:,29
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,29
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.,29
For my poor son.,29
For he is sure i' the island.,29
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:,29
Exeunt,29
Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard,29
From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him,29
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,29
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark,29
For every trifle are they set upon me;,29
And after bite me then like hedgehogs which,29
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I,29
Do hiss me into madness.,29
Lo now lo!,29
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;,29
Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off,29
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black,29
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it,29
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot,29
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:,29
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-,29
as once I was and had but this fish painted,29
of silver: there would this monster make a,29
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame,29
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like,29
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,29
thunderbolt.,29
Alas the storm is come again! my best way is to,29
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with,29
dregs of the storm be past.,29
I shall no more to sea to sea,29
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's,29
Drinks,29
The master the swabber the boatswain and I,29
Loved Mall Meg and Marian and Margery,29
For she had a tongue with a tang,29
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,29
Then to sea boys and let her go hang!,29
Drinks,29
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put,29
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your,29
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;,29
breathes at's nostrils.,29
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who,29
should he learn our language? I will give him some,29
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him he's a,29
Do not torment me prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.,29
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have,29
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame I will,29
hath him and that soundly.,29
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.,29
which will give language to you cat: open your,29
and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:,29
I should know that voice: it should be--but he is,29
Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!,29
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches,29
recover him I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I,29
Stephano!,29
a devil and no monster: I will leave him; I have no,29
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano touch me and,29
good friend Trinculo.,29
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,29
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can,29
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But,29
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me,29
the storm. And art thou living Stephano? O,29
Prithee do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.,29
not sprites.,29
I will kneel to him.,29
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I,29
heaved o'erboard by this bottle; which I made of,29
cast ashore.,29
for the liquor is not earthly.,29
Swum ashore. man like a duck: I can swim like a,29
Here kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a,29
O Stephano. hast any more of this?,29
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now moon-calf!,29
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?,29
the moon when time was.,29
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.,29
it anon with new contents swear.,29
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i',29
drawn monster in good sooth!,29
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee be my god.,29
monster! when 's god's asleep he'll rob his bottle.,29
Come on then; down and swear.,29
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my,29
Come kiss.,29
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;,29
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!,29
Thou wondrous man.,29
Poor drunkard!,29
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;,29
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee,29
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?,29
talking. Trinculo the king and all our company,29
bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo we'll fill him by,29
[Sings drunkenly],29
A howling monster: a drunken monster!,29
Nor fetch in firing,29
Nor scrape trencher nor wash dish,29
Has a new master: get a new man.,29
hey-day freedom!,29
Exeunt,29
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.,29
There be some sports are painful and their labour,29
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters,29
Would be as heavy to me as odious but,29
And makes my labours pleasures: O she is,29
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove,29
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress,29
Had never like executor. I forget:,29
Most busy lest when I do it.,29
Alas now pray you,29
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!,29
Twill weep for having wearied you. My father,29
He's safe for these three hours.,29
The sun will set before I shall discharge,29
If you'll sit down,29
I'll carry it to the pile.,29
I had rather crack my sinews break my back,29
While I sit lazy by.,29
As well as it does you: and I should do it,29
And yours it is against.,29
This visitation shows it.,29
No noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me,29
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--,29
Miranda.--O my father,29
Admired Miranda!,29
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady,29
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage,29
Have I liked several women; never any,29
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,29
So perfect and so peerless are created,29
I do not know,29
Save from my glass mine own; nor have I seen,29
And my dear father: how features are abroad,29
The jewel in my dower I would not wish,29
Nor can imagination form a shape,29
Something too wildly and my father's precepts,29
I am in my condition,29
I would not so!--and would no more endure,29
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:,29
My heart fly to your service; there resides,29
Am I this patient log--man.,29
O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound,29
If I speak true! if hollowly invert,29
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world,29
I am a fool,29
Fair encounter,29
On that which breeds between 'em!,29
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer,29
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;,29
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence bashful cunning!,29
I am your wife if you will marry me;,29
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,29
My mistress dearest;,29
My husband then?,29
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.,29
Till half an hour hence.,29
Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally,29
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing,29
For yet ere supper-time must I perform,29
Exit,29
Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO,29
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up and,29
Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They,29
of them; if th' other two be brained like us the,29
Drink servant-monster when I bid thee: thy eyes,29
Where should they be set else? he were a brave,29
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:,29
could recover the shore five and thirty leagues off,29
monster or my standard.,29
We'll not run Monsieur Monster.,29
nothing neither.,29
good moon-calf.,29
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.,29
justle a constable. Why thou deboshed fish thou,29
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,29
Lo how he mocks me! wilt thou let him my lord?,29
Lo lo again! bite him to death I prithee.,29
prove a mutineer--the next tree! The poor monster's,29
I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to,29
Marry will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,29
Enter ARIEL invisible,29
sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.,29
Thou liest thou jesting monkey thou: I would my,29
Trinculo if you trouble him any more in's tale by,29
Why I said nothing.,29
I say by sorcery he got this isle;,29
Revenge it on him--for I know thou darest,29
That's most certain.,29
How now shall this be compassed?,29
Yea yea my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,29
Thou liest; thou canst not.,29
I do beseech thy greatness give him blows,29
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him,29
Trinculo run into no further danger:,29
by this hand I'll turn my mercy out o' doors,29
Why what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther,29
Didst thou not say he lied?,29
Do I so? take thou that.,29
As you like this give me the lie another time.,29
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!,29
your monster and the devil take your fingers!,29
Now forward with your tale. Prithee stand farther,29
Beat him enough: after a little time,29
Stand farther. Come proceed.,29
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,29
Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake,29
First to possess his books; for without them,29
One spirit to command: they all do hate him,29
He has brave utensils--for so he calls them--,29
And that most deeply to consider is,29
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,29
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax,29
Is it so brave a lass?,29
And bring thee forth brave brood.,29
will be king and queen--save our graces!--and,29
like the plot Trinculo?,29
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,29
Within this half hour will he be asleep:,29
Ay on mine honour.,29
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:,29
You taught me but while-ere?,29
reason. Come on Trinculo let us sing.,29
Flout 'em and scout 'em,29
Thought is free.,29
Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe,29
This is the tune of our catch played by the picture,29
If thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness:,29
O forgive me my sins!,29
Art thou afeard?,29
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,29
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments,29
That if I then had waked after long sleep,29
The clouds methought would open and show riches,29
I cried to dream again.,29
have my music for nothing.,29
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.,29
after do our work.,29
this tabourer; he lays it on.,29
Exeunt,29
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and others,29
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed,29
I needs must rest me.,29
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,29
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it,29
Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks,29
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so,29
Do not for one repulse forego the purpose,29
[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage,29
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;,29
Will not nor cannot use such vigilance,29
[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say to-night: no more.,29
What harmony is this? My good friends hark!,29
Enter PROSPERO above invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes bringing in a banquet;  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation; and inviting the King  and c. to eat they depart,29
A living drollery. Now I will believe,29
There is one tree the phoenix' throne one phoenix,29
I'll believe both;,29
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did,29
Though fools at home condemn 'em.,29
I should report this now would they believe me?,29
For certes these are people of the island--,29
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of,29
Many nay almost any.,29
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present,29
I cannot too much muse,29
Although they want the use of tongue a kind,29
[Aside] Praise in departing.,29
No matter since,29
Will't please you taste of what is here?,29
Faith sir you need not fear. When we were boys,29
Dew-lapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at 'em,29
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find,29
Good warrant of.,29
Although my last: no matter since I feel,29
Stand to and do as we.,29
You are three men of sin whom Destiny,29
And what is in't the never-surfeited sea,29
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men,29
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown,29
ALONSO SEBASTIAN  and c. draw their swords,29
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,29
Wound the loud winds or with bemock'd-at stabs,29
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers,29
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,29
For that's my business to you--that you three,29
Exposed unto the sea which hath requit it,29
The powers delaying not forgetting have,29
Against your peace. Thee of thy son Alonso,29
Lingering perdition worse than any death,29
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--,29
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow,29
He vanishes in thunder; then to soft music  enter the Shapes again and dance with mocks and mows and carrying out the table,29
Perform'd my Ariel; a grace it had devouring:,29
In what thou hadst to say: so with good life,29
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,29
In their distractions; they now are in my power;,29
Young Ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd,29
Exit above,29
In this strange stare?,29
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;,29
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe pronounced,29
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded and,29
And with him there lie mudded.,29
But one fiend at a time,29
I'll be thy second.,29
All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,29
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you,29
And hinder them from what this ecstasy,29
Follow I pray you.,29
ACT IV,29
Enter PROSPERO FERDINAND and MIRANDA,29
Your compensation makes amends for I,29
Or that for which I live; who once again,29
Were but my trials of thy love and thou,29
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,29
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,29
I do believe it,29
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition,29
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before,29
With full and holy rite be minister'd,29
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,29
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly,29
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.,29
For quiet days fair issue and long life,29
The most opportune place the strong'st suggestion.,29
Mine honour into lust to take away,29
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,29
Fairly spoke.,29
What Ariel! my industrious servant Ariel!,29
What would my potent master? here I am.,29
Did worthily perform; and I must use you,29
O'er whom I give thee power here to this place:,29
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple,29
And they expect it from me.,29
Ay with a twink.,29
And breathe twice and cry 'so so',29
Will be here with mop and mow.,29
Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach,29
Well I conceive.,29
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance,29
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,29
I warrant you sir;,29
Abates the ardour of my liver.,29
Now come my Ariel! bring a corollary,29
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.,29
Enter IRIS,29
Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease;,29
And flat meads thatch'd with stover them to keep;,29
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,29
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,29
And thy sea-marge sterile and rocky-hard,29
Whose watery arch and messenger am I,29
Here on this grass-plot in this very place,29
Approach rich Ceres her to entertain.,29
Hail many-colour'd messenger that ne'er,29
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers,29
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown,29
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen,29
A contract of true love to celebrate;,29
On the blest lovers.,29
If Venus or her son as thou dost know,29
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,29
I have forsworn.,29
Be not afraid: I met her deity,29
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done,29
Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid,29
Mars's hot minion is returned again;,29
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows,29
High'st queen of state,29
Enter JUNO,29
To bless this twain that they may prosperous be,29
They sing:,29
Long continuance and increasing,29
Juno sings her blessings upon you.,29
Barns and garners never empty,29
Plants with goodly burthen bowing;,29
In the very end of harvest!,29
Ceres' blessing so is on you.,29
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold,29
Spirits which by mine art,29
My present fancies.,29
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife,29
Juno and Ceres whisper and send Iris on employment,29
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;,29
Or else our spell is marr'd.,29
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,29
Answer your summons; Juno does command:,29
A contract of true love; be not too late.,29
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary,29
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,29
In country footing.,29
[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy,29
Against my life: the minute of their plot,29
To the Spirits,29
This is strange: your father's in some passion,29
Never till this day,29
You do look my son in a moved sort,29
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,29
Are melted into air into thin air:,29
The cloud-capp'd towers the gorgeous palaces,29
Ye all which it inherit shall dissolve,29
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff,29
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir I am vex'd;,29
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:,29
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,29
We wish your peace.,29
Come with a thought I thank thee Ariel: come.,29
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?,29
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.,29
I thought to have told thee of it but I fear'd,29
Say again where didst thou leave these varlets?,29
So fun of valour that they smote the air,29
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending,29
At which like unback'd colts they prick'd,29
Advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses,29
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through,29
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them,29
There dancing up to the chins that the foul lake,29
This was well done my bird.,29
The trumpery in my house go bring it hither,29
I go I go.,29
A devil a born devil on whose nature,29
Humanely taken all all lost quite lost;,29
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,29
Re-enter ARIEL loaden with glistering apparel  and c,29
PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO all wet,29
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.,29
a harmless fairy has done little better than,29
Monster I do smell all horse-piss; at,29
So is mine. Do you hear monster? If I should take,29
Thou wert but a lost monster.,29
Be patient for the prize I'll bring thee to,29
All's hush'd as midnight yet.,29
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,29
That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your,29
I will fetch off my bottle though I be o'er ears,29
Prithee my king be quiet. Seest thou here,29
Do that good mischief which may make this island,29
For aye thy foot-licker.,29
O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look,29
Let it alone thou fool; it is but trash.,29
O king Stephano!,29
that gown.,29
The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean,29
And do the murder first: if he awake,29
Make us strange stuff.,29
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under,29
hair and prove a bald jerkin.,29
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:,29
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent,29
Monster come put some lime upon your fingers and,29
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,29
With foreheads villanous low.,29
away where my hogshead of wine is or I'll turn you,29
And this.,29
A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits  in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on,29
Silver I there it goes Silver!,29
CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO are driven out,29
With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews,29
Than pard or cat o' mountain.,29
Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour,29
Shortly shall all my labours end and thou,29
Follow and do me service.,29
ACT V,29
Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes and ARIEL,29
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time,29
On the sixth hour; at which time my lord,29
I did say so,29
How fares the king and's followers?,29
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,29
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;,29
His brother and yours abide all three distracted,29
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly,29
His tears run down his beard like winter's drops,29
That if you now beheld them your affections,29
Dost thou think so spirit?,29
And mine shall.,29
Of their afflictions and shall not myself,29
Passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art?,29
Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury,29
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,29
Not a frown further. Go release them Ariel:,29
And they shall be themselves.,29
Exit,29
And ye that on the sands with printless foot,29
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that,29
Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime,29
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,29
The noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds,29
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder,29
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory,29
The pine and cedar: graves at my command,29
By my so potent art. But this rough magic,29
Some heavenly music which even now I do,29
This airy charm is for I'll break my staff,29
And deeper than did ever plummet sound,29
Solemn music,29
A solemn air and the best comforter,29
Now useless boil'd within thy skull! There stand,29
Holy Gonzalo honourable man,29
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,29
Melting the darkness so their rising senses,29
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,29
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces,29
Didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter:,29
Thou art pinch'd fort now Sebastian. Flesh and blood,29
Expell'd remorse and nature; who with Sebastian,29
Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,29
Begins to swell and the approaching tide,29
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them,29
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:,29
As I was sometime Milan: quickly spirit;,29
ARIEL sings and helps to attire him,29
In a cowslip's bell I lie;,29
On the bat's back I do fly,29
Merrily merrily shall I live now,29
Why that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:,29
To the king's ship invisible as thou art:,29
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain,29
And presently I prithee.,29
Or ere your pulse twice beat.,29
All torment trouble wonder and amazement,29
Out of this fearful country!,29
The wronged Duke of Milan Prospero:,29
Does now speak to thee I embrace thy body;,29
A hearty welcome.,29
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,29
Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,29
I fear a madness held me: this must crave,29
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat,29
Be living and be here?,29
Let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot,29
Whether this be,29
You do yet taste,29
Believe things certain. Welcome my friends all!,29
But you my brace of lords were I so minded,29
And justify you traitors: at this time,29
[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.,29
For you most wicked sir whom to call brother,29
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require,29
Thou must restore.,29
Give us particulars of thy preservation;,29
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--,29
My dear son Ferdinand.,29
Irreparable is the loss and patience,29
I rather think,29
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,29
You the like loss!,29
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker,29
Have lost my daughter.,29
O heavens that they were living both in Naples,29
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed,29
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords,29
That they devour their reason and scarce think,29
Are natural breath: but howsoe'er you have,29
That I am Prospero and that very duke,29
Upon this shore where you were wreck'd was landed,29
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,29
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome sir;,29
And subjects none abroad: pray you look in.,29
I will requite you with as good a thing;,29
As much as me my dukedom.,29
Sweet lord you play me false.,29
I would not for the world.,29
And I would call it fair play.,29
A vision of the Island one dear son,29
A most high miracle!,29
I have cursed them without cause.,29
Now all the blessings,29
Arise and say how thou camest here.,29
How many goodly creatures are there here!,29
That has such people in't!,29
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?,29
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,29
Sir she is mortal;,29
I chose her when I could not ask my father,29
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,29
But never saw before; of whom I have,29
This lady makes him to me.,29
But O how oddly will it sound that I,29
There sir stop:,29
A heaviness that's gone.,29
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down you god,29
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way,29
I say Amen Gonzalo!,29
Should become kings of Naples? O rejoice,29
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage,29
And Ferdinand her brother found a wife,29
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves,29
[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:,29
That doth not wish you joy!,29
Re-enter ARIEL with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following,29
I prophesied if a gallows were on land,29
That swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore?,29
The best news is that we have safely found,29
Which but three glasses since we gave out split--,29
We first put out to sea.,29
Have I done since I went.,29
These are not natural events; they strengthen,29
If I did think sir I were well awake,29
And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;,29
Of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains,29
We were awaked; straightway at liberty;,29
Our royal good and gallant ship our master,29
Even in a dream were we divided from them,29
[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?,29
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod,29
Was ever conduct of: some oracle,29
Sir my liege,29
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,29
Which to you shall seem probable of every,29
And think of each thing well.,29
Come hither spirit:,29
Untie the spell.,29
How fares my gracious sir?,29
Some few odd lads that you remember not.,29
Every man shift for all the rest and,29
but fortune. Coragio bully-monster coragio!,29
here's a goodly sight.,29
How fine my master is! I am afraid,29
Ha ha!,29
Will money buy 'em?,29
Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.,29
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,29
That could control the moon make flows and ebbs,29
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--,29
To take my life. Two of these fellows you,29
Acknowledge mine.,29
Is not this Stephano my drunken butler?,29
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they,29
How camest thou in this pickle?,29
saw you last that I fear me will never out of,29
Why how now Stephano!,29
You'ld be king o' the isle sirrah?,29
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.,29
He is as disproportion'd in his manners,29
Take with you your companions; as you look,29
Ay that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter,29
Was I to take this drunkard for a god,29
Go to; away!,29
Or stole it rather.,29
Sir I invite your highness and your train,29
For this one night; which part of it I'll waste,29
Go quick away; the story of my life,29
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn,29
Where I have hope to see the nuptial,29
And thence retire me to my Milan where,29
I long,29
Take the ear strangely.,29
And promise you calm seas auspicious gales,29
Your royal fleet far off.,29
My Ariel chick,29
Be free and fare thou well! Please you draw near.,29
EPILOGUE,29
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,29
Which is most faint: now 'tis true,29
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,29
And pardon'd the deceiver dwell,29
But release me from my bands,29
Gentle breath of yours my sails,29
Which was to please. Now I want,29
And my ending is despair,29
Which pierces so that it assaults,29
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,29
ACT I,30
Enter Poet Painter Jeweller Merchant and others at several doors,30
I am glad you're well.,30
It wears sir as it grows.,30
But what particular rarity? what strange,30
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power,30
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.,30
Nay that's most fix'd.,30
To an untirable and continuate goodness:,30
Jeweller: I have a jewel here--,30
Jeweller: If he will touch the estimate: but for that--,30
praised the vile,30
Which aptly sings the good.',30
Looking at the jewel,30
You are rapt sir in some work some dedication,30
A thing slipp'd idly from me.,30
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint,30
Provokes itself and like the current flies,30
A picture sir. When comes your book forth?,30
Let's see your piece.,30
So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.,30
Admirable: how this grace,30
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination,30
One might interpret.,30
Here is a touch; is't good?,30
It tutors nature: artificial strife,30
Enter certain Senators and pass over,30
The senators of Athens: happy man!,30
You see this confluence this great flood,30
I have in this rough work shaped out a man,30
With amplest entertainment: my free drift,30
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice,30
But flies an eagle flight bold and forth on,30
How shall I understand you?,30
You see how all conditions how all minds,30
Of grave and austere quality tender down,30
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,30
All sorts of hearts; yea from the glass-faced flatterer,30
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down,30
Most rich in Timon's nod.,30
Sir I have upon a high and pleasant hill,30
Is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures,30
To propagate their states: amongst them all,30
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,30
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants,30
Tis conceived to scope.,30
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,30
To climb his happiness would be well express'd,30
Nay sir but hear me on.,30
Some better than his value on the moment,30
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,30
Drink the free air.,30
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood,30
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top,30
Not one accompanying his declining foot.,30
A thousand moral paintings I can show,30
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well,30
The foot above the head.,30
Imprison'd is he say you?,30
His means most short his creditors most strait:,30
To those have shut him up; which failing,30
Noble Ventidius! Well;,30
My friend when he must need me. I do know him,30
Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,30
Your lordship ever binds him.,30
And being enfranchised bid him come to me.,30
But to support him after. Fare you well.,30
Exit,30
Lord Timon hear me speak.,30
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.,30
Most noble Timon call the man before thee.,30
Here at your lordship's service.,30
By night frequents my house. I am a man,30
And my estate deserves an heir more raised,30
Well; what further?,30
On whom I may confer what I have got:,30
And I have bred her at my dearest cost,30
Attempts her love: I prithee noble lord,30
Myself have spoke in vain.,30
Therefore he will be Timon:,30
It must not bear my daughter.,30
She is young and apt:,30
What levity's in youth.,30
Ay my good lord and she accepts of it.,30
I call the gods to witness I will choose,30
And dispossess her all.,30
if she be mated with an equal husband?,30
This gentleman of mine hath served me long:,30
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:,30
And make him weigh with her.,30
Pawn me to this your honour she is his.,30
Humbly I thank your lordship: never may,30
Which is not owed to you!,30
Vouchsafe my labour and long live your lordship!,30
Go not away. What have you there my friend?,30
Your lordship to accept.,30
The painting is almost the natural man;,30
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are,30
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance,30
The gods preserve ye!,30
We must needs dine together. Sir your jewel,30
What my lord! dispraise?,30
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,30
My lord 'tis rated,30
Things of like value differing in the owners,30
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.,30
No my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,30
Look who comes here: will you be chid?,30
Jeweller: We'll bear with your lordship.,30
Good morrow to thee gentle Apemantus!,30
When thou art Timon's dog and these knaves honest.,30
Are they not Athenians?,30
Then I repent not.,30
Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.,30
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.,30
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.,30
Right if doing nothing be death by the law.,30
The best for the innocence.,30
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet,30
You're a dog.,30
Wilt dine with me Apemantus?,30
An thou shouldst thou 'ldst anger ladies.,30
That's a lascivious apprehension.,30
How dost thou like this jewel Apemantus?,30
man a doit.,30
Not worth my thinking. How now poet!,30
Thou liest.,30
Yes.,30
Art not a poet?,30
Then thou liest: look in thy last work where thou,30
That's not feigned; he is so.,30
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o',30
What wouldst do then Apemantus?,30
What thyself?,30
Wherefore?,30
Art not thou a merchant?,30
Traffic confound thee if the gods will not!,30
Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!,30
What trumpet's that?,30
All of companionship.,30
Exeunt some Attendants,30
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,30
Enter ALCIBIADES with the rest,30
So so there!,30
That there should be small love 'mongst these,30
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out,30
Sir you have saved my longing and I feed,30
Right welcome sir!,30
In different pleasures. Pray you let us in.,30
Enter two Lords,30
Time to be honest.,30
The more accursed thou that still omitt'st it.,30
Ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.,30
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.,30
Shouldst have kept one to thyself for I mean to,30
Hang thyself!,30
requests to thy friend.,30
I will fly like a dog the heels o' the ass.,30
He's opposite to humanity. Come shall we in,30
The very heart of kindness.,30
Is but his steward: no meed but he repays,30
But breeds the giver a return exceeding,30
The noblest mind he carries,30
Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?,30
Exeunt,30
Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON ALCIBIADES Lords Senators and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes dropping after all APEMANTUS discontentedly like himself,30
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,30
He is gone happy and has left me rich:,30
To your free heart I do return those talents,30
I derived liberty.,30
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:,30
Can truly say he gives if he receives:,30
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.,30
Nay my lords,30
Ceremony was but devised at first,30
Recanting goodness sorry ere 'tis shown;,30
Pray sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes,30
They sit,30
Ho ho confess'd it! hang'd it have you not?,30
No;,30
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.,30
Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.,30
man is ever angry. Go let him have a table by,30
he fit for't indeed.,30
observe; I give thee warning on't.,30
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;,30
I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me for I should,30
men eat Timon and he sees 'em not! It grieves me,30
and all the madness is he cheers them up too.,30
Methinks they should invite them without knives;,30
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits,30
breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest,30
huge man I should fear to drink at meals;,30
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.,30
Let it flow this way my good lord.,30
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state,30
be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i' the mire:,30
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.,30
Immortal gods I crave no pelf;,30
Grant I may never prove so fond,30
Or a harlot for her weeping;,30
Or a keeper with my freedom;,30
Amen. So fall to't:,30
Eats and drinks,30
Captain Alcibiades your heart's in the field now.,30
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a,30
So the were bleeding-new my lord there's no meat,30
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,30
Might we but have that happiness my lord that you,30
some part of our zeals we should think ourselves,30
O no doubt my good friends but the gods,30
from you: how had you been my friends else? why,30
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told,30
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm,30
friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they,30
ne'er have use for 'em and would most resemble,30
sounds to themselves. Why I have often wished,30
are born to do benefits: and what better or,30
friends? O what a precious comfort 'tis to have,30
fortunes! O joy e'en made away ere 't can be born!,30
forget their faults I drink to you.,30
Joy had the like conception in our eyes,30
Ho ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.,30
Much!,30
What means that trump?,30
How now?,30
ladies most desirous of admittance.,30
There comes with them a forerunner my lord which,30
I pray let them be admitted.,30
Hail to thee worthy Timon and to all,30
Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely,30
Taste touch and smell pleased from thy tale rise;,30
They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:,30
Exit Cupid,30
Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playing,30
They dance! they are mad women.,30
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.,30
And spend our flatteries to drink those men,30
With poisonous spite and envy.,30
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves,30
I should fear those that dance before me now,30
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.,30
You have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies,30
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;,30
And entertain'd me with mine own device;,30
My lord you take us even at the best.,30
taking I doubt me.,30
Please you to dispose yourselves.,30
Exeunt Cupid and Ladies,30
My lord?,30
Yes my lord. More jewels yet!,30
Aside,30
When all's spent he 'ld be cross'd then an he could.,30
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.,30
Where be our men?,30
Our horses!,30
O my friends,30
I must entreat you honour me so much,30
Kind my lord.,30
So are we all.,30
My lord there are certain nobles of the senate,30
They are fairly welcome.,30
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.,30
I prithee let's be provided to show them,30
[Aside]  I scarce know how.,30
May it please your honour Lord Lucius,30
Four milk-white horses trapp'd in silver.,30
Be worthily entertain'd.,30
How now! what news?,30
gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company,30
two brace of greyhounds.,30
Not without fair reward.,30
He commands us to provide and give great gifts,30
Nor will he know his purse or yield me this,30
Being of no power to make his wishes good:,30
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes,30
Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.,30
Before I were forced out!,30
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.,30
Exit,30
Much wrong you bate too much of your own merits:,30
With more than common thanks I will receive it.,30
And now I remember my lord you gave,30
I rode on: it is yours because you liked it.,30
You may take my word my lord; I know no man,30
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;,30
O none so welcome.,30
So kind to heart 'tis not enough to give;,30
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,30
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living,30
Lie in a pitch'd field.,30
We are so virtuously bound--,30
Am I to you.,30
All to you. Lights more lights!,30
Honour and fortunes keep with you Lord Timon!,30
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON,30
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!,30
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:,30
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.,30
good to thee.,30
there would be none left to rail upon thee and then,30
Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in,30
vain-glories?,30
sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come,30
Exit,30
Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:,30
O that men's ears should be,30
Exit,30
SCENE I. A Senator's house.,30
And late five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore,30
Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion,30
If I want gold steal but a beggar's dog,30
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more,30
Ask nothing give it him it foals me straight,30
But rather one that smiles and still invites,30
Can found his state in safety. Caphis ho!,30
Enter CAPHIS,30
Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon;,30
With slight denial nor then silenced when--,30
Plays in the right hand thus: but tell him,30
Out of mine own; his days and times are past,30
Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,30
Immediate are my needs and my relief,30
But find supply immediate. Get you gone:,30
A visage of demand; for I do fear,30
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,30
I go sir.,30
And have the dates in contempt.,30
Go.,30
SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon's house.,30
No care no stop! so senseless of expense,30
Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account,30
Of what is to continue: never mind,30
What shall be done? he will not hear till feel:,30
Fie fie fie fie!,30
Good even Varro: what,30
Varro's Servant Is't not your business too?,30
Isidore's Servant It is so.,30
Varro's Servant I fear it.,30
Enter TIMON ALCIBIADES and Lords  and c,30
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?,30
Dues! Whence are you?,30
Go to my steward.,30
To the succession of new days this month:,30
To call upon his own and humbly prays you,30
In giving him his right.,30
I prithee but repair to me next morning.,30
Contain thyself good friend.,30
Isidore's Servant From Isidore;,30
If you did know my lord my master's wants--,30
Isidore's Servant          Your steward puts me off my lord;,30
Give me breath.,30
I'll wait upon you instantly.,30
To FLAVIUS,30
How goes the world that I am thus encounter'd,30
And the detention of long-since-due debts,30
Please you gentlemen,30
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,30
Wherefore you are not paid.,30
Exit,30
Exit,30
Stay stay here comes the fool with Apemantus:,30
Varro's Servant Hang him he'll abuse us.,30
Varro's Servant How dost fool?,30
Varro's Servant I speak not to thee.,30
To the Fool,30
Isidore's Servant There's the fool hangs on your back already.,30
Where's the fool now?,30
usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!,30
Asses.,30
That you ask me what you are and do not know,30
How do you gentlemen?,30
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens,30
Good! gramercy.,30
Look you here comes my mistress' page.,30
in this wise company? How dost thou Apemantus?,30
thee profitably.,30
these letters: I know not which is which.,30
No.,30
art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to,30
die a bawd.,30
dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.,30
E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool I will go with,30
Will you leave me there?,30
Ay; would they served us!,30
Are you three usurers' men?,30
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my,30
to borrow of your masters they approach sadly and,30
merrily and go away sadly: the reason of this?,30
Do it then that we may account thee a whoremaster,30
no less esteemed.,30
A fool in good clothes and something like thee.,30
sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,30
very often like a knight; and generally in all,30
to thirteen this spirit walks in.,30
Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as,30
That answer might have become Apemantus.,30
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS,30
I do not always follow lover elder brother and,30
Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool,30
Exeunt Servants,30
Had you not fully laid my state before me,30
As I had leave of means?,30
At many leisures I proposed.,30
Perchance some single vantages you took.,30
And that unaptness made your minister,30
O my good lord,30
Laid them before you; you would throw them off,30
When for some trifling present you have bid me,30
Yea 'gainst the authority of manners pray'd you,30
Not seldom nor no slight cheques when I have,30
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,30
The greatest of your having lacks a half,30
Let all my land be sold.,30
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth,30
What shall defend the interim? and at length,30
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.,30
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,30
You tell me true.,30
Call me before the exactest auditors,30
When all our offices have been oppress'd,30
With drunken spilth of wine when every room,30
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,30
Prithee no more.,30
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants,30
What heart head sword force means but is,30
Great Timon noble worthy royal Timon!,30
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:,30
These flies are couch'd.,30
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;,30
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,30
If I would broach the vessels of my love,30
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use,30
Assurance bless your thoughts!,30
That I account them blessings; for by these,30
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.,30
Enter FLAMINIUS SERVILIUS and other Servants,30
I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;,30
to-day: you to Sempronius: commend me to their,30
found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let,30
As you have said my lord.,30
Go you sir to the senators--,30
Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant,30
I have been bold--,30
To them to use your signet and your name;,30
No richer in return.,30
They answer in a joint and corporate voice,30
Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable--,30
Something hath been amiss--a noble nature,30
And so intending other serious matters,30
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods,30
You gods reward them!,30
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:,30
Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;,30
Is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy.,30
Go to Ventidius.,30
Prithee be not sad,30
No blame belongs to thee.,30
Ventidius lately,30
Into a great estate: when he was poor,30
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;,30
Touches his friend which craves to be remember'd,30
Exit Servant,30
That had give't these fellows,30
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.,30
bounty's foe;,30
Exeunt,30
SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.,30
I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.,30
Enter LUCULLUS,30
[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift I,30
basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius honest,30
Fill me some wine.,30
And how does that honourable complete free-hearted,30
and master?,30
I am right glad that his health is well sir: and,30
Faith nothing but an empty box sir; which in my,30
supply; who having great and instant occasion to,30
furnish him nothing doubting your present,30
La la la la! 'nothing doubting' says he? Alas,30
keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha',30
supper to him of purpose to have him spend less,30
by my coming. Every man has his fault and honesty,30
him from't.,30
Please your lordship here is the wine.,30
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.,30
spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what,30
the time use thee well: good parts in thee.,30
Get you gone sirrah.,30
Draw nearer honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a,30
knowest well enough although thou comest to me,30
bare friendship without security. Here's three,30
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.,30
And we alive that lived? Fly damned baseness,30
Throwing the money back,30
Exit,30
Let moulten coin be thy damnation,30
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,30
I feel master's passion! this slave,30
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,30
O may diseases only work upon't!,30
Which my lord paid for be of any power,30
Exit,30
Enter LUCILIUS with three Strangers,30
an honourable gentleman.,30
to him. But I can tell you one thing my lord and,30
happy hours are done and past and his estate,30
Fie no do not believe it; he cannot want for money.,30
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow,30
showed what necessity belonged to't and yet was denied.,30
I tell you denied my lord.,30
I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!,30
part I must needs confess I have received some,30
and such-like trifles nothing comparing to his;,30
ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.,30
See by good hap yonder's my lord;,30
To LUCIUS,30
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very,30
May it please your honour my lord hath sent--,30
that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank,30
Has only sent his present occasion now my lord;,30
with so many talents.,30
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.,30
If his occasion were not virtuous,30
Dost thou speak seriously Servilius?,30
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself,30
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened that I,30
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius now,30
beast I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon,30
not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now.,30
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,30
this from me I count it one of my greatest,30
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius will you,30
Yes sir I shall.,30
Exit SERVILIUS,30
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.,30
Do you observe this Hostilius?,30
Why this is the world's soul; and just of the,30
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him,30
My knowing Timon has been this lord's father,30
Supported his estate; nay Timon's money,30
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;,30
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--,30
What charitable men afford to beggars.,30
For mine own part,30
Nor came any of his bounties over me,30
For his right noble mind illustrious virtue,30
Had his necessity made use of me,30
And the best half should have return'd to him,30
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;,30
Exeunt,30
Enter SEMPRONIUS and a Servant of TIMON's,30
all others?,30
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,30
Owe their estates unto him.,30
They have all been touch'd and found base metal for,30
How! have they denied him?,30
And does he send to me? Three? hum!,30
Must I be his last refuge! His friends like,30
Thrive give him over: must I take the cure upon me?,30
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,30
For in my conscience I was the first man,30
And does he think so backwardly of me now,30
So it may prove an argument of laughter,30
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,30
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,30
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.,30
Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The,30
politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot,30
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to,30
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set,30
politic love.,30
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,30
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd,30
And this is all a liberal course allows;,30
Exit,30
Enter two Servants of Varro and the Servant of  LUCIUS meeting TITUS HORTENSIUS and other Servants of TIMON's creditors waiting his coming out,30
Well met; good morrow Titus and Hortensius.,30
Lucius!,30
Lucilius' Servant Ay and I think,30
So is theirs and ours.,30
Lucilius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!,30
Lucilius' Servant                   Welcome good brother.,30
Labouring for nine.,30
Is not my lord seen yet?,30
I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.,30
You must consider that a prodigal course,30
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;,30
Find little.,30
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.,30
Most true he does.,30
For which I wait for money.,30
Lucilius' Servant Mark how strange it shows,30
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,30
I'm weary of this charge the gods can witness:,30
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.,30
Yes mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?,30
Varro's,30
Your master's confidence was above mine;,30
Enter FLAMINIUS.,30
Lucilius' Servant Flaminius! Sir a word: pray is my lord ready to,30
No indeed he is not.,30
I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.,30
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak muffled,30
He goes away in a cloud: call him call him.,30
Varro's,30
What do ye ask of me my friend?,30
Ay,30
Twere sure enough.,30
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?,30
And take down the interest into their,30
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;,30
Believe 't my lord and I have made an end;,30
Lucilius' Servant Ay but this answer will not serve.,30
For you serve knaves.,30
Varro's,30
Varro's,30
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no,30
great buildings.,30
O here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.,30
other hour I should derive much from't; for,30
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;,30
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:,30
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,30
Good gods!,30
[Within]  Servilius help! My lord! my lord!,30
What are my doors opposed against my passage?,30
Be my retentive enemy my gaol?,30
Like all mankind show me an iron heart?,30
My lord here is my bill.,30
And mine my lord.,30
Varro's Servants And ours my lord.,30
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.,30
Cut my heart in sums.,30
Tell out my blood.,30
Five thousand drops pays that.,30
Varro's,30
Varro's,30
Tear me take me and the gods fall upon you!,30
Faith I perceive our masters may throw their caps,30
desperate ones for a madman owes 'em.,30
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS,30
Creditors? devils!,30
What if it should be so?,30
I'll have it so. My steward!,30
So fitly? Go bid all my friends again,30
All sirrah all:,30
O my lord,30
There is not so much left to furnish out,30
Be't not in thy care; go,30
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.,30
SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.,30
Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:,30
Most true; the law shall bruise him.,30
Honour health and compassion to the senate!,30
I am an humble suitor to your virtues;,30
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.,30
Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood,30
To those that without heed do plunge into 't.,30
Of comely virtues:,30
An honour in him which buys out his fault--,30
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,30
And with such sober and unnoted passion,30
As if he had but proved an argument.,30
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:,30
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling,30
Is valour misbegot and came into the world,30
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer,30
His outsides to wear them like his raiment,30
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,30
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,30
My lord--,30
To revenge is no valour but to bear.,30
If I speak like a captain.,30
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,30
Without repugnancy? If there be,30
Abroad? why then women are more valiant,30
And the ass more captain than the lion the felon,30
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,30
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?,30
But in defence by mercy 'tis most just.,30
But who is man that is not angry?,30
You breathe in vain.,30
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium,30
What's that?,30
And slain in fight many of your enemies:,30
In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds!,30
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often,30
If there were no foes that were enough,30
He has been known to commit outrages,30
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.,30
Hard fate! he might have died in war.,30
Though his right arm might purchase his own time,30
Take my deserts to his and join 'em both:,30
Security I'll pawn my victories all,30
If by this crime he owes the law his life,30
For law is strict and war is nothing more.,30
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,30
Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,30
How!,30
What!,30
It could not else be I should prove so base,30
My wounds ache at you.,30
Tis in few words but spacious in effect;,30
Banish me!,30
That makes the senate ugly.,30
Attend our weightier judgment. And not to swell,30
He shall be executed presently.,30
Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live,30
I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,30
Their coin upon large interest I myself,30
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate,30
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;,30
That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up,30
Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;,30
Exit,30
Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords Senators and others at several doors,30
I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord,30
Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we,30
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.,30
I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest,30
to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them and,30
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate,30
sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my,30
I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all,30
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of,30
A thousand pieces.,30
What of you?,30
Enter TIMON and Attendants,30
Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship.,30
your lordship.,30
summer-birds are men. Gentlemen our dinner will not,30
music awhile if they will fare so harshly o' the,30
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship,30
O sir let it not trouble you.,30
Ah my good friend what cheer?,30
that when your lordship this other day sent to me,30
Think not on 't sir.,30
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.,30
Come bring in all together.,30
Royal cheer I warrant you.,30
it.,30
Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?,30
Tis so be sure of it.,30
I pray you upon what?,30
I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.,30
Will 't hold? will 't hold?,30
I do conceive.,30
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all,30
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:,30
You great benefactors sprinkle our society with,30
praised: but reserve still to give lest your,30
one need not lend to another; for were your,30
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man,30
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at,30
rest of your fees O gods--the senators of Athens,30
amiss in them you gods make suitable for,30
are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to,30
Uncover dogs and lap.,30
What does his lordship mean?,30
May you a better feast never behold,30
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;,30
Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces,30
Throwing the water in their faces,30
Most smiling smooth detested parasites,30
You fools of fortune trencher-friends time's flies,30
Of man and beast the infinite malady,30
Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--,30
Throws the dishes at them and drives them out,30
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.,30
Of Timon man and all humanity!,30
Re-enter the Lords Senators  and c,30
Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?,30
I have lost my gown.,30
He gave me a jewel th' other day and now he has,30
Did you see my cap?,30
Here lies my gown.,30
Lord Timon's mad.,30
One day he gives us diamonds next day stones.,30
ACT IV,30
Enter TIMON,30
That girdlest in those wolves dive in the earth,30
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,30
And minister in their steads! to general filths,30
Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts hold fast;,30
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants steal!,30
And pill by law. Maid to thy master's bed;,30
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,30
Religion to the gods peace justice truth,30
Instruction manners mysteries and trades,30
Decline to your confounding contraries,30
Your potent and infectious fevers heap,30
Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt,30
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,30
And drown themselves in riot! Itches blains,30
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,30
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,30
Take thou that too with multiplying bans!,30
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.,30
The Athenians both within and out that wall!,30
To the whole race of mankind high and low! Amen.,30
SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.,30
Hear you master steward where's our master?,30
Alack my fellows what should I say to you?,30
I am as poor as you.,30
So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not,30
And go along with him!,30
From our companion thrown into his grave,30
Slink all away leave their false vows with him,30
A dedicated beggar to the air,30
Walks like contempt alone. More of our fellows.,30
All broken implements of a ruin'd house.,30
That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,30
And we poor mates stand on the dying deck,30
Into this sea of air.,30
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.,30
Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads and say,30
We have seen better days.' Let each take some;,30
Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor.,30
O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!,30
Since riches point to misery and contempt?,30
But in a dream of friendship?,30
But only painted like his varnish'd friends?,30
Undone by goodness! Strange unusual blood,30
Who then dares to be half so kind again?,30
My dearest lord bless'd to be most accursed,30
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas kind lord!,30
Of monstrous friends nor has he with him to,30
I'll follow and inquire him out:,30
Whilst I have gold I'll be his steward still.,30
SCENE III. Woods and cave near the seashore.,30
O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth,30
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,30
Scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes;,30
To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune,30
Raise me this beggar and deny 't that lord;,30
The beggar native honour.,30
The want that makes him lean. Who dares who dares,30
And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,30
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate,30
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,30
All feasts societies and throngs of men!,30
Destruction fang mankind! Earth yield me roots!,30
Who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate,30
Gold? yellow glittering precious gold? No gods,30
Thus much of this will make black white foul fair,30
Ha you gods! why this? what this you gods? Why this,30
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:,30
Will knit and break religions bless the accursed,30
And give them title knee and approbation,30
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;,30
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices,30
Thou common whore of mankind that put'st odds,30
Do thy right nature.,30
Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,30
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.,30
Keeping some gold,30
What art thou there? speak.,30
For showing me again the eyes of man!,30
That art thyself a man?,30
For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog,30
I know thee well;,30
I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,30
With man's blood paint the ground gules gules:,30
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine,30
For all her cherubim look.,30
I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns,30
How came the noble Timon to this change?,30
But then renew I could not like the moon;,30
Noble Timon,30
None but to,30
What is it Timon?,30
wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art,30
thou art a man!,30
Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity.,30
As thine is now held with a brace of harlots.,30
Voiced so regardfully?,30
Yes.,30
Give them diseases leaving with thee their lust.,30
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth,30
Hang thee monster!,30
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.,30
The want whereof doth daily make revolt,30
How cursed Athens mindless of thy worth,30
But for thy sword and fortune trod upon them--,30
I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon.,30
I had rather be alone.,30
Here is some gold for thee.,30
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap--,30
Ay Timon and have cause.,30
And thee after when thou hast conquer'd!,30
That by killing of villains,30
Put up thy gold: go on--here's gold--go on;,30
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison,30
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;,30
It is her habit only that is honest,30
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,30
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,30
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;,30
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,30
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;,30
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,30
Make large confusion; and thy fury spent,30
Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou,30
Not all thy counsel.,30
upon thee!,30
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,30
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,30
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues,30
I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;,30
Be strong in whore allure him burn him up;,30
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains six months,30
With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,30
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,30
Well more gold: what then?,30
Consumptions sow,30
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,30
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,30
And not believes himself: down with the nose,30
Of him that his particular to foresee,30
ruffians bald;,30
Derive some pain from you: plague all;,30
The source of all erection. There's more gold:,30
And ditches grave you all!,30
More whore more mischief first; I have given you earnest.,30
If I thrive well I'll visit thee again.,30
I never did thee harm.,30
Call'st thou that harm?,30
Thy beagles with thee.,30
Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA,30
Should yet be hungry! Common mother thou,30
Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast,30
Whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd,30
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,30
Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;,30
From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root!,30
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!,30
Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face,30
Never presented!--O a root--dear thanks!--,30
Whereof ungrateful man with liquorish draughts,30
That from it all consideration slips!,30
More man? plague plague!,30
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.,30
Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!,30
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung,30
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?,30
Hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot,30
By putting on the cunning of a carper.,30
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,30
Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,30
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome,30
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,30
Were I like thee I'ld throw away myself.,30
A madman so long now a fool. What think'st,30
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,30
And skip where thou point'st out? will the,30
Candied with ice caudle thy morning taste,30
Whose naked natures live in an the spite,30
To the conflicting elements exposed,30
O thou shalt find--,30
I love thee better now than e'er I did.,30
Why?,30
I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.,30
To vex thee.,30
Dost please thyself in't?,30
What! a knave too?,30
To castigate thy pride 'twere well: but thou,30
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery,30
The one is filling still never complete;,30
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,30
Thou shouldst desire to die being miserable.,30
Thou art a slave whom Fortune's tender arm,30
Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded,30
To such as may the passive drugs of it,30
In general riot; melted down thy youth,30
The icy precepts of respect but follow'd,30
Who had the world as my confectionary,30
At duty more than I could frame employment,30
Do on the oak hive with one winter's brush,30
For every storm that blows: I to bear this,30
Thy nature did commence in sufferance time,30
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?,30
Must be thy subject who in spite put stuff,30
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence be gone!,30
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.,30
Ay that I am not thee.,30
No prodigal.,30
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,30
That the whole life of Athens were in this!,30
Eating a root,30
Offering him a root,30
So I shall mend mine own by the lack of thine.,30
if not I would it were.,30
Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,30
Here is no use for gold.,30
For here it sleeps and does no hired harm.,30
Under that's above me.,30
Where my stomach finds meat; or rather where I eat,30
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!,30
To sauce thy dishes.,30
extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt,30
curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none but art,30
thee eat it.,30
Dost hate a medlar?,30
An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst,30
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?,30
ever know beloved?,30
I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a,30
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare,30
Women nearest; but men men are the things,30
Apemantus if it lay in thy power?,30
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of,30
Ay Timon.,30
attain to! If thou wert the lion the fox would,30
eat three: if thou wert the fox the lion would,30
the ass: if thou wert the ass thy dulness would,30
breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf thy,30
hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the,30
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert,30
wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the,30
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on,30
defence absence. What beast couldst thou be that,30
thou already that seest not thy loss in,30
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou,30
Athens is become a forest of beasts.,30
Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of,30
and give way: when I know not what else to do I'll,30
When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be,30
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.,30
A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.,30
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.,30
I'll beat thee but I should infect my hands.,30
Away thou issue of a mangy dog!,30
I swound to see thee.,30
Away,30
A stone by thee.,30
Beast!,30
Toad!,30
I am sick of this false world and will love nought,30
Then Timon presently prepare thy grave;,30
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,30
To the gold,30
Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler,30
Thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer,30
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,30
And makest them kiss! that speak'st with,30
To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!,30
Set them into confounding odds that beasts,30
Would 'twere so!,30
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.,30
Ay.,30
Live and love thy misery.,30
Exit APEMANTUS,30
Moe things like men! Eat Timon and abhor them.,30
Where should he have this gold? It is some poor,30
mere want of gold and the falling-from of his,30
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.,30
for't he will supply us easily; if he covetously,30
True; for he bears it not about him 'tis hid.,30
Where?,30
He; I know him.,30
Now thieves?,30
Both too; and women's sons.,30
Your greatest want is you want much of meat.,30
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;,30
The bounteous housewife nature on each bush,30
We cannot live on grass on berries water,30
Nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes;,30
That you are thieves profess'd that you work not,30
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,30
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,30
His antidotes are poison and he slays,30
Do villany do since you protest to do't,30
The sun's a thief and with his great attraction,30
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:,30
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,30
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:,30
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,30
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,30
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this,30
Has almost charmed me from my profession by,30
Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises,30
I'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade.,30
so miserable but a man may be true.,30
Enter FLAVIUS,30
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?,30
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!,30
Has desperate want made!,30
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!,30
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!,30
Those that would mischief me than those that do!,30
My honest grief unto him; and as my lord,30
Away! what art thou?,30
Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;,30
An honest poor servant of yours.,30
I never had honest man about me I; all,30
The gods are witness,30
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.,30
love thee,30
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give,30
Strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping!,30
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts,30
Had I a steward,30
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.,30
Was born of woman.,30
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim,30
No more I pray--and he's a steward.,30
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all save thee,30
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;,30
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:,30
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--,30
Is not thy kindness subtle covetous,30
Expecting in return twenty for one?,30
Doubt and suspect alas are placed too late:,30
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.,30
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,30
My most honour'd lord,30
Either in hope or present I'ld exchange,30
To requite me by making rich yourself.,30
Here take: the gods out of my misery,30
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;,30
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,30
What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,30
blasted woods,30
And so farewell and thrive.,30
And comfort you my master.,30
Stay not; fly whilst thou art blest and free:,30
Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave,30
SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.,30
As I took note of the place it cannot be far where,30
What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold,30
Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and,30
straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said,30
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.,30
again and flourish with the highest. Therefore,30
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in,30
what they travail for if it be a just true report,30
What have you now to present unto him?,30
promise him an excellent piece.,30
that's coming toward him.,30
time: it opens the eyes of expectation:,30
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the,30
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind,30
in his judgment that makes it.,30
[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a,30
I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for,30
against the softness of prosperity with a discovery,30
[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in,30
other men? Do so I have gold for thee.,30
Then do we sin against our own estate,30
True;,30
Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.,30
god's gold,30
Than where swine feed!,30
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:,30
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!,30
Coming forward,30
Our late noble master!,30
Sir,30
Hearing you were retired your friends fall'n off,30
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:,30
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence,30
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude,30
Let it go naked men may see't the better:,30
Make them best seen and known.,30
Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,30
Ay you are honest men.,30
Most honest men! Why how shall I requite you?,30
What we can do we'll do to do you service.,30
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.,30
Came not my friend nor I.,30
Best in all Athens: thou'rt indeed the best;,30
So so my lord.,30
Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth,30
But for all this my honest-natured friends,30
Marry 'tis not monstrous in you neither wish I,30
Beseech your honour,30
You'll take it ill.,30
Will you indeed?,30
There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,30
Do we my lord?,30
Know his gross patchery love him feed him,30
That he's a made-up villain.,30
Nor I.,30
Rid me these villains from your companies:,30
Confound them by some course and come to me,30
Name them my lord let's know them.,30
Each man apart all single and alone,30
If where thou art two villains shall not be,30
But where one villain is then him abandon.,30
To Painter,30
To Poet,30
Out rascal dogs!,30
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators,30
For he is set so only to himself,30
Is friendly with him.,30
It is our part and promise to the Athenians,30
At all times alike,30
That framed him thus: time with his fairer hand,30
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,30
Here is his cave.,30
Look out and speak to friends: the Athenians,30
Speak to them noble Timon.,30
Thou sun that comfort'st burn! Speak and,30
For each true word a blister! and each false,30
Consuming it with speaking!,30
Of none but such as you and you of Timon.,30
I thank them; and would send them back the plague,30
O forget,30
The senators with one consent of love,30
On special dignities which vacant lie,30
They confess,30
Which now the public body which doth seldom,30
A lack of Timon's aid hath sense withal,30
And send forth us to make their sorrow'd render,30
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;,30
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,30
Ever to read them thine.,30
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:,30
And I'll beweep these comforts worthy senators.,30
And of our Athens thine and ours to take,30
Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name,30
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,30
His country's peace.,30
Against the walls of Athens.,30
Well sir I will; therefore I will sir; thus:,30
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,30
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,30
Of contumelious beastly mad-brain'd war,30
In pity of our aged and our youth,30
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,30
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp,30
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you,30
As thieves to keepers.,30
Why I was writing of my epitaph;,30
Of health and living now begins to mend,30
Be Alcibiades your plague you his,30
We speak in vain.,30
One that rejoices in the common wreck,30
That's well spoke.,30
These words become your lips as they pass,30
And enter in our ears like great triumphers,30
Commend me to them,30
Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses,30
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain,30
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.,30
I have a tree which grows here in my close,30
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,30
From high to low throughout that whoso please,30
Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe,30
Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.,30
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion,30
Who once a day with his embossed froth,30
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.,30
What is amiss plague and infection mend!,30
Sun hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.,30
His discontents are unremoveably,30
Our hope in him is dead: let us return,30
In our dear peril.,30
Exeunt,30
Enter two Senators and a Messenger,30
As full as thy report?,30
Besides his expedition promises,30
We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.,30
Whom though in general part we were opposed,30
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding,30
With letters of entreaty which imported,30
In part for his sake moved.,30
Enter the Senators from TIMON,30
The enemies' drum is heard and fearful scouring,30
Ours is the fall I fear; our foes the snare.,30
SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave and a rude tomb seen.,30
By all description this should be the place.,30
Timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span:,30
Dead sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb,30
Our captain hath in every figure skill,30
Before proud Athens he's set down by this,30
Exit,30
Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers,30
Our terrible approach.,30
Enter Senators on the walls,30
With all licentious measure making your wills,30
As slept within the shadow of your power,30
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,30
Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong,30
And pursy insolence shall break his wind,30
Noble and young,30
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,30
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves,30
So did we woo,30
By humble message and by promised means:,30
The common stroke of war.,30
Were not erected by their hands from whom,30
That these great towers trophies and schools,30
For private faults in them.,30
Who were the motives that you first went out;,30
Hath broke their hearts. March noble lord,30
By decimation and a tithed death--,30
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,30
Let die the spotted.,30
For those that were it is not square to take,30
Are not inherited. Then dear countryman,30
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin,30
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,30
But kill not all together.,30
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile,30
Set but thy foot,30
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,30
Throw thy glove,30
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress,30
Shall make their harbour in our town till we,30
Then there's my glove;,30
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own,30
Fall and no more: and to atone your fears,30
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream,30
But shall be render'd to your public laws,30
Tis most nobly spoken.,30
The Senators descend and open the gates,30
My noble general Timon is dead;,30
And on his grave-stone this insculpture which,30
Interprets for my poor ignorance.,30
wretched corse of wretched soul bereft:,30
caitiffs left!,30
Pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay,30
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:,30
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our,30
From niggard nature fall yet rich conceit,30
On thy low grave on faults forgiven. Dead,30
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,30
Make war breed peace make peace stint war make each,30
Let our drums strike.,30
ACT I,31
The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes  and Senators aloft. Enter below from one side  SATURNINUS and his Followers; and from the other side BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours,31
Defend the justice of my cause with arms,31
Plead my successive title with your swords:,31
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;,31
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.,31
If ever Bassianus Caesar's son,31
Keep then this passage to the Capitol,31
The imperial seat to virtue consecrate,31
But let desert in pure election shine,31
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft with the crown,31
Ambitiously for rule and empery,31
A special party have by common voice,31
Chosen Andronicus surnamed Pius,31
A nobler man a braver warrior,31
He by the senate is accit'd home,31
That with his sons a terror to our foes,31
Ten years are spent since first he undertook,31
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd,31
In coffins from the field;,31
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,31
Let us entreat by honour of his name,31
And in the Capitol and senate's right,31
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;,31
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.,31
Marcus Andronicus so I do ally,31
And so I love and honour thee and thine,31
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,31
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,31
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.,31
Friends that have been thus forward in my right,31
And to the love and favor of my country,31
Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS,31
As I am confident and kind to thee.,31
Tribunes and me a poor competitor.,31
Enter a Captain,31
Patron of virtue Rome's best champion,31
With honour and with fortune is return'd,31
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.,31
Hail Rome victorious in thy mourning weeds!,31
Returns with precious jading to the bay,31
Cometh Andronicus bound with laurel boughs,31
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.,31
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!,31
Half of the number that King Priam had,31
These that survive let Rome reward with love;,31
With burial amongst their ancestors:,31
Titus unkind and careless of thine own,31
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?,31
The tomb is opened,31
And sleep in peace slain in your country's wars!,31
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,31
That thou wilt never render to me more!,31
That we may hew his limbs and on a pile,31
Before this earthy prison of their bones;,31
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.,31
The eldest son of this distressed queen.,31
Victorious Titus rue the tears I shed,31
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,31
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,31
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,31
For valiant doings in their country's cause?,31
Were piety in thine it is in these.,31
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?,31
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:,31
Patient yourself madam and pardon me.,31
Alive and dead and for their brethren slain,31
To this your son is mark'd and die he must,31
Away with him! and make a fire straight;,31
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.,31
O cruel irreligious piety!,31
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.,31
To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.,31
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy,31
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,31
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--,31
Re-enter LUCIUS QUINTUS MARTIUS and MUTIUS with their swords bloody,31
Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,31
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.,31
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.,31
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.,31
In peace and honour rest you here my sons;,31
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!,31
Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,31
In peace and honour rest you here my sons!,31
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;,31
Lo at this tomb my tributary tears,31
And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy,31
O bless me here with thy victorious hand,31
Kind Rome that hast thus lovingly reserved,31
Lavinia live; outlive thy father's days,31
Enter below MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes; re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS attended,31
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!,31
And welcome nephews from successful wars,31
Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all,31
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,31
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.,31
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,31
This palliament of white and spotless hue;,31
With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:,31
And help to set a head on headless Rome.,31
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:,31
Be chosen with proclamations to-day,31
And set abroad new business for you all?,31
And led my country's strength successfully,31
Knighted in field slain manfully in arms,31
Give me a staff of honour for mine age,31
Upright he held it lords that held it last.,31
Proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell?,31
Romans do me right:,31
Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.,31
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!,31
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!,31
The people's hearts and wean them from themselves.,31
But honour thee and will do till I die:,31
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men,31
People of Rome and people's tribunes here,31
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?,31
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,31
Tribunes I thank you: and this suit I make,31
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will I hope,31
And ripen justice in this commonweal:,31
Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!',31
Patricians and plebeians we create,31
And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!',31
Titus Andronicus for thy favors done,31
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,31
And for an onset Titus to advance,31
Lavinia will I make my empress,31
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:,31
It doth my worthy lord; and in this match,31
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,31
The wide world's emperor do I consecrate,31
Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:,31
Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.,31
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts,31
The least of these unspeakable deserts,31
[To TAMORA]  Now madam are you prisoner to,31
To him that for your honour and your state,31
A goodly lady trust me; of the hue,31
Clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance:,31
Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:,31
Rest on my word and let not discontent,31
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.,31
Not I my lord; sith true nobility,31
Thanks sweet Lavinia. Romans let us go;,31
Proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum.,31
Lord Titus by your leave this maid is mine.,31
How sir! are you in earnest then my lord?,31
To do myself this reason and this right.,31
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.,31
Traitors avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?,31
Surprised! by whom?,31
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.,31
Brothers help to convey her hence away,31
Exeunt LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS,31
My lord you pass not here.,31
Barr'st me my way in Rome?,31
Help Lucius help!,31
During the fray SATURNINUS TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter above,31
My lord you are unjust and more than so,31
Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;,31
Traitor restore Lavinia to the emperor.,31
That is another's lawful promised love.,31
No Titus no; the emperor needs her not,31
I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;,31
Confederates all thus to dishonour me.,31
But Saturnine? Full well Andronicus,31
That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.,31
But go thy ways; go give that changing piece,31
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;,31
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.,31
And therefore lovely Tamora queen of Goths,31
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,31
Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride,31
Speak Queen of Goths dost thou applaud my choice?,31
Sith priest and holy water are so near,31
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,31
Or climb my palace till from forth this place,31
And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,31
She will a handmaid be to his desires,31
Ascend fair queen Pantheon. Lords accompany,31
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,31
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.,31
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.,31
Dishonour'd thus and challenged of wrongs?,31
O Titus see O see what thou hast done!,31
No foolish tribune no; no son of mine,31
That hath dishonour'd all our family;,31
But let us give him burial as becomes;,31
Traitors away! he rests not in this tomb:,31
Which I have sumptuously re-edified:,31
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:,31
My lord this is impiety in you:,31
He must be buried with his brethren.,31
And shall!' what villain was it that spake,31
He that would vouch it in any place but here.,31
No noble Titus but entreat of thee,31
Marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest,31
My foes I do repute you every one;,31
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.,31
MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel,31
Father and in that name doth nature speak--,31
Renowned Titus more than half my soul--,31
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter,31
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.,31
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,31
Did graciously plead for his funerals:,31
Be barr'd his entrance here.,31
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,31
Well bury him and bury me the next.,31
There lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends,31
[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;,31
My lord to step out of these dreary dumps,31
Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?,31
Whether by device or no the heavens can tell:,31
That brought her for this high good turn so far?,31
Flourish. Re-enter from one side SATURNINUS  attended TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and AARON; from the other BASSIANUS LAVINIA and others,31
God give you joy sir of your gallant bride!,31
Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.,31
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.,31
My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?,31
Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.,31
But if we live we'll be as sharp with you.,31
Answer I must and shall do with my life.,31
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,31
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;,31
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,31
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:,31
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds,31
Prince Bassianus leave to plead my deeds:,31
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,31
My worthy lord if ever Tamora,31
Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;,31
What madam! be dishonour'd openly,31
Not so my lord; the gods of Rome forfend,31
But on mine honour dare I undertake,31
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:,31
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,31
Aside to SATURNINUS,31
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:,31
Lest then the people and patricians too,31
And so supplant you for ingratitude,31
Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:,31
And raze their faction and their family,31
To whom I sued for my dear son's life,31
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.,31
Come come sweet emperor; come Andronicus;,31
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.,31
I thank your majesty and her my lord:,31
Titus I am incorporate in Rome,31
And must advise the emperor for his good.,31
And let it be mine honour good my lord,31
For you Prince Bassianus I have pass'd,31
That you will be more mild and tractable.,31
By my advice all humbled on your knees,31
We do and vow to heaven and to his highness,31
Tendering our sister's honour and our own.,31
Away and talk not; trouble us no more.,31
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;,31
Marcus for thy sake and thy brother's here,31
I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.,31
I found a friend and sure as death I swore,31
Come if the emperor's court can feast two brides,31
This day shall be a love-day Tamora.,31
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,31
Be it so Titus and gramercy too.,31
ACT II,31
Enter AARON,31
Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,31
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.,31
And having gilt the ocean with his beams,31
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;,31
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,31
Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts,31
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long,31
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes,31
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!,31
To wait upon this new-made empress.,31
This goddess this Semiramis this nymph,31
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.,31
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON braving,31
And manners to intrude where I am graced;,31
Demetrius thou dost over-ween in all;,31
Tis not the difference of a year or two,31
I am as able and as fit as thou,31
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,31
[Aside]  Clubs clubs! these lovers will not keep,31
Why boy although our mother unadvised,31
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?,31
Till you know better how to handle it.,31
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.,31
They draw,31
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,31
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:,31
The cause were known to them it most concerns;,31
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.,31
Not I till I have sheathed,31
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat,31
For that I am prepared and full resolved.,31
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!,31
Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore,31
Why lords and think you not how dangerous,31
What is Lavinia then become so loose,31
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd,31
Young lords beware! and should the empress know,31
I care not I knew she and all the world:,31
Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice:,31
Why are ye mad? or know ye not in Rome,31
And cannot brook competitors in love?,31
By this device.,31
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.,31
Why makest thou it so strange?,31
She is a woman therefore may be won;,31
What man! more water glideth by the mill,31
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know:,31
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.,31
Then why should he despair that knows to court it,31
What hast not thou full often struck a doe,31
Why then it seems some certain snatch or so,31
Ay so the turn were served.,31
Would you had hit it too!,31
Why hark ye hark ye! and are you such fools,31
That both should speed?,31
Nor me so I were one.,31
Tis policy and stratagem must do,31
That what you cannot as you would achieve,31
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste,31
A speedier course than lingering languishment,31
My lords a solemn hunting is in hand;,31
The forest walks are wide and spacious;,31
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:,31
And strike her home by force if not by words:,31
Come come our empress with her sacred wit,31
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;,31
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,31
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,31
The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull;,31
your turns;,31
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.,31
Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream,31
Per Styga per manes vehor.,31
SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.,31
The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey,31
Uncouple here and let us make a bay,31
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,31
Sons let it be your charge as it is ours,31
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,31
A cry of hounds and horns winded in a peal. Enter  SATURNINUS TAMORA BASSIANUS LAVINIA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and Attendants,31
Madam to you as many and as good:,31
And you have rung it lustily my lord;,31
Lavinia how say you?,31
I have been broad awake two hours and more.,31
And to our sport.,31
Madam now shall ye see,31
I have dogs my lord,31
And climb the highest promontory top.,31
Makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain.,31
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.,31
SCENE III. A lonely part of the forest.,31
He that had wit would think that I had none,31
And never after to inherit it.,31
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,31
A very excellent piece of villany:,31
Hides the gold,31
Enter TAMORA,31
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?,31
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,31
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:,31
And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,31
As if a double hunt were heard at once,31
And after conflict such as was supposed,31
When with a happy storm they were surprised,31
We may each wreathed in the other's arms,31
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds,31
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.,31
Saturn is dominator over mine:,31
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,31
Even as an adder when she doth unroll,31
No madam these are no venereal signs:,31
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.,31
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,31
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,31
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.,31
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.,31
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,31
Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life!,31
Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons,31
Exit,31
Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,31
Or is it Dian habited like her,31
To see the general hunting in this forest?,31
Had I the power that some say Dian had,31
With horns as was Actaeon's; and the hounds,31
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!,31
Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;,31
Are singled forth to try experiments:,31
Tis pity they should take him for a stag.,31
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,31
Why are you sequester'd from all your train,31
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,31
If foul desire had not conducted you?,31
Great reason that my noble lord be rated,31
And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;,31
The king my brother shall have note of this.,31
Good king to be so mightily abused!,31
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON,31
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?,31
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:,31
The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean,31
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,31
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,31
A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes,31
Would make such fearful and confused cries,31
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.,31
But straight they told me they would bind me here,31
And leave me to this miserable death:,31
Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms,31
And had you not by wondrous fortune come,31
Revenge it as you love your mother's life,31
This is a witness that I am thy son.,31
And this for me struck home to show my strength.,31
Ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora,31
Give me thy poniard; you shall know my boys,31
Stay madam; here is more belongs to her;,31
This minion stood upon her chastity,31
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:,31
An if she do I would I were an eunuch.,31
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.,31
Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting.,31
Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy,31
O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face--,31
Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word.,31
To see her tears; but be your heart to them,31
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?,31
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;,31
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:,31
Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.,31
Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:,31
The lion moved with pity did endure,31
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,31
O be to me though thy hard heart say no,31
I know not what it means; away with her!,31
That gave thee life when well he might have,31
Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears.,31
Even for his sake am I pitiless.,31
To save your brother from the sacrifice;,31
Therefore away with her and use her as you will,31
O Tamora be call'd a gentle queen,31
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;,31
What begg'st thou then? fond woman let me go.,31
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:,31
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,31
Do this and be a charitable murderer.,31
No let them satisfy their lust on thee.,31
No grace? no womanhood? Ah beastly creature!,31
Confusion fall--,31
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.,31
Farewell my sons: see that you make her sure.,31
Till all the Andronici be made away.,31
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.,31
Re-enter AARON with QUINTUS and MARTIUS,31
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit,31
My sight is very dull whate'er it bodes.,31
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.,31
What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,31
Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood,31
A very fatal place it seems to me.,31
O brother with the dismall'st object hurt,31
[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,31
How these were they that made away his brother.,31
Why dost not comfort me and help me out,31
I am surprised with an uncouth fear;,31
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.,31
Aaron and thou look down into this den,31
Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart,31
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;,31
Was I a child to fear I know not what.,31
All on a heap like to a slaughter'd lamb,31
If it be dark how dost thou know 'tis he?,31
A precious ring that lightens all the hole,31
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,31
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus,31
O brother help me with thy fainting hand--,31
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,31
Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out;,31
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb,31
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.,31
Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,31
Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.,31
Enter SATURNINUS with AARON,31
And what he is that now is leap'd into it.,31
Into this gaping hollow of the earth?,31
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,31
My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:,31
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;,31
We know not where you left him all alive;,31
Re-enter TAMORA with Attendants; TITUS ANDRONICUS and Lucius,31
Here Tamora though grieved with killing grief.,31
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:,31
Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,31
And wonder greatly that man's face can fold,31
She giveth SATURNINUS a letter,31
Sweet huntsman Bassianus 'tis we mean--,31
Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward,31
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit,31
Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends.',31
This is the pit and this the elder-tree.,31
That should have murdered Bassianus here.,31
[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps fell curs of,31
Have here bereft my brother of his life.,31
There let them bide until we have devised,31
What are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!,31
High emperor upon my feeble knee,31
That this fell fault of my accursed sons,31
If it be proved! you see it is apparent.,31
Andronicus himself did take it up.,31
For by my father's reverend tomb I vow,31
To answer their suspicion with their lives.,31
Some bring the murder'd body some the murderers:,31
For by my soul were there worse end than death,31
Andronicus I will entreat the king;,31
Come Lucius come; stay not to talk with them.,31
SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.,31
So now go tell an if thy tongue can speak,31
Write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so,31
See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.,31
She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash;,31
An 'twere my case I should go hang myself.,31
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON,31
Who is this? my niece that flies away so fast!,31
If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me!,31
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!,31
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare,31
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,31
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?,31
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,31
Coming and going with thy honey breath.,31
And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue.,31
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,31
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face,31
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?,31
That I might rail at him to ease my mind!,31
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.,31
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:,31
A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met,31
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.,31
Tremble like aspen-leaves upon a lute,31
He would not then have touch'd them for his life!,31
Which that sweet tongue hath made,31
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.,31
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:,31
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?,31
O could our mourning ease thy misery!,31
ACT III,31
Enter Judges Senators and Tribunes with MARTIUS  and QUINTUS bound passing on to the place of execution; TITUS going before pleading,31
For pity of mine age whose youth was spent,31
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;,31
And for these bitter tears which now you see,31
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,31
For two and twenty sons I never wept,31
Lieth down; the Judges  and c. pass by him and Exeunt,31
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:,31
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.,31
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,31
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;,31
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,31
Enter LUCIUS with his sword drawn,31
Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death;,31
My tears are now prevailing orators.,31
The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;,31
Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead.,31
My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak.,31
They would not mark me or if they did mark,31
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;,31
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,31
When I do weep they humbly at my feet,31
And were they but attired in grave weeds,31
A stone is soft as wax--tribunes more hard than stones;,31
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.,31
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?,31
For which attempt the judges have pronounced,31
O happy man! they have befriended thee.,31
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?,31
But me and mine: how happy art thou then,31
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?,31
Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep;,31
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.,31
This was thy daughter.,31
Ay me this object kills me!,31
Speak Lavinia what accursed hand,31
What fool hath added water to the sea,31
My grief was at the height before thou camest,31
Give me a sword I'll chop off my hands too;,31
And they have nursed this woe in feeding life;,31
And they have served me to effectless use:,31
Is that the one will help to cut the other.,31
For hands to do Rome service are but vain.,31
O that delightful engine of her thoughts,31
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,31
Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear!,31
O thus I found her straying in the park,31
That hath received some unrecuring wound.,31
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:,31
Environed with a wilderness of sea,31
Expecting ever when some envious surge,31
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;,31
And here my brother weeping at my woes.,31
Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul.,31
It would have madded me: what shall I do,31
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears:,31
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death,31
Look Marcus! ah son Lucius look on her!,31
Stood on her cheeks as doth the honey-dew,31
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;,31
If they did kill thy husband then be joyful,31
No no they would not do so foul a deed;,31
Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips.,31
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius,31
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,31
With miry slime left on them by a flood?,31
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,31
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?,31
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?,31
Plot some deuce of further misery,31
Sweet father cease your tears; for at your grief,31
Patience dear niece. Good Titus dry thine eyes.,31
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,31
Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks.,31
Had she a tongue to speak now would she say,31
His napkin with his true tears all bewet,31
O what a sympathy of woe is this,31
Enter AARON,31
Sends thee this word--that if thou love thy sons,31
Or any one of you chop off your hand,31
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;,31
O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!,31
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?,31
Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off?,31
That hath thrown down so many enemies,31
My youth can better spare my blood than you;,31
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,31
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?,31
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve,31
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.,31
For fear they die before their pardon come.,31
By heaven it shall not go!,31
Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine.,31
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.,31
Now let me show a brother's love to thee.,31
Then I'll go fetch an axe.,31
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS,31
Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine.,31
And never whilst I live deceive men so:,31
And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.,31
Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS,31
Good Aaron give his majesty my hand:,31
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it,31
As for my sons say I account of them,31
And yet dear too because I bought mine own.,31
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.,31
Their heads I mean. O how this villany,31
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace.,31
Exit,31
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:,31
To that I call!,31
What wilt thou kneel with me?,31
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,31
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.,31
And do not break into these deep extremes.,31
Then be my passions bottomless with them.,31
If there were reason for these miseries,31
When heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow?,31
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?,31
I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow!,31
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;,31
Become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd;,31
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.,31
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.,31
Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid,31
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;,31
Thy griefs their sports thy resolution mock'd;,31
More than remembrance of my father's death.,31
Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,31
These miseries are more than may be borne.,31
But sorrow flouted at is double death.,31
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!,31
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!,31
Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless,31
When will this fearful slumber have an end?,31
Thou dost not slumber: see thy two sons' heads,31
Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight,31
Even like a stony image cold and numb.,31
Rend off thy silver hair thy other hand,31
The closing up of our most wretched eyes;,31
Ha ha ha!,31
Why I have not another tear to shed:,31
And would usurp upon my watery eyes,31
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?,31
And threat me I shall never come to bliss,31
Even in their throats that have committed them.,31
You heavy people circle me about,31
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.,31
And in this hand the other I will bear.,31
Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth.,31
Thou art an exile and thou must not stay:,31
And if you love me as I think you do,31
Exeunt TITUS MARCUS and LAVINIA,31
The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:,31
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:,31
O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!,31
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.,31
And make proud Saturnine and his empress,31
Now will I to the Goths and raise a power,31
Exit,31
Enter TITUS MARCUS LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS a boy,31
Than will preserve just so much strength in us,31
Marcus unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:,31
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief,31
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;,31
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,31
To LAVINIA,31
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,31
Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans;,31
And just against thy heart make thou a hole;,31
May run into that sink and soaking in,31
Fie brother fie! teach her not thus to lay,31
How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?,31
What violent hands can she lay on her life?,31
To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,31
O handle not the theme to talk of hands,31
Fie fie how franticly I square my talk,31
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!,31
Here is no drink! Hark Marcus what she says;,31
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,31
Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought;,31
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:,31
Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign,31
And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.,31
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.,31
Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.,31
And tears will quickly melt thy life away.,31
What dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knife?,31
Out on thee murderer! thou kill'st my heart;,31
A deed of death done on the innocent,31
I see thou art not for my company.,31
But how if that fly had a father and mother?,31
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!,31
That with his pretty buzzing melody,31
kill'd him.,31
Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.,31
Then pardon me for reprehending thee,31
Give me thy knife I will insult on him;,31
Come hither purposely to poison me.--,31
Ah sirrah!,31
But that between us we can kill a fly,31
Alas poor man! grief has so wrought on him,31
Come take away. Lavinia go with me:,31
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.,31
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.,31
ACT IV,31
Enter young LUCIUS and LAVINIA running after him  and the boy flies from her with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS,31
Follows me every where I know not why:,31
Alas sweet aunt I know not what you mean.,31
She loves thee boy too well to do thee harm.,31
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?,31
See Lucius see how much she makes of thee:,31
Ah boy Cornelia never with more care,31
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.,31
My lord I know not I nor can I guess,31
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,31
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy,31
Although my lord I know my noble aunt,31
And would not but in fury fright my youth:,31
Causeless perhaps. But pardon me sweet aunt:,31
I will most willingly attend your ladyship.,31
LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall,31
Some book there is that she desires to see.,31
But thou art deeper read and better skill'd,31
And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens,31
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?,31
Confederate in the fact: ay more there was;,31
Lucius what book is that she tosseth so?,31
My mother gave it me.,31
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.,31
Helping her,31
This is the tragic tale of Philomel,31
And rape I fear was root of thine annoy.,31
Lavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girl,31
Forced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods? See see!,31
O had we never never hunted there!--,31
By nature made for murders and for rapes.,31
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?,31
but friends,31
Or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst,31
Sit down sweet niece: brother sit down by me.,31
Inspire me that I may this treason find!,31
This sandy plot is plain; guide if thou canst,31
Without the help of any hand at all.,31
Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!,31
What God will have discover'd for revenge;,31
That we may know the traitors and the truth!,31
O do ye read my lord what she hath writ?,31
What what! the lustful sons of Tamora,31
Magni Dominator poli,31
O calm thee gentle lord; although I know,31
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,31
My lord kneel down with me; Lavinia kneel;,31
And swear with me as with the woful fere,31
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,31
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,31
Tis sure enough an you knew how.,31
The dam will wake; and if she wind you once,31
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,31
You are a young huntsman Marcus; let it alone;,31
And with a gad of steel will write these words,31
Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,31
I say my lord that if I were a man,31
For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.,31
For his ungrateful country done the like.,31
Come go with me into mine armoury;,31
Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons,31
Come come; thou'lt do thy message wilt thou not?,31
No boy not so; I'll teach thee another course.,31
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:,31
Exeunt TITUS LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS,31
And not relent or not compassion him?,31
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart,31
But yet so just that he will not revenge.,31
Exit,31
Enter from one side AARON DEMETRIUS and  CHIRON; from the other side Young LUCIUS and an  Attendant with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them,31
He hath some message to deliver us.,31
My lords with all the humbleness I may,31
Aside,31
Gramercy lovely Lucius: what's the news?,31
For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,31
The goodliest weapons of his armoury,31
The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;,31
Your lordships that whenever you have need,31
And so I leave you both:,31
like bloody villains.,31
What's here? A scroll; and written round about?,31
Reads,31
Non eget Mauri jaculis nec arcu.',31
I read it in the grammar long ago.,31
Aside,31
Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;,31
That wound beyond their feeling to the quick.,31
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:,31
And now young lords was't not a happy star,31
Captives to be advanced to this height?,31
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.,31
Basely insinuate and send us gifts.,31
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?,31
At such a bay by turn to serve our lust.,31
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.,31
Come let us go; and pray to all the gods,31
[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.,31
Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?,31
Soft! who comes here?,31
Good morr ow lords:,31
Well more or less or ne'er a whit at all,31
O gentle Aaron we are all undone!,31
Why what a caterwauling dost thou keep!,31
O that which I would hide from heaven's eye,31
She is deliver'd lords; she is deliver'd.,31
I mean she is brought a-bed.,31
A devil.,31
A joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue:,31
Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:,31
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.,31
Sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure.,31
That which thou canst not undo.,31
Villain I have done thy mother.,31
Woe to her chance and damn'd her loathed choice!,31
It shall not live.,31
Aaron it must; the mother wills it so.,31
Do execution on my flesh and blood.,31
Nurse give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.,31
Takes the Child from the Nurse and draws,31
Now by the burning tapers of the sky,31
He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point,31
I tell you younglings not Enceladus,31
Nor great Alcides nor the god of war,31
What what ye sanguine shallow-hearted boys!,31
Coal-black is better than another hue,31
For all the water in the ocean,31
Although she lave them hourly in the flood.,31
To keep mine own excuse it how she can.,31
My mistress is my mistress; this myself,31
This before all the world do I prefer;,31
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.,31
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.,31
I blush to think upon this ignomy.,31
Fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing,31
Here's a young lad framed of another leer:,31
As who should say 'Old lad I am thine own.',31
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,31
He is enfranchised and come to light:,31
Although my seal be stamped in his face.,31
Advise thee Aaron what is to be done,31
Save thou the child so we may all be safe.,31
My son and I will have the wind of you:,31
They sit,31
Why so brave lords! when we join in league,31
The chafed boar the mountain lioness,31
But say again; how many saw the child?,31
And no one else but the deliver'd empress.,31
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:,31
He kills the nurse,31
What mean'st thou Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?,31
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,31
And now be it known to you my full intent.,31
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;,31
Go pack with him and give the mother gold,31
And how by this their child shall be advanced,31
And substituted in the place of mine,31
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.,31
Pointing to the nurse,31
The fields are near and you are gallant grooms:,31
But send the midwife presently to me.,31
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.,31
With secrets.,31
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.,31
Now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies;,31
And secretly to greet the empress' friends.,31
For it is you that puts us to our shifts:,31
And feed on curds and whey and suck the goat,31
To be a warrior and command a camp.,31
SCENE III. The same. A public place.,31
Come Marcus; come kinsmen; this is the way.,31
Look ye draw home enough and 'tis there straight.,31
Be you remember'd Marcus she's gone she's fled.,31
Go sound the ocean and cast your nets;,31
Yet there's as little justice as at land:,31
Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,31
Then when you come to Pluto's region,31
Tell him it is for justice and for aid,31
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.,31
What time I threw the people's suffrages,31
Go get you gone; and pray be careful all,31
This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;,31
O Publius is not this a heavy case,31
Therefore my lord it highly us concerns,31
And feed his humour kindly as we may,31
Kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy.,31
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,31
Publius how now! how now my masters!,31
No my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,31
Marry for Justice she is so employ'd,31
So that perforce you must needs stay a time.,31
I'll dive into the burning lake below,31
Marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we,31
But metal Marcus steel to the very back,31
And sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,31
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.,31
He gives them the arrows,31
Ad Martem' that's for myself:,31
To Saturn Caius not to Saturnine;,31
To it boy! Marcus loose when I bid.,31
There's not a god left unsolicited.,31
We will afflict the emperor in his pride.,31
They shoot,31
Good boy in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.,31
Your letter is with Jupiter by this.,31
Publius Publius what hast thou done?,31
This was the sport my lord: when Publius shot,31
That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;,31
She laugh'd and told the Moor he should not choose,31
Why there it goes: God give his lordship joy!,31
News news from heaven! Marcus the post is come.,31
Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?,31
them down again for the man must not be hanged till,31
But what says Jupiter I ask thee?,31
in all my life.,31
Ay of my pigeons sir; nothing else.,31
From heaven! alas sir I never came there     God,31
young days. Why I am going with my pigeons to the,31
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.,31
your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to,31
Tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor,31
Nay truly sir I could never say grace in all my life.,31
But give your pigeons to the emperor:,31
Hold hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.,31
deliver a supplication?,31
Then here is a supplication for you. And when you,31
then kiss his foot then deliver up your pigeons and,31
you do it bravely.,31
Sirrah hast thou a knife? come let me see it.,31
For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.,31
Knock at my door and tell me what he says.,31
Come Marcus let us go. Publius follow me.,31
SCENE IV. The same. Before the palace.,31
Why lords what wrongs are these! was ever seen,31
Troubled confronted thus; and for the extent,31
My lords you know as know the mightful gods,31
Buz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd,31
Of old Andronicus. And what an if,31
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,31
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:,31
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;,31
What's this but libelling against the senate,31
A goodly humour is it not my lords?,31
But if I live his feigned ecstasies,31
But he and his shall know that justice lives,31
He'll so awake as she in fury shall,31
My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine,31
Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus' age,31
Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;,31
Than prosecute the meanest or the best,31
Aside,31
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:,31
Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,31
Enter Clown,31
Yea forsooth an your mistership be emperial.,31
Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:,31
SATURNINUS reads the letter,31
How much money must I have?,31
Hanged! by'r lady then I have brought up a neck to,31
Exit guarded,31
Shall I endure this monstrous villany?,31
May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,31
Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!,31
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:,31
Sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great,31
Enter AEMILIUS,31
Arm arm my lord;--Rome never had more cause.,31
high-resolved men bent to the spoil,31
Of Lucius son to old Andronicus;,31
As much as ever Coriolanus did.,31
These tidings nip me and I hang the head,31
Ay now begin our sorrows to approach:,31
Myself hath often over-heard them say,31
That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,31
Why should you fear? is not your city strong?,31
And will revolt from me to succor him.,31
Is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it?,31
And is not careful what they mean thereby,31
He can at pleasure stint their melody:,31
Then cheer thy spirit : for know thou emperor,31
With words more sweet and yet more dangerous,31
When as the one is wounded with the bait,31
But he will not entreat his son for us.,31
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear,31
Almost impregnable his old ears deaf,31
To AEmilius,31
Say that the emperor requests a parley,31
Even at his father's house the old Andronicus.,31
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,31
Your bidding shall I do effectually.,31
Now will I to that old Andronicus;,31
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.,31
And bury all thy fear in my devices.,31
Exeunt,31
SCENE I. Plains near Rome.,31
Approved warriors and my faithful friends,31
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor,31
Therefore great lords be as your titles witness,31
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,31
Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus,31
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds,31
Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,31
Led by their master to the flowered fields,31
And as he saith so say we all with him.,31
But who comes here led by a lusty Goth?,31
Renowned Lucius from our troops I stray'd,31
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye,31
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.,31
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:,31
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,31
Villain thou mightst have been an emperor:,31
They never do beget a coal-black calf.,31
the babe--,31
Who when he knows thou art the empress' babe,31
With this my weapon drawn I rush'd upon him,31
To use as you think needful of the man.,31
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;,31
And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.,31
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?,31
A halter soldiers! hang him on this tree.,31
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.,31
First hang the child that he may see it sprawl;,31
Get me a ladder.,31
Lucius save the child,31
If thou do this I'll show thee wondrous things,31
If thou wilt not befall what may befall,31
Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st,31
An if it please thee! why assure thee Lucius,31
For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres,31
Complots of mischief treason villanies,31
And this shall all be buried by my death,31
Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.,31
Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:,31
What if I do not? as indeed I do not;,31
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,31
Which I have seen thee careful to observe,31
An idiot holds his bauble for a god,31
To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow,31
That thou adorest and hast in reverence,31
Or else I will discover nought to thee.,31
First know thou I begot him on the empress.,31
Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity,31
Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;,31
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.,31
Why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and 'twas,31
O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!,31
That codding spirit had they from their mother,31
That bloody mind I think they learn'd of me,31
Well let my deeds be witness of my worth.,31
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:,31
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,31
And what not done that thou hast cause to rue,31
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,31
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:,31
When for his hand he had his two sons' heads;,31
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :,31
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,31
What canst thou say all this and never blush?,31
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?,31
Even now I curse the day--and yet I think,31
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,31
Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it,31
Set deadly enmity between two friends,31
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,31
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,31
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;,31
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,31
Tut I have done a thousand dreadful things,31
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed,31
Bring down the devil; for he must not die,31
If there be devils would I were a devil,31
So I might have your company in hell,31
Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more.,31
My lord there is a messenger from Rome,31
Let him come near.,31
Welcome AEmilius what's the news from Rome?,31
The Roman emperor greets you all by me;,31
He craves a parley at your father's house,31
And they shall be immediately deliver'd.,31
AEmilius let the emperor give his pledges,31
And we will come. March away.,31
SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS's house.,31
Thus in this strange and sad habiliment,31
And say I am Revenge sent from below,31
Knock at his study where they say he keeps,31
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,31
They knock,31
Who doth molest my contemplation?,31
That so my sad decrees may fly away,31
You are deceived: for what I mean to do,31
And what is written shall be executed.,31
No not a word; how can I grace my talk,31
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.,31
I am not mad; I know thee well enough:,31
Witness these trenches made by grief and care,31
Witness all sorrow that I know thee well,31
Is not thy coming for my other hand?,31
She is thy enemy and I thy friend:,31
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,31
Come down and welcome me to this world's light;,31
There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,31
Where bloody murder or detested rape,31
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,31
Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,31
I am; therefore come down and welcome me.,31
Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;,31
Stab them or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;,31
And whirl along with thee about the globe.,31
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,31
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,31
Trot like a servile footman all day long,31
Until his very downfall in the sea:,31
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.,31
Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?,31
Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.,31
And you the empress! but we worldly men,31
O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee;,31
I will embrace thee in it by and by.,31
This closing with him fits his lunacy,31
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,31
And being credulous in this mad thought,31
And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,31
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,31
See here he comes and I must ply my theme.,31
Long have I been forlorn and all for thee:,31
Rapine and Murder you are welcome too.,31
Well are you fitted had you but a Moor:,31
For well I wot the empress never wags,31
And would you represent our queen aright,31
But welcome as you are. What shall we do?,31
Show me a murderer I'll deal with him.,31
And I am sent to be revenged on him.,31
And I will be revenged on them all.,31
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.,31
Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap,31
Good Rapine stab him; he's a ravisher.,31
There is a queen attended by a Moor;,31
for up and down she doth resemble thee:,31
They have been violent to me and mine.,31
But would it please thee good Andronicus,31
Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,31
When he is here even at thy solemn feast,31
The emperor himself and all thy foes;,31
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.,31
Marcus my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.,31
Go gentle Marcus to thy nephew Lucius;,31
Bid him repair to me and bring with him,31
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:,31
Feast at my house and he shall feast with them.,31
As he regards his aged father's life.,31
Exit,31
And take my ministers along with me.,31
Or else I'll call my brother back again,31
[Aside to her sons]  What say you boys? will you,31
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor,31
Yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair,31
[Aside]  I know them all though they suppose me mad,31
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!,31
Farewell Andronicus: Revenge now goes,31
I know thou dost; and sweet Revenge farewell.,31
Tell us old man how shall we be employ'd?,31
Publius come hither Caius and Valentine!,31
What is your will?,31
The empress' sons I take them Chiron and Demetrius.,31
The one is Murder Rape is the other's name;,31
Caius and Valentine lay hands on them.,31
And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,31
Exit,31
Villains forbear! we are the empress' sons.,31
Stop close their mouths let them not speak a word.,31
Re-enter TITUS with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife and she a basin,31
Sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me;,31
O villains Chiron and Demetrius!,31
This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.,31
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,31
Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear,31
Inhuman traitors you constrain'd and forced.,31
Villains for shame you could not beg for grace.,31
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,31
The basin that receives your guilty blood.,31
And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad:,31
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,31
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,31
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.,31
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;,31
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:,31
He cuts their throats,31
Let me go grind their bones to powder small,31
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.,31
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove,31
So now bring them in for I'll play the cook,31
Exeunt bearing the dead bodies,31
Enter LUCIUS MARCUS and Goths with AARON prisoner,31
That I repair to Rome I am content.,31
Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor,31
Let him receive no sustenance fetter him,31
For testimony of her foul proceedings:,31
I fear the emperor means no good to us.,31
And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth,31
Away inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!,31
Exeunt Goths with AARON. Flourish within,31
Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA with AEMILIUS Tribunes Senators and others,31
What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?,31
These quarrels must be quietly debated.,31
Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,31
Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places.,31
Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table,31
Welcome my gracious lord; welcome dread queen;,31
And welcome all: although the cheer be poor,31
Why art thou thus attired Andronicus?,31
To entertain your highness and your empress.,31
An if your highness knew my heart you were.,31
Was it well done of rash Virginius,31
Because she was enforced stain'd and deflower'd?,31
Your reason mighty lord?,31
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.,31
A pattern precedent and lively warrant,31
Die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee;,31
And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!,31
Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.,31
And have a thousand times more cause than he,31
What was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.,31
highness feed?,31
Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:,31
And they 'twas they that did her all this wrong.,31
Why there they are both baked in that pie;,31
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.,31
Kills TAMORA,31
Kills TITUS,31
There's meed for meed death for a deadly deed!,31
You sad-faced men people and sons of Rome,31
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,31
This scatter'd corn  into one mutual sheaf,31
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,31
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,31
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,31
Cannot induce you to attend my words,31
Speak Rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor,31
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear,31
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,31
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in,31
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;,31
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,31
When it should move you to attend me most,31
Here is a captain let him tell the tale;,31
Then noble auditory be it known to you,31
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;,31
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;,31
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,31
Lastly myself unkindly banished,31
To beg relief among Rome's enemies:,31
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.,31
That have preserved her welfare in my blood;,31
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.,31
My scars can witness dumb although they are,31
But soft! methinks I do digress too much,31
For when no friends are by men praise themselves.,31
Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant,31
The issue of an irreligious Moor,31
The villain is alive in Titus' house,31
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge,31
Or more than any living man could bear.,31
Have we done aught amiss--show us wherein,31
The poor remainder of Andronici,31
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,31
Speak Romans speak; and if you say we shall,31
Come come thou reverend man of Rome,31
Lucius our emperor; for well I know,31
Lucius all hail Rome's royal emperor!,31
To Attendants,31
To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,31
Exeunt Attendants,31
Lucius all hail Rome's gracious governor!,31
To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!,31
For nature puts me to a heavy task:,31
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.,31
Kissing TITUS,31
The last true duties of thy noble son!,31
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:,31
Countless and infinite yet would I pay them!,31
To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:,31
Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow:,31
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;,31
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,31
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:,31
Do him that kindness and take leave of him.,31
Would I were dead so you did live again!,31
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.,31
You sad Andronici have done with woes:,31
That hath been breeder of these dire events.,31
There let him stand and rave and cry for food;,31
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:,31
O why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?,31
I should repent the evils I have done:,31
Would I perform if I might have my will;,31
I do repent it from my very soul.,31
And give him burial in his father's grave:,31
Be closed in our household's monument.,31
No funeral rite nor man m mourning weeds,31
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:,31
And being so shall have like want of pity.,31
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:,31
That like events may ne'er it ruinate.,31
ACT I,32
In Troy there lies the scene. From isles of Greece,32
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,32
Of cruel war: sixty and nine that wore,32
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made,32
The ravish'd Helen Menelaus' queen,32
To Tenedos they come;,32
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains,32
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,32
And Antenorides with massy staples,32
Sperr up the sons of Troy.,32
On one and other side Trojan and Greek,32
A prologue arm'd but not in confidence,32
In like conditions as our argument,32
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,32
To what may be digested in a play.,32
Now good or bad 'tis but the chance of war.,32
Enter TROILUS armed and PANDARUS,32
Why should I war without the walls of Troy,32
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,32
Will this gear ne'er be mended?,32
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;,32
Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance,32
And skilless as unpractised infancy.,32
I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will,32
Have I not tarried?,32
the bolting.,32
Ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening.,32
Ay to the leavening; but here's yet in the word,32
heating of the oven and the baking; nay you must,32
Patience herself what goddess e'er she be,32
At Priam's royal table do I sit;,32
So traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?,32
her look or any woman else.,32
As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain,32
I have as when the sun doth light a storm,32
But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness,32
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--,32
the women: but for my part she is my kinswoman; I,32
somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did. I,32
O Pandarus! I tell thee Pandarus--,32
Reply not in how many fathoms deep,32
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;',32
Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice,32
In whose comparison all whites are ink,32
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense,32
As true thou tell'st me when I say I love her;,32
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me,32
I speak no more than truth.,32
Faith I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:,32
not she has the mends in her own hands.,32
I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of,32
between but small thanks for my labour.,32
Because she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair,32
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care,32
Say I she is not fair?,32
stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so,32
I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.,32
Not I.,32
Pray you speak no more to me: I will leave all as I,32
Exit PANDARUS. An alarum,32
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,32
I cannot fight upon this argument;,32
But Pandarus--O gods how do you plague me!,32
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.,32
Tell me Apollo for thy Daphne's love,32
Her bed is India; there she lies a pearl:,32
Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,32
Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark.,32
How now Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?,32
For womanish it is to be from thence.,32
That Paris is returned home and hurt.,32
Troilus by Menelaus.,32
Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.,32
Hark what good sport is out of town to-day!,32
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?,32
Come go we then together.,32
SCENE II. The Same. A street.,32
Who were those went by?,32
And whither go they?,32
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,32
Is as a virtue fix'd to-day was moved:,32
And like as there were husbandry in war,32
And to the field goes he; where every flower,32
In Hector's wrath.,32
The noise goes this: there is among the Greeks,32
They call him Ajax.,32
They say he is a very man per se,32
So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs.,32
particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,32
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his,32
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he,32
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without,32
joints of every thing but everything so out of joint,32
or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight.,32
me smile make Hector angry?,32
struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath,32
Who comes here?,32
Enter PANDARUS,32
As may be in the world lady.,32
Good morrow uncle Pandarus.,32
Good morrow Alexander. How do you cousin? When,32
This morning uncle.,32
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not,32
Hector was gone but Helen was not up.,32
That were we talking of and of his anger.,32
So he says here.,32
about him to-day I can tell them that: and there's,32
heed of Troilus I can tell them that too.,32
Who Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.,32
What not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a,32
Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him.,32
Then you say as I say; for I am sure he is not Hector.,32
Tis just to each of them; he is himself.,32
So he is.,32
He is not Hector.,32
himself! Well the gods are above; time must friend,32
in her body. No Hector is not a better man than Troilus.,32
He is elder.,32
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another,32
have his wit this year.,32
Nor his qualities.,32
Nor his beauty.,32
You have no judgment niece: Helen,32
a brown favour--for so 'tis I must confess--,32
No but brown.,32
To say the truth true and not true.,32
Why Paris hath colour enough.,32
Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised,32
having colour enough and the other higher is too,32
lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for,32
I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.,32
Nay I am sure she does. She came to him th' other,32
has not past three or four hairs on his chin--,32
particulars therein to a total.,32
three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.,32
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came,32
Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?,32
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.,32
Does he not?,32
Why go to then: but to prove to you that Helen,32
Troilus will stand to the proof if you'll,32
Troilus! why he esteems her no more than I esteem,32
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle,32
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled,32
must needs confess--,32
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.,32
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed,32
With mill-stones.,32
But there was more temperate fire under the pot of,32
And Hector laughed.,32
Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.,32
too.,32
What was his answer?,32
chin and one of them is white.,32
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and,32
hair is my father and all the rest are his sons.',32
my husband? 'The forked one' quoth he 'pluck't,32
and Helen so blushed an Paris so chafed and all the,32
So let it now; for it has been while going by.,32
So I do.,32
a man born in April.,32
against May.,32
Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we,32
Ilium? good niece do sweet niece Cressida.,32
Here here here's an excellent place; here we may,32
names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.,32
AENEAS passes,32
the flowers of Troy I can tell you: but mark,32
ANTENOR passes,32
That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit I can tell you;,32
judgments in whosoever and a proper man of person.,32
he see me you shall see him nod at me.,32
You shall see.,32
HECTOR passes,32
fellow! Go thy way Hector! There's a brave man,32
a countenance! is't not a brave man?,32
Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you,32
you see? look you there: there's no jesting;,32
there be hacks!,32
Swords! any thing he cares not; an the devil come,32
heart good. Yonder comes Paris yonder comes Paris.,32
Look ye yonder niece; is't not a gallant man too,32
hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why this will do,32
Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.,32
Who's that?,32
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.,32
Helenus? no. Yes he'll fight indifferent well. I,32
people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.,32
TROILUS passes,32
there's a man niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the,32
Peace for shame peace!,32
him niece: look you how his sword is bloodied and,32
and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw,32
Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess,32
Paris is dirt to him; and I warrant Helen to,32
Here come more.,32
Asses fools dolts! chaff and bran chaff and bran!,32
eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look ne'er look: the eagles,32
rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and,32
There is among the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilus.,32
Well well.,32
you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not,32
learning gentleness virtue youth liberality,32
Ay a minced man: and then to be baked with no date,32
You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you,32
Upon my back to defend my belly; upon my wit to,32
honesty; my mask to defend my beauty; and you to,32
thousand watches.,32
Nay I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the,32
not have hit I can watch you for telling how I took,32
past watching.,32
Enter Troilus's Boy,32
Where?,32
Good boy tell him I come.,32
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well good niece.,32
I'll be with you niece by and by.,32
Ay a token from Troilus.,32
Exit PANDARUS,32
He offers in another's enterprise;,32
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;,32
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.,32
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:,32
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.,32
Achievement is command; ungain'd beseech:,32
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.,32
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.,32
Princes,32
The ample proposition that hope makes,32
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters,32
As knots by the conflux of meeting sap,32
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.,32
That we come short of our suppose so far,32
Sith every action that hath gone before,32
Bias and thwart not answering the aim,32
That gave't surmised shape. Why then you princes,32
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else,32
To find persistive constancy in men:,32
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,32
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:,32
Distinction with a broad and powerful fan,32
And what hath mass or matter by itself,32
With due observance of thy godlike seat,32
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance,32
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail,32
With those of nobler bulk!,32
The gentle Thetis and anon behold,32
Bounding between the two moist elements,32
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now,32
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so,32
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness,32
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind,32
And flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage,32
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key,32
Agamemnon,32
Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit.,32
Should be shut up hear what Ulysses speaks.,32
To AGAMEMNON,32
To NESTOR,32
I give to both your speeches which were such,32
Should hold up high in brass and such again,32
Should with a bond of air strong as the axle-tree,32
To his experienced tongue yet let it please both,32
Speak prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect,32
Divide thy lips than we are confident,32
We shall hear music wit and oracle.,32
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,32
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:,32
Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions.,32
To whom the foragers shall all repair,32
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.,32
Observe degree priority and place,32
Office and custom in all line of order;,32
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered,32
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,32
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets,32
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!,32
Commotion in the winds! frights changes horrors,32
The unity and married calm of states,32
Which is the ladder to all high designs,32
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,32
The primogenitive and due of birth,32
But by degree stand in authentic place?,32
And hark what discord follows! each thing meets,32
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,32
Strength should be lord of imbecility,32
Force should be right; or rather right and wrong,32
Should lose their names and so should justice too.,32
Power into will will into appetite;,32
So doubly seconded with will and power,32
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,32
Follows the choking.,32
That by a pace goes backward with a purpose,32
By him one step below he by the next,32
Exampled by the first pace that is sick,32
Of pale and bloodless emulation:,32
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,32
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd,32
The nature of the sickness found Ulysses,32
The great Achilles whom opinion crowns,32
Having his ear full of his airy fame,32
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus,32
Breaks scurril jests;,32
Which slanderer he imitation calls,32
Thy topless deputation he puts on,32
Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich,32
Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage--,32
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,32
Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd,32
The large Achilles on his press'd bed lolling,32
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.,32
As he being drest to some oration.',32
Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife:,32
Tis Nestor right. Now play him me Patroclus,32
And then forsooth the faint defects of age,32
And with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,32
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O enough Patroclus;,32
In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,32
Severals and generals of grace exact,32
Excitements to the field or speech for truce,32
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.,32
Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns,32
Ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head,32
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;,32
Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites,32
To match us in comparisons with dirt,32
How rank soever rounded in with danger.,32
Count wisdom as no member of the war,32
But that of hand: the still and mental parts,32
When fitness calls them on and know by measure,32
Why this hath not a finger's dignity:,32
So that the ram that batters down the wall,32
They place before his hand that made the engine,32
By reason guide his execution.,32
Makes many Thetis' sons.,32
What trumpet? look Menelaus.,32
Enter AENEAS,32
Is this great Agamemnon's tent I pray you?,32
May one that is a herald and a prince,32
With surety stronger than Achilles' arm,32
Call Agamemnon head and general.,32
A stranger to those most imperial looks,32
How!,32
I ask that I might waken reverence,32
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes,32
Which is that god in office guiding men?,32
This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy,32
Courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd,32
But when they would seem soldiers they have galls,32
Jove's accord,32
Peace Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!,32
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:,32
That breath fame blows; that praise sole sure,32
Sir you of Troy call you yourself AEneas?,32
What's your affair I pray you?,32
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.,32
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,32
And then to speak.,32
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:,32
He tells thee so himself.,32
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;,32
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.,32
We have great Agamemnon here in Troy,32
Who in this dull and long-continued truce,32
And to this purpose speak. Kings princes lords!,32
That holds his honour higher than his ease,32
That knows his valour and knows not his fear,32
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,32
In other arms than hers--to him this challenge.,32
Shall make it good or do his best to do it,32
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,32
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,32
If any come Hector shall honour him;,32
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth,32
This shall be told our lovers Lord AEneas;,32
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;,32
That means not hath not or is not in love!,32
That one meets Hector; if none else I am he.,32
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;,32
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,32
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,32
And meeting him will tell him that my lady,32
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,32
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!,32
Fair Lord AEneas let me touch your hand;,32
Achilles shall have word of this intent;,32
Yourself shall feast with us before you go,32
Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR,32
What says Ulysses?,32
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.,32
This 'tis:,32
That hath to this maturity blown up,32
Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil,32
Well and how?,32
However it is spread in general name,32
The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,32
And in the publication make no strain,32
As banks of Libya--though Apollo knows,32
Ay with celerity find Hector's purpose,32
And wake him to the answer think you?,32
That can from Hector bring his honour off,32
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;,32
With their finest palate: and trust to me Ulysses,32
In this wild action; for the success,32
Of good or bad unto the general;,32
To their subsequent volumes there is seen,32
Of things to come at large. It is supposed,32
And choice being mutual act of all our souls,32
As 'twere from us all a man distill'd,32
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,32
Which entertain'd limbs are his instruments,32
Directive by the limbs.,32
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.,32
And think perchance they'll sell; if not,32
Shall show the better. Do not consent,32
For both our honour and our shame in this,32
I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?,32
Were he not proud we all should share with him:,32
A nd we were better parch in Afric sun,32
Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,32
In taint of our best man. No make a lottery;,32
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves,32
For that will physic the great Myrmidon,32
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.,32
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,32
That we have better men. But hit or miss,32
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.,32
Now I begin to relish thy advice;,32
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.,32
Must tarre the mastiffs on as 'twere their bone.,32
ACT II,32
Enter AJAX and THERSITES,32
Agamemnon how if he had boils? full all over,32
Thersites!,32
general run then? were not that a botchy core?,32
Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.,32
Beating him,32
The plague of Greece upon thee thou mongrel,32
Speak then thou vinewedst leaven speak: I will,32
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,32
thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,32
Toadstool learn me the proclamation.,32
The proclamation!,32
Do not porpentine do not: my fingers itch.,32
the scratching of thee; I would make thee the,32
the incursions thou strikest as slow as another.,32
Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,32
Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty ay that thou,32
Mistress Thersites!,32
Cobloaf!,32
sailor breaks a biscuit.,32
Do do.,32
Ay do do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no,32
may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art,32
sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave.,32
tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no,32
You dog!,32
[Beating him]  You cur!,32
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS,32
Thersites! what's the matter man?,32
Ay; what's the matter?,32
So I do: what's the matter?,32
Well!' why I do so.,32
take him to be he is Ajax.,32
Ay but that fool knows not himself.,32
Lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters! his,32
brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy,32
worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,32
his guts in his head I'll tell you what I say of,32
What?,32
Ajax offers to beat him,32
Has not so much wit--,32
As will stop the eye of Helen's needle for whom he,32
Peace fool!,32
not: he there: that he: look you there.,32
Will you set your wit to a fool's?,32
Good words Thersites.,32
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the,32
I serve thee not.,32
I serve here voluntarily.,32
voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was,32
E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your,32
catch if he knock out either of your brains: a',32
What with me too Thersites?,32
ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you,32
What what?,32
I shall cut out your tongue.,32
afterwards.,32
I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me shall I?,32
I will see you hanged like clotpoles ere I come,32
wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.,32
A good riddance.,32
That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun,32
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms,32
Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.,32
I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise,32
O meaning you. I will go learn more of it.,32
SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.,32
After so many hours lives speeches spent,32
Deliver Helen and all damage else--,32
Wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed,32
Shall be struck off.' Hector what say you to't?,32
As far as toucheth my particular,32
There is no lady of more softer bowels,32
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?',32
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd,32
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:,32
Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes,32
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,32
Had it our name the value of one ten,32
The yielding of her up?,32
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king,32
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum,32
And buckle in a waist most fathomless,32
As fears and reasons? fie for godly shame!,32
You are so empty of them. Should not our father,32
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?,32
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are,32
You know an enemy intends you harm;,32
And reason flies the object of all harm:,32
A Grecian and his sword if he do set,32
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,32
Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour,32
their thoughts,32
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.,32
The holding.,32
But value dwells not in particular will;,32
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself,32
To make the service greater than the god,32
To what infectiously itself affects,32
I take to-day a wife and my election,32
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,32
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,32
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion,32
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,32
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,32
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:,32
The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce,32
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,32
Wrinkles Apollo's and makes stale the morning.,32
Is she worth keeping? why she is a pearl,32
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.,32
As you must needs for you all cried 'Go go'--,32
As you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands,32
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,32
Beggar the estimation which you prized,32
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!,32
That in their country did them that disgrace,32
[Within]  Cry Trojans cry!,32
Tis our mad sister I do know her voice.,32
It is Cassandra.,32
Cry Trojans cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,32
Peace sister peace!,32
Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry,32
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.,32
Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand;,32
Cry Trojans cry! a Helen and a woe:,32
Exit,32
Of divination in our sister work,32
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,32
Can qualify the same?,32
We may not think the justness of each act,32
Nor once deject the courage of our minds,32
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel,32
To make it gracious. For my private part,32
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us,32
To fight for and maintain!,32
As well my undertakings as your counsels:,32
Gave wings to my propension and cut off,32
For what alas can these my single arms?,32
To stand the push and enmity of those,32
Were I alone to pass the difficulties,32
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,32
Paris you speak,32
You have the honey still but these the gall;,32
Sir I propose not merely to myself,32
But I would have the soil of her fair rape,32
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,32
Now to deliver her possession up,32
That so degenerate a strain as this,32
There's not the meanest spirit on our party,32
When Helen is defended nor none so noble,32
Where Helen is the subject; then I say,32
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.,32
And on the cause and question now in hand,32
Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought,32
The reasons you allege do more conduce,32
Than to make up a free determination,32
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice,32
All dues be render'd to their owners: now,32
Than wife is to the husband? If this law,32
And that great minds of partial indulgence,32
There is a law in each well-order'd nation,32
Most disobedient and refractory.,32
As it is known she is these moral laws,32
To have her back return'd: thus to persist,32
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion,32
My spritely brethren I propend to you,32
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance,32
Why there you touch'd the life of our design:,32
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,32
Spent more in her defence. But worthy Hector,32
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,32
And fame in time to come canonize us;,32
So rich advantage of a promised glory,32
For the wide world's revenue.,32
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.,32
The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks,32
I was advertised their great general slept,32
This I presume will wake him.,32
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.,32
How now Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of,32
beats me and I rail at him: O worthy satisfaction!,32
whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot I'll learn to,32
my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles a,32
undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of,32
forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and,32
caduceus if ye take not that little little less,32
short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant,32
from a spider without drawing their massy irons and,32
whole camp! or rather the bone-ache! for that,32
for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy,32
Enter PATROCLUS,32
If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou,32
it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common,32
great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor and,32
direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee,32
sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.,32
What art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?,32
Enter ACHILLES,32
Thersites my lord.,32
digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to,32
Thy commander Achilles. Then tell me Patroclus,32
Thy lord Thersites: then tell me I pray thee,32
Thy knower Patroclus: then tell me Patroclus,32
Thou mayst tell that knowest.,32
I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands,32
knower and Patroclus is a fool.,32
Peace fool! I have not done.,32
Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites,32
Derive this; come.,32
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;,32
Patroclus is a fool positive.,32
Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou,32
Patroclus I'll speak with nobody.,32
Exit,32
knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a,32
and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on,32
Exit,32
Where is Achilles?,32
Let it be known to him that we are here.,32
Our appertainments visiting of him:,32
We dare not move the question of our place,32
I shall say so to him.,32
We saw him at the opening of his tent:,32
Yes lion-sick sick of proud heart: you may call it,32
head 'tis pride: but why why? let him show us the,32
Takes AGAMEMNON aside,32
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.,32
He.,32
No you see he is his argument that has his,32
All the better; their fraction is more our wish than,32
could disunite.,32
untie. Here comes Patroclus.,32
No Achilles with him.,32
his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure.,32
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure,32
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other,32
And after-dinner's breath.,32
We are too well acquainted with these answers:,32
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.,32
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,32
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,32
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,32
If you do say we think him over-proud,32
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier,32
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,32
And underwrite in an observing kind,32
His pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if,32
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this and add,32
We'll none of him; but let him like an engine,32
Bring action hither this cannot go to war:,32
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.,32
Exit,32
We come to speak with him. Ulysses enter you.,32
What is he more than another?,32
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a,32
No question.,32
No noble Ajax; you are as strong as valiant as,32
more tractable.,32
know not what pride is.,32
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is,32
and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours,32
I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering of toads.,32
Aside,32
Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.,32
He doth rely on none,32
Without observance or respect of any,32
Why will he not upon our fair request,32
Things small as nothing for request's sake only,32
And speaks not to himself but with a pride,32
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse,32
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages,32
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it,32
Let Ajax go to him.,32
Tis said he holds you well and will be led,32
O Agamemnon let it not be so!,32
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord,32
And never suffers matter of the world,32
And ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd,32
No this thrice worthy and right valiant lord,32
Nor by my will assubjugate his merit,32
By going to Achilles:,32
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns,32
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,32
[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O this is well; he rubs the,32
[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up,32
If I go to him with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.,32
An a' be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride:,32
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.,32
How he describes himself!,32
The raven chides blackness.,32
He will be the physician that should be the patient.,32
Wit would be out of fashion.,32
shall pride carry it?,32
A' would have ten shares.,32
He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:,32
[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord you feed too much on this dislike.,32
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.,32
Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;,32
Wherefore should you so?,32
Know the whole world he is as valiant.,32
Would he were a Trojan!,32
If he were proud--,32
Ay or surly borne--,32
Thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure;,32
Famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature,32
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,32
And give him half: and for thy vigour,32
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,32
Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;,32
He must he is he cannot but be wise:,32
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,32
But be as Ajax.,32
Ay my good son.,32
There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles,32
To call together all his state of war;,32
We must with all our main of power stand fast:,32
And cull their flower Ajax shall cope the best.,32
Light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep.,32
ACT III,32
Enter a Servant and PANDARUS,32
the young Lord Paris?,32
You depend upon him I mean?,32
You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs,32
The lord be praised!,32
Faith sir superficially.,32
I hope I shall know your honour better.,32
You are in the state of grace.,32
Music within,32
I do but partly know sir: it is music in parts.,32
Wholly sir.,32
To the hearers sir.,32
At mine sir and theirs that love music.,32
Who shall I command sir?,32
courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request,32
That's to 't indeed sir: marry sir at the request,32
the mortal Venus the heart-blood of beauty love's,32
Who my cousin Cressida?,32
attributes?,32
Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the,32
upon him for my business seethes.,32
Enter PARIS and HELEN attended,32
company! fair desires in all fair measure,32
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!,32
You speak your fair pleasure sweet queen. Fair,32
You have broke it cousin: and by my life you,32
with a piece of your performance. Nell he is full,32
Truly lady no.,32
Rude in sooth; in good sooth very rude.,32
I have business to my lord dear queen. My lord,32
Nay this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you,32
Well sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,32
friend your brother Troilus--,32
Go to sweet queen to go:--commends himself most,32
You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,32
Sweet queen sweet queen! that's a sweet queen i' faith.,32
Nay that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,32
no. And my lord he desires you that if the king,32
My Lord Pandarus--,32
What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?,32
What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out,32
I'll lay my life with my disposer Cressida.,32
disposer is sick.,32
Ay good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,32
I spy.,32
instrument. Now sweet queen.,32
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,32
She shall have it my lord if it be not my lord Paris.,32
Falling in after falling out may make them three.,32
you a song now.,32
hast a fine forehead.,32
Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.,32
Love! ay that it shall i' faith.,32
In good troth it begins so.,32
Love love nothing but love still more!,32
Shoots buck and doe:,32
Not that it wounds,32
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!,32
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!,32
Oh! oh! a while but ha! ha! ha!,32
Heigh-ho!,32
He eats nothing but doves love and that breeds hot,32
thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love.,32
thoughts and hot deeds? Why they are vipers:,32
a-field to-day?,32
gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,32
brother Troilus went not?,32
Not I honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they,32
To a hair.,32
Commend me to your niece.,32
Exit,32
They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,32
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,32
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel,32
Than all the island kings--disarm great Hector.,32
Yea what he shall receive of us in duty,32
Yea overshines ourself.,32
Exeunt,32
Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy meeting,32
Cressida's?,32
O here he comes.,32
How now how now!,32
Exit Boy,32
No Pandarus: I stalk about her door,32
Staying for waftage. O be thou my Charon,32
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds,32
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,32
Walk here i' the orchard I'll bring her straight.,32
I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.,32
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,32
Love's thrice repured nectar? death I fear me,32
Too subtle-potent tuned too sharp in sweetness,32
I fear it much; and I do fear besides,32
As doth a battle when they charge on heaps,32
Re-enter PANDARUS,32
must be witty now. She does so blush and fetches,32
sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest,32
new-ta'en sparrow.,32
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:,32
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,32
The eye of majesty.,32
Come come what need you blush? shame's a baby.,32
you have sworn to me. What are you gone again?,32
Come your ways come your ways; an you draw backward,32
her? Come draw this curtain and let's see your,32
daylight! an 'twere dark you'ld close sooner.,32
a kiss in fee-farm! build there carpenter; the air,32
I part you. The falcon as the tercel for all the,32
You have bereft me of all words lady.,32
bereave you o' the deeds too if she call your,32
In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--,32
Exit,32
O Cressida how often have I wished me thus!,32
What should they grant? what makes this pretty,32
lady in the fountain of our love?,32
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.,32
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to,32
O let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's,32
Nor nothing monstrous neither?,32
seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers; thinking,32
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.,32
is infinite and the execution confined that the,32
They say all lovers swear more performance than they,32
perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and,32
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,32
Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we,32
bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion,32
desert before his birth and being born his addition,32
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst,32
speak truest not truer than Troilus.,32
Re-enter PANDARUS,32
Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you.,32
you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he,32
You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my,32
Nay I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,32
constant being won: they are burs I can tell you;,32
Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.,32
For many weary months.,32
Hard to seem won: but I was won my lord,32
If I confess much you will play the tyrant.,32
But I might master it: in faith I lie;,32
Too headstrong for their mother. See we fools!,32
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?,32
And yet good faith I wish'd myself a man,32
Of speaking first. Sweet bid me hold my tongue,32
The thing I shall repent. See see your silence,32
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.,32
Pretty i' faith.,32
Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss:,32
For this time will I take my leave my lord.,32
Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning--,32
What offends you lady?,32
You cannot shun Yourself.,32
I have a kind of self resides with you;,32
To be another's fool. I would be gone:,32
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.,32
And fell so roundly to a large confession,32
Or else you love not for to be wise and love,32
O that I thought it could be in a woman--,32
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;,32
Outliving beauty's outward with a mind,32
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,32
Might be affronted with the match and weight,32
How were I then uplifted! but alas!,32
And simpler than the infancy of truth.,32
O virtuous fight,32
True swains in love shall in the world to come,32
Full of protest of oath and big compare,32
As true as steel as plantage to the moon,32
As iron to adamant as earth to the centre,32
As truth's authentic author to be cited,32
And sanctify the numbers.,32
If I be false or swerve a hair from truth,32
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,32
And mighty states characterless are grated,32
From false to false among false maids in love,32
As air as water wind or sandy earth,32
Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son',32
As false as Cressid.',32
witness. Here I hold your hand here my cousin's.,32
taken such pains to bring you together let all,32
after my name; call them all Pandars; let all,32
and all brokers-between Pandars! say amen.,32
Amen.,32
bed; which bed because it shall not speak of your,32
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,32
Exeunt,32
Enter AGAMEMNON ULYSSES DIOMEDES NESTOR AJAX MENELAUS and CALCHAS,32
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud,32
That through the sight I bear in things to love,32
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,32
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all,32
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,32
As new into the world strange unacquainted:,32
To give me now a little benefit,32
Which you say live to come in my behalf.,32
You have a Trojan prisoner call'd Antenor,32
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--,32
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,32
That their negotiations all must slack,32
Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam,32
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence,32
In most accepted pain.,32
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have,32
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:,32
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.,32
Which I am proud to bear.,32
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS before their tent,32
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,32
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:,32
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:,32
To use between your strangeness and his pride,32
It may be good: pride hath no other glass,32
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.,32
A form of strangeness as we pass along:,32
Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more,32
What comes the general to speak with me?,32
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?,32
No.,32
The better.,32
Good day good day.,32
Exit,32
How now Patroclus!,32
Ha?,32
Ay and good next day too.,32
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?,32
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;,32
To holy altars.,32
Tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune,32
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others,32
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,32
Hath any honour but honour for those honours,32
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:,32
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,32
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:,32
At ample point all that I did possess,32
Something not worth in me such rich beholding,32
I'll interrupt his reading.,32
Now great Thetis' son!,32
A strange fellow here,32
How much in having or without or in,32
Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection;,32
Heat them and they retort that heat again,32
This is not strange Ulysses.,32
The bearer knows not but commends itself,32
That most pure spirit of sense behold itself,32
Salutes each other with each other's form;,32
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there,32
I do not strain at the position--,32
Who in his circumstance expressly proves,32
Though in and of him there be much consisting,32
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,32
Where they're extended; who like an arch,32
The voice again or like a gate of steel,32
His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;,32
The unknown Ajax.,32
That has he knows not what. Nature what things there are,32
What things again most dear in the esteem,32
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--,32
While some men leave to do!,32
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!,32
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!,32
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,32
And great Troy shrieking.,32
As misers do by beggars neither gave to me,32
Time hath my lord a wallet at his back,32
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:,32
As fast as they are made forgot as soon,32
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang,32
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;,32
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;,32
That one by one pursue: if you give way,32
Like to an enter'd tide they all rush by,32
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,32
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,32
For time is like a fashionable host,32
And with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly,32
And farewell goes out sighing. O let not,32
Remuneration for the thing it was;,32
High birth vigour of bone desert in service,32
To envious and calumniating time.,32
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,32
And give to dust that is a little gilt,32
The present eye praises the present object.,32
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;,32
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,32
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive,32
Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late,32
And drave great Mars to faction.,32
I have strong reasons.,32
The reasons are more potent and heroical:,32
With one of Priam's daughters.,32
Is that a wonder?,32
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,32
Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods,32
There is a mystery--with whom relation,32
Which hath an operation more divine,32
All the commerce that you have had with Troy,32
And better would it fit Achilles much,32
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,32
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,32
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.',32
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.,32
To this effect Achilles have I moved you:,32
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man,32
They think my little stomach to the war,32
Sweet rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid,32
And like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,32
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?,32
I see my reputation is at stake,32
O then beware;,32
Omission to do what is necessary,32
And danger like an ague subtly taints,32
Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus:,32
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat,32
An appetite that I am sick withal,32
To talk with him and to behold his visage,32
Enter THERSITES,32
A wonder!,32
Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself.,32
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector and is so,32
raves in saying nothing.,32
Why he stalks up and down like a peacock--a stride,32
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:,32
say 'There were wit in this head an 'twould out;',32
in a flint which will not show without knocking.,32
neck i' the combat he'll break 't himself in,32
Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks Agamemnon.' What think,32
grown a very land-fish language-less a monster.,32
sides like a leather jerkin.,32
Who I? why he'll answer nobody; he professes not,32
tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let,32
pageant of Ajax.,32
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector,32
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous,32
captain-general of the Grecian army Agamemnon,32
Jove bless great Ajax!,32
I come from the worthy Achilles--,32
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent--,32
And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.,32
Ay my lord.,32
What say you to't?,32
Your answer sir.,32
go one way or other: howsoever he shall pay for me,32
Your answer sir.,32
Why but he is not in this tune is he?,32
him when Hector has knocked out his brains I know,32
get his sinews to make catlings on.,32
Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more,32
My mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd;,32
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS,32
that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a,32
Exit,32
SCENE I. Troy. A street.,32
See ho! who is that there?,32
Is the prince there in person?,32
As you prince Paris nothing but heavenly business,32
That's my mind too. Good morrow Lord AEneas.,32
Witness the process of your speech wherein,32
Did haunt you in the field.,32
During all question of the gentle truce;,32
As heart can think or courage execute.,32
Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health!,32
By Jove I'll play the hunter for thy life,32
And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly,32
Welcome to Troy! now by Anchises' life,32
No man alive can love in such a sort,32
We sympathize: Jove let AEneas live,32
A thousand complete courses of the sun!,32
With every joint a wound and that to-morrow!,32
We do; and long to know each other worse.,32
The noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of.,32
I was sent for to the king; but why I know not.,32
To Calchas' house and there to render him,32
Let's have your company or if you please,32
Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge--,32
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.,32
We shall be much unwelcome.,32
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece,32
There is no help;,32
Will have it so. On lord; we'll follow you.,32
Exit with Servant,32
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,32
Myself or Menelaus?,32
He merits well to have her that doth seek her,32
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,32
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,32
He like a puling cuckold would drink up,32
You like a lecher out of whorish loins,32
Both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more;,32
You are too bitter to your countrywoman.,32
For every false drop in her bawdy veins,32
Of her contaminated carrion weight,32
She hath not given so many good words breath,32
Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do,32
But we in silence hold this virtue well,32
Here lies our way.,32
SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.,32
Dear trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.,32
He shall unbolt the gates.,32
To bed to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,32
As infants' empty of all thought!,32
I prithee now to bed.,32
O Cressida! but that the busy day,32
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,32
Night hath been too brief.,32
As tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love,32
You will catch cold and curse me.,32
You men will never tarry.,32
And then you would have tarried. Hark!,32
[Within]  What 's all the doors open here?,32
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:,32
Enter PANDARUS,32
maid! where's my cousin Cressid?,32
You bring me to do and then you flout me too.,32
what: what have I brought you to do?,32
Nor suffer others.,32
hast not slept to-night? would he not a naughty,32
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!,32
Who's that at door? good uncle go and see.,32
You smile and mock me as if I meant naughtily.,32
Come you are deceived I think of no such thing.,32
How earnestly they knock! Pray you come in:,32
Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA,32
down the door? How now! what's the matter?,32
Good morrow lord good morrow.,32
I knew you not: what news with you so early?,32
Here! what should he do here?,32
It doth import him much to speak with me.,32
be sworn: for my own part I came in late. What,32
Who!--nay then: come come you'll do him wrong,32
false to him: do not you know of him but yet go,32
Re-enter TROILUS,32
My lord I scarce have leisure to salute you,32
Paris your brother and Deiphobus,32
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,32
We must give up to Diomedes' hand,32
Is it so concluded?,32
They are at hand and ready to effect it.,32
I will go meet them: and my Lord AEneas,32
Good good my lord; the secrets of nature,32
Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS,32
take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a,32
Re-enter CRESSIDA,32
Ah ah!,32
Tell me sweet uncle what's the matter?,32
O the gods! what's the matter?,32
born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O poor,32
Good uncle I beseech you on my knees! beseech you,32
Thou must be gone wench thou must be gone; thou,32
and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;,32
O you immortal gods! I will not go.,32
I will not uncle: I have forgot my father;,32
No kin no love no blood no soul so near me,32
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,32
Do to this body what extremes you can;,32
Is as the very centre of the earth,32
Do do.,32
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,32
Exeunt,32
Enter PARIS TROILUS AENEAS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR and DIOMEDES,32
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek,32
Tell you the lady what she is to do,32
Walk into her house;,32
And to his hand when I deliver her,32
A priest there offering to it his own heart.,32
I know what 'tis to love;,32
Please you walk in my lords.,32
SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.,32
Be moderate be moderate.,32
The grief is fine full perfect that I taste,32
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?,32
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,32
My love admits no qualifying dross;,32
Here here here he comes.,32
Ah sweet ducks!,32
Embracing him,32
Let me embrace too. 'O heart' as the goodly saying is,32
Why sigh'st thou without breaking?,32
Because thou canst not ease thy smart,32
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away,32
verse: we see it we see it. How now lambs?,32
That the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy,32
Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me.,32
Ay ay ay ay; 'tis too plain a case.,32
A hateful truth.,32
From Troy and Troilus.,32
And suddenly; where injury of chance,32
All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips,32
Our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows,32
We two that with so many thousand sighs,32
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.,32
Crams his rich thievery up he knows not how:,32
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,32
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,32
[Within]  My lord is the lady ready?,32
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.,32
Where are my tears? rain to lay this wind or,32
Exit,32
No remedy.,32
When shall we see again?,32
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?,32
For it is parting from us:,32
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,32
But 'be thou true' say I to fashion in,32
And I will see thee.,32
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.,32
And you this glove. When shall I see you?,32
To give thee nightly visitation.,32
O heavens! 'be true' again!,32
The Grecian youths are full of quality;,32
Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:,32
Alas a kind of godly jealousy--,32
Makes me afeard.,32
Die I a villain then!,32
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,32
Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,32
But I can tell that in each grace of these,32
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.,32
No.,32
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,32
Presuming on their changeful potency.,32
Come kiss; and let us part.,32
Good brother come you hither;,32
My lord will you be true?,32
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,32
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,32
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit,32
Enter AENEAS PARIS ANTENOR DEIPHOBUS and DIOMEDES,32
Which for Antenor we deliver you:,32
And by the way possess thee what she is.,32
If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,32
As Priam is in Ilion.,32
So please you save the thanks this prince expects:,32
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed,32
Grecian thou dost not use me courteously,32
In praising her: I tell thee lord of Greece,32
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.,32
For by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not,32
I'll cut thy throat.,32
Let me be privileged by my place and message,32
I'll answer to my lust: and know you lord,32
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so',32
Come to the port. I'll tell thee Diomed,32
Lady give me your hand and as we walk,32
Exeunt TROILUS CRESSIDA and DIOMEDES,32
Hark! Hector's trumpet.,32
The prince must think me tardy and remiss,32
Tis Troilus' fault: come come to field with him.,32
Yea with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,32
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie,32
Exeunt,32
Enter AJAX armed; AGAMEMNON ACHILLES PATROCLUS MENELAUS ULYSSES NESTOR and others,32
Anticipating time with starting courage.,32
Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air,32
And hale him hither.,32
Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe:,32
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:,32
Thou blow'st for Hector.,32
No trumpet answers.,32
Is not yond Diomed with Calchas' daughter?,32
He rises on the toe: that spirit of his,32
Enter DIOMEDES with CRESSIDA,32
Even she.,32
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.,32
Twere better she were kiss'd in general.,32
So much for Nestor.,32
Achilles bids you welcome.,32
But that's no argument for kissing now;,32
And parted thus you and your argument.,32
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.,32
Patroclus kisses you.,32
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.,32
In kissing do you render or receive?,32
I'll make my match to live,32
Therefore no kiss.,32
You're an odd man; give even or give none.,32
No Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,32
You fillip me o' the head.,32
It were no match your nail against his horn.,32
You may.,32
Why beg then.,32
When Helen is a maid again and his.,32
Never's my day and then a kiss of you.,32
Exit with CRESSIDA,32
Fie fie upon her!,32
Nay her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out,32
O these encounterers so glib of tongue,32
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts,32
For sluttish spoils of opportunity,32
Trumpet within,32
Yonder comes the troop.,32
Hail all you state of Greece! what shall be done,32
A victor shall be known? will you the knights,32
Pursue each other or shall be divided,32
Hector bade ask.,32
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.,32
A little proudly and great deal misprizing,32
If not Achilles sir,32
If not Achilles nothing.,32
In the extremity of great and little,32
The one almost as infinite as all,32
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.,32
In love whereof half Hector stays at home;,32
This blended knight half Trojan and half Greek.,32
Re-enter DIOMEDES,32
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas,32
So be it; either to the uttermost,32
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.,32
They are opposed already.,32
The youngest son of Priam a true knight,32
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;,32
His heart and hand both open and both free;,32
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,32
Manly as Hector but more dangerous;,32
To tender objects but he in heat of action,32
They call him Troilus and on him erect,32
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth,32
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.,32
They are in action.,32
Hector thou sleep'st;,32
His blows are well disposed: there Ajax!,32
Trumpets cease,32
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.,32
Why then will I no more:,32
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;,32
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:,32
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,32
All Greek and this all Troy; my mother's blood,32
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,32
Wherein my sword had not impressure made,32
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,32
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee Ajax:,32
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:,32
I thank thee Hector,32
I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence,32
Not Neoptolemus so mirable,32
Cries 'This is he' could promise to himself,32
There is expectance here from both the sides,32
We'll answer it;,32
If I might in entreaties find success--,32
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.,32
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.,32
And signify this loving interview,32
Desire them home. Give me thy hand my cousin;,32
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.,32
But for Achilles mine own searching eyes,32
Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one,32
But that's no welcome: understand more clear,32
And formless ruin of oblivion;,32
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,32
From heart of very heart great Hector welcome.,32
[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy no,32
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:,32
Who must we answer?,32
O you my lord? by Mars his gauntlet thanks!,32
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:,32
Name her not now sir; she's a deadly theme.,32
I have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oft,32
Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee,32
Despising many forfeits and subduements,32
Not letting it decline on the declined,32
Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life!',32
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,32
But this thy countenance still lock'd in steel,32
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;,32
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;,32
Tis the old Nestor.,32
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:,32
I would my arms could match thee in contention,32
I would they could.,32
By this white beard I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.,32
I wonder now how yonder city stands,32
I know your favour Lord Ulysses well.,32
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed,32
Sir I foretold you then what would ensue:,32
For yonder walls that pertly front your town,32
Must kiss their own feet.,32
There they stand yet and modestly I think,32
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,32
Will one day end it.,32
Most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome:,32
To feast with me and see me at my tent.,32
Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee;,32
And quoted joint by joint.,32
I am Achilles.,32
Behold thy fill.,32
Thou art too brief: I will the second time,32
O like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;,32
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?,32
Shall I destroy him? whether there or there or there?,32
And make distinct the very breach whereout,32
It would discredit the blest gods proud man,32
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly,32
Where thou wilt hit me dead?,32
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,32
For I'll not kill thee there nor there nor there;,32
I'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er.,32
His insolence draws folly from my lips;,32
Or may I never--,32
And you Achilles let these threats alone,32
You may have every day enough of Hector,32
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.,32
We have had pelting wars since you refused,32
Dost thou entreat me Hector?,32
To-night all friends.,32
First all you peers of Greece go to my tent;,32
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall,32
Beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow,32
Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES,32
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?,32
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;,32
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view,32
Shall sweet lord be bound to you so much,32
To bring me thither?,32
As gentle tell me of what honour was,32
That wails her absence?,32
A mock is due. Will you walk on my lord?,32
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.,32
ACT V,32
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS,32
Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.,32
Here comes Thersites.,32
How now thou core of envy!,32
Why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol,32
From whence fragment?,32
Who keeps the tent now?,32
Well said adversity! and what need these tricks?,32
thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.,32
Why his masculine whore. Now the rotten diseases,32
loads o' gravel i' the back lethargies cold,32
lungs bladders full of imposthume sciaticas,32
rivelled fee-simple of the tetter take and take,32
Why thou damnable box of envy thou what meanest,32
Do I curse thee?,32
indistinguishable cur no.,32
immaterial skein of sleave-silk thou green sarcenet,32
purse thou? Ah how the poor world is pestered,32
Out gall!,32
My sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite,32
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,32
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep,32
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;,32
Come come Thersites help to trim my tent:,32
Away Patroclus!,32
With too much blood and too little brain these two,32
little blood they do I'll be a curer of madmen.,32
that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as,32
there his brother the bull--the primitive statue,32
shoeing-horn in a chain hanging at his brother's,32
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?,32
an ox were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a,32
owl a puttock or a herring without a roe I would,32
against destiny. Ask me not what I would be if I,32
of a lazar so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!,32
Enter HECTOR TROILUS AJAX AGAMEMNON ULYSSES NESTOR MENELAUS and DIOMEDES with lights,32
No yonder 'tis;,32
I trouble you.,32
Here comes himself to guide you.,32
Welcome brave Hector; welcome princes all.,32
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.,32
Good night my lord.,32
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,32
Good night and welcome both at once to those,32
Good night.,32
Old Nestor tarries; and you too Diomed,32
I cannot lord; I have important business,32
Give me your hand.,32
Calchas' tent:,32
Sweet sir you honour me.,32
Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following,32
Exeunt ACHILLES HECTOR AJAX and NESTOR,32
unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers,32
his mouth and promise like Brabbler the hound:,32
is prodigious there will come some change; the sun,32
word. I will rather leave to see Hector than,32
drab and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll,32
Exit,32
Enter DIOMEDES,32
[Within]  Who calls?,32
[Within]  She comes to you.,32
Stand where the torch may not discover us.,32
Cressid comes forth to him.,32
Now my sweet guardian! Hark a word with you.,32
Yea so familiar!,32
And any man may sing her if he can take her cliff;,32
Will you remember?,32
Nay but do then;,32
What should she remember?,32
Sweet honey Greek tempt me no more to folly.,32
Nay then--,32
Foh foh! come tell a pin: you are forsworn.,32
A juggling trick--to be secretly open.,32
I prithee do not hold me to mine oath;,32
Good night.,32
How now Trojan!,32
No no good night: I'll be your fool no more.,32
Hark one word in your ear.,32
You are moved prince; let us depart I pray you,32
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;,32
Behold I pray you!,32
You flow to great distraction; come my lord.,32
You have not patience; come.,32
I will not speak a word!,32
Nay but you part in anger.,32
O wither'd truth!,32
By Jove,32
Guardian!--why Greek!,32
In faith I do not: come hither once again.,32
You will break out.,32
Come come.,32
There is between my will and all offences,32
How the devil Luxury with his fat rump and,32
But will you then?,32
Give me some token for the surety of it.,32
Exit,32
Fear me not sweet lord;,32
Of what I feel: I am all patience.,32
Now the pledge; now now now!,32
O beauty! where is thy faith?,32
I will be patient; outwardly I will.,32
He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.,32
It is no matter now I have't again.,32
I prithee Diomed visit me no more.,32
I shall have it.,32
Ay that.,32
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed,32
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,32
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.,32
I did swear patience.,32
I'll give you something else.,32
It is no matter.,32
Twas one's that loved me better than you will.,32
Whose was it?,32
And by herself I will not tell you whose.,32
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.,32
It should be challenged.,32
I will not keep my word.,32
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.,32
But it straight starts you.,32
Nor I by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.,32
Ay come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.,32
Good night: I prithee come.,32
Troilus farewell! one eye yet looks on thee,32
Ah poor our sex! this fault in us I find,32
What error leads must err; O then conclude,32
Exit,32
Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.',32
It is.,32
To make a recordation to my soul,32
But if I tell how these two did co-act,32
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,32
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,32
Created only to calumniate.,32
I cannot conjure Trojan.,32
Most sure she was.,32
Nor mine my lord: Cressid was here but now.,32
Think we had mothers; do not give advantage,32
For depravation to square the general sex,32
What hath she done prince that can soil our mothers?,32
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?,32
If beauty have a soul this is not she;,32
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,32
This is not she. O madness of discourse,32
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt,32
Without revolt: this is and is not Cressid.,32
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate,32
And yet the spacious breadth of this division,32
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.,32
Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven:,32
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolved and loosed;,32
The fractions of her faith orts of her love,32
Of her o'er-eaten faith are bound to Diomed.,32
With that which here his passion doth express?,32
In characters as red as Mars his heart,32
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.,32
So much by weight hate I her Diomed:,32
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,32
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,32
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear,32
Falling on Diomed.,32
O Cressid! O false Cressid! false false false!,32
And they'll seem glorious.,32
Your passion draws ears hither.,32
I have been seeking you this hour my lord:,32
Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home.,32
Farewell revolted fair! and Diomed,32
I'll bring you to the gates.,32
Exeunt TROILUS AENEAS and ULYSSES,32
croak like a raven; I would bode I would bode.,32
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not,32
Lechery lechery; still wars and lechery; nothing,32
Exit,32
Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE,32
To stop his ears against admonishment?,32
You train me to offend you; get you in:,32
My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day.,32
Enter CASSANDRA,32
Here sister; arm'd and bloody in intent.,32
Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd,32
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.,32
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!,32
Be gone I say: the gods have heard me swear.,32
They are polluted offerings more abhorr'd,32
O be persuaded! do not count it holy,32
For we would give much to use violent thefts,32
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;,32
Unarm sweet Hector.,32
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:,32
Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.,32
How now young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?,32
Exit CASSANDRA,32
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:,32
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.,32
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.,32
Which better fits a lion than a man.,32
When many times the captive Grecian falls,32
You bid them rise and live.,32
Fool's play by heaven Hector.,32
For the love of all the gods,32
And when we have our armours buckled on,32
Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth.,32
Hector then 'tis wars.,32
Who should withhold me?,32
Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;,32
Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;,32

To close the day up Hector's life is done.,32
Strike fellows strike; this is the man I seek.,32
So Ilion fall thou next! now Troy sink down!,32

SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.,33
If music be the food of love play on;,33
The appetite may sicken and so die.,33
O it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,33
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:,33
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,33
Receiveth as the sea nought enters there,33
But falls into abatement and low price,33
That it alone is high fantastical.,33
What Curio?,33
Why so I do the noblest that I have:,33
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!,33
And my desires like fell and cruel hounds,33
Enter VALENTINE,33
So please my lord I might not be admitted;,33
The element itself till seven years' heat,33
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,33
With eye-offending brine: all this to season,33
And lasting in her sad remembrance.,33
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,33
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else,33
These sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd,33
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:,33
Exeunt,33
Enter VIOLA a Captain and Sailors,33
This is Illyria lady.,33
My brother he is in Elysium.,33
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.,33
True madam: and to comfort you with chance,33
When you and those poor number saved with you,33
Most provident in peril bind himself,33
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;,33
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves,33
For saying so there's gold:,33
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,33
Ay madam well; for I was bred and born,33
Who governs here?,33
What is the name?,33
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:,33
And so is now or was so very late;,33
And then 'twas fresh in murmur--as you know,33
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.,33
A virtuous maid the daughter of a count,33
In the protection of his son her brother,33
They say she hath abjured the company,33
O that I served that lady,33
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,33
That were hard to compass;,33
No not the duke's.,33
And though that nature with a beauteous wall,33
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits,33
I prithee and I'll pay thee bounteously,33
For such disguise as haply shall become,33
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:,33
And speak to him in many sorts of music,33
What else may hap to time I will commit;,33
Be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be:,33
I thank thee: lead me on.,33
SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.,33
What a plague means my niece to take the death of,33
By my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier o',33
exceptions to your ill hours.,33
Ay but you must confine yourself within the modest,33
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:,33
these boots too: an they be not let them hang,33
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard,33
knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.,33
Ay he.,33
What's that to the purpose?,33
Ay but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:,33
Fie that you'll say so! he plays o' the,33
word for word without book and hath all the good,33
He hath indeed almost natural: for besides that,33
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he,33
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.,33
that say so of him. Who are they?,33
With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to,33
drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill,33
o' the toe like a parish-top. What wench!,33
Enter SIR ANDREW,33
Sweet Sir Andrew!,33
And you too sir.,33
What's that?,33
Good Mistress Accost I desire better acquaintance.,33
Good Mistress Mary Accost--,33

company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?,33
An thou let part so Sir Andrew would thou mightst,33
An you part so mistress I would I might never,33
fools in hand?,33
Marry but you shall have; and here's my hand.,33
your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.,33
It's dry sir.,33
keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?,33
Are you full of them?,33
now I let go your hand I am barren.,33
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I,33
Never in your life I think; unless you see canary,33
than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a,33
No question.,33
to-morrow Sir Toby.,33
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had,33
fencing dancing and bear-baiting: O had I but,33
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.,33
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.,33
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I,33
and spin it off.,33
will not be seen; or if she be it's four to one,33
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above,33
have heard her swear't. Tut there's life in't,33
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the,33
and revels sometimes altogether.,33
As any man in Illyria whatsoever he be under the,33
with an old man.,33
Faith I can cut a caper.,33
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong,33
Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have,33
take dust like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost,33
a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not,33
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?,33
leg it was formed under the star of a galliard.,33
flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?,33
Taurus! That's sides and heart.,33
caper; ha! higher: ha ha! excellent!,33
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.,33
If the duke continue these favours towards you,33
known you but three days and already you are no stranger.,33
you call in question the continuance of his love:,33
No believe me.,33
Enter DUKE ORSINO CURIO and Attendants,33
On your attendance my lord; here.,33
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd,33
Therefore good youth address thy gait unto her;,33
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow,33
Sure my noble lord,33
As it is spoke she never will admit me.,33
Rather than make unprofited return.,33
O then unfold the passion of my love,33
It shall become thee well to act my woes;,33
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.,33
Dear lad believe it;,33
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip,33
Is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound,33
I know thy constellation is right apt,33
All if you will; for I myself am best,33
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,33
I'll do my best,33
Aside,33
Whoe'er I woo myself would be his wife.,33
SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.,33
Nay either tell me where thou hast been or I will,33
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.,33
world needs to fear no colours.,33
He shall see none to fear.,33
saying was born of 'I fear no colours.',33
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.,33
that are fools let them use their talents.,33
to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you?,33
for turning away let summer bear it out.,33
Not so neither; but I am resolved on two points.,33
break your gaskins fall.,33
Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a,33
Peace you rogue no more o' that. Here comes my,33
Exit,33
Those wits that think they have thee do very oft,33
pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?,33
Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO,33
Take the fool away.,33
Go to you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:,33
Two faults madonna that drink and good counsel,33
the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend,33
he cannot let the botcher mend him. Any thing,33
transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that,33
simple syllogism will serve so; if it will not,33
calamity so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take,33
Sir I bade them take away you.,33
facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not,33
prove you a fool.,33
Dexterously good madonna.,33
I must catechise you for it madonna: good my mouse,33
Well sir for want of other idleness I'll bide your proof.,33
Good fool for my brother's death.,33
I know his soul is in heaven fool.,33
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool gentlemen.,33
Yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:,33
better fool.,33
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be,33
word for two pence that you are no fool.,33
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a,33
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain,33
already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to,33
that crow so at these set kind of fools no better,33
Oh you are sick of self-love Malvolio and taste,33
guiltless and of free disposition is to take those,33
there is no slander in an allowed fool though he do,33
man though he do nothing but reprove.,33
speakest well of fools!,33
Madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much,33
From the Count Orsino is it?,33
Who of my people hold him in delay?,33
Fetch him off I pray you; he speaks nothing but,33
Exit MARIA,33
am sick or not at home; what you will to dismiss it.,33
Now you see sir how your fooling grows old and,33
Thou hast spoke for us madonna as if thy eldest,33
brains! for--here he comes--one of thy kin has a,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH,33
A gentleman.,33
Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these,33
Good Sir Toby!,33
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.,33
Let him be the devil an he will I care not: give,33
Exit,33
Like a drowned man a fool and a mad man: one,33
him; and a third drowns him.,33
coz; for he's in the third degree of drink he's,33
He is but mad yet madonna; and the fool shall look,33
Exit,33
Madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with,33
understand so much and therefore comes to speak,33
have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore,33
lady? he's fortified against any denial.,33
Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your,33
a bench but he'll speak with you.,33
Why of mankind.,33
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you will you or no.,33
Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for,33
cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him,33
well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one,33
Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.,33
Exit,33
Give me my veil: come throw it o'er my face.,33
Enter VIOLA and Attendants,33
Speak to me; I shall answer for her.,33
Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty--I,33
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away,33
penned I have taken great pains to con it. Good,33
comptible even to the least sinister usage.,33
I can say little more than I have studied and that,33
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,33
Are you a comedian?,33
of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are you,33
If I do not usurp myself I am.,33
yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours,33
on with my speech in your praise and then show you,33
Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.,33
It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,33
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you,33
you have reason be brief: 'tis not that time of,33
Will you hoist sail sir? here lies your way.,33
longer. Some mollification for your giant sweet,33
Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when,33
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of,33
hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.,33
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I,33
would are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,33
Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.,33
Now sir what is your text?,33
A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it.,33
In Orsino's bosom.,33
To answer by the method in the first of his heart.,33
Good madam let me see your face.,33
with my face? You are now out of your text: but,33
Look you sir such a one I was this present: is't,33
Unveiling,33
Tis in grain sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.,33
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:,33
If you will lead these graces to the grave,33
O sir I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give,33
inventoried and every particle and utensil,33
indifferent red; item two grey eyes with lids to,33
you sent hither to praise me?,33
But if you were the devil you are fair.,33
Could be but recompensed though you were crown'd,33
How does he love me?,33
With groans that thunder love with sighs of fire.,33
Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble,33
In voices well divulged free learn'd and valiant;,33
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;,33
If I did love you in my master's flame,33
In your denial I would find no sense;,33
Why what would you?,33
And call upon my soul within the house;,33
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;,33
And make the babbling gossip of the air,33
Between the elements of air and earth,33
You might do much.,33
Above my fortunes yet my state is well:,33
Get you to your lord;,33
Unless perchance you come to me again,33
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.,33
My master not myself lacks recompense.,33
And let your fervor like my master's be,33
Exit,33
Above my fortunes yet my state is well:,33
Thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit,33
soft soft!,33
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?,33
With an invisible and subtle stealth,33
What ho Malvolio!,33
Here madam at your service.,33
The county's man: he left this ring behind him,33
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,33
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,33
Madam I will.,33
I do I know not what and fear to find,33
Fate show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;,33
Exit,33
SCENE I. The sea-coast.,33
Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?,33

leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad,33
ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.,33
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a,33
what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges,33
must know of me then Antonio my name is Sebastian,33
Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard,33
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,33
for some hour before you took me from the breach of,33
Alas the day!,33
me was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,33
overfar believe that yet thus far I will boldly,33
call fair. She is drowned already sir with salt,33
Pardon me sir your bad entertainment.,33
If you will not murder me for my love let me be,33
If you will not undo what you have done that is,33
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,33
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell,33
Exit,33
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,33
But come what may I do adore thee so,33
Exit,33

Even now sir; on a moderate pace I have since,33
She returns this ring to you sir: you might have,33
She adds moreover that you should put your lord,33

your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.,33
Come sir you peevishly threw it to her; and her,33
stooping for there it lies in your eye; if not be,33
Exit,33
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!,33
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,33
She loves me sure; the cunning of her passion,33
None of my lord's ring! why he sent her none.,33
Poor lady she were better love a dream.,33
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.,33
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!,33
For such as we are made of such we be.,33
And I poor monster fond as much on him;,33

As I am woman--now alas the day!--,33

thing more than contempt you would not give means,33
Exit,33
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's,33
break promise with him and make a fool of him.,33
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.,33
youth of the count's was today with thy lady she is,33
alone with him: if I do not gull him into a,33
think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:,33
Possess us possess us; tell us something of him.,33
O if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!,33
dear knight?,33
good enough.,33
constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,33
swarths: the best persuaded of himself so,33
his grounds of faith that all that look on him love,33
notable cause to work.,33
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of,33
of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure,33
himself most feelingly personated. I can write very,33
can hardly make distinction of our hands.,33
I have't in my nose too.,33
that they come from my niece and that she's in,33
My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.,33
Ass I doubt not.,33
Sport royal I warrant you: I know my physic will,33
fool make a third where he shall find the letter:,33
bed and dream on the event. Farewell.,33
Good night Penthesilea.,33
She's a beagle true-bred and one that adores me:,33
I was adored once too.,33

Send for money knight: if thou hast her not i',33
If I do not never trust me take it how you will.,33
to go to bed now: come knight; come knight.,33
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.,33
Give me some music. Now good morrow friends.,33
That old and antique song we heard last night:,33
More than light airs and recollected terms,33
Come but one verse.,33
Who was it?,33
Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.,33
Exit CURIO. Music plays,33
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;,33
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,33
That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?,33
Where Love is throned.,33
My life upon't young though thou art thine eye,33
Hath it not boy?,33
What kind of woman is't?,33
She is not worth thee then. What years i' faith?,33
Too old by heaven: let still the woman take,33
So sways she level in her husband's heart:,33
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,33
Than women's are.,33
Then let thy love be younger than thyself,33
For women are as roses whose fair flower,33
And so they are: alas that they are so;,33
Re-enter CURIO and Clown,33
Mark it Cesario it is old and plain;,33
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,33
And dallies with the innocence of love,33
Are you ready sir?,33
Music,33
Come away come away death,33
Fly away fly away breath;,33
My shroud of white stuck all with yew,33
My part of death no one so true,33
Not a flower not a flower sweet,33
Not a friend not a friend greet,33
A thousand thousand sighs to save,33
Sad true lover never find my grave,33
There's for thy pains.,33
I'll pay thy pleasure then.,33
Give me now leave to leave thee.,33
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for,33
constancy put to sea that their business might be,33
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.,33
Let all the rest give place.,33
Once more Cesario,33
Tell her my love more noble than the world,33
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,33
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems,33
But if she cannot love you sir?,33
Sooth but you must.,33
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart,33
You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?,33
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion,33
So big to hold so much; they lack retention,33
No motion of the liver but the palate,33
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,33
Between that love a woman can bear me,33
Ay but I know--,33
Too well what love women to men may owe:,33
My father had a daughter loved a man,33
I should your lordship.,33
A blank my lord. She never told her love,33
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,33
She sat like patience on a monument,33
We men may say more swear more: but indeed,33
Much in our vows but little in our love.,33
I am all the daughters of my father's house,33
Sir shall I to this lady?,33
To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,33
Exeunt,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and FABIAN,33
Nay I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,33
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly,33
I would exult man: you know he brought me out o',33
To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will,33
An we do not it is pity of our lives.,33
Enter MARIA,33
Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's,33
sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half,33
know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of,33
Throws down a letter,33
Exit,33
Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told,33
thus near that should she fancy it should be one,33
exalted respect than any one else that follows her.,33
Here's an overweening rogue!,33
of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!,33
Peace I say.,33
Ah rogue!,33
Peace peace!,33
married the yeoman of the wardrobe.,33
O peace! now he's deeply in: look how,33
Having been three months married to her sitting in,33
O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!,33
gown; having come from a day-bed where I have left,33
Fire and brimstone!,33
And then to have the humour of state; and after a,33
place as I would they should do theirs to for my,33
Bolts and shackles!,33
Seven of my people with an obedient start make,33
up watch or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby,33
Shall this fellow live?,33
I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar,33
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?,33
your niece give me this prerogative of speech'--,33
You must amend your drunkenness.',33
Nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot.,33
a foolish knight'--,33
One Sir Andrew'--,33
What employment have we here?,33
Now is the woodcock near the gin.,33
aloud to him!,33
very C's her U's and her T's and thus makes she her,33
Her C's her U's and her T's: why that?,33
wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave wax.,33
uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?,33
[Reads],33
Lips do not move;,33
No man must know.' What follows? the numbers,33
thee Malvolio?,33
[Reads],33
But silence like a Lucrece knife,33
M O A I doth sway my life.,33
Excellent wench say I.,33
me see let me see let me see.,33
And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!,33
me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why this is,33
obstruction in this: and the end--what should,33
that resemble something in me--Softly! M O A,33
O ay make up that: he is now at a cold scent.,33
rank as a fox.,33
Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is,33
M--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;,33
And O shall end I hope.,33
And then I comes behind.,33
more detraction at your heels than fortunes before,33
M O A I; this simulation is not as the former: and,33
every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!,33
Reads,33
am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some,33
have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open,33
and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,33
opposite with a kinsman surly with servants; let,33
the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee,33
yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever,33
made if thou desirest to be so; if not let me see,33
not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.,33
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.',33

acquaintance I will be point-devise the very man.,33

late she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;,33
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits,33
be strange stout in yellow stockings and,33
on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a,33
Reads,33
entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling;,33
presence still smile dear my sweet I prithee.',33
everything that thou wilt have me.,33
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension,33
I could marry this wench for this device.,33
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.,33
Here comes my noble gull-catcher.,33
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?,33
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip and become thy,33
I' faith or I either?,33
the image of it leaves him he must run mad.,33
Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.,33
his first approach before my lady: he will come to,33
abhors and cross-gartered a fashion she detests;,33
unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a,33
into a notable contempt. If you will see it follow,33
To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit!,33
Exeunt,33
SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.,33
Save thee friend and thy music: dost thou live by,33
No sir I live by the church.,33
No such matter sir: I do live by the church; for,33
the church.,33
beggar dwell near him; or the church stands by thy,33
You have said sir. To see this age! A sentence is,33
wrong side may be turned outward!,33
words may quickly make them wanton.,33
Why man?,33
word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words,33
Thy reason man?,33
words are grown so false I am loath to prove,33
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.,33
conscience sir I do not care for you: if that be,33
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?,33
will keep no fool sir till she be married; and,33
herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not,33
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.,33
it shines every where. I would be sorry sir but,33
my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.,33
Hold there's expenses for thee.,33
By my troth I'll tell thee I am almost sick for,33
Aside,33
lady within?,33
Yes being kept together and put to use.,33
a Cressida to this Troilus.,33
The matter I hope is not great sir begging but,33
within sir. I will construe to them whence you,33
welkin I might say 'element' but the word is over-worn.,33
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;,33
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,33
And like the haggard cheque at every feather,33
As full of labour as a wise man's art,33
But wise men folly-fall'n quite taint their wit.,33
Save you gentleman.,33
Dieu vous garde monsieur.,33
I hope sir you are; and I am yours.,33
you should enter if your trade be to her.,33

My legs do better understand me sir than I,33
I mean to go sir to enter.,33

Most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain,33
That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.,33
and vouchsafed ear.,33

Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and MARIA,33
My duty madam and most humble service.,33
Cesario is your servant's name fair princess.,33
Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:,33
And he is yours and his must needs be yours:,33
For him I think not on him: for his thoughts,33
Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts,33
O by your leave I pray you,33
But would you undertake another suit,33
Than music from the spheres.,33
Give me leave beseech you. I did send,33
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse,33
Under your hard construction must I sit,33
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?,33
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts,33
Enough is shown: a cypress not a bosom,33
I pity you.,33
No not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,33
Why then methinks 'tis time to smile again.,33
If one should be a prey how much the better,33
Clock strikes,33
Be not afraid good youth I will not have you:,33
Your were is alike to reap a proper man:,33
Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition,33
You'll nothing madam to my lord by me?,33
I prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me.,33
If I think so I think the same of you.,33
I would you were as I would have you be!,33
I wish it might for now I am your fool.,33
In the contempt and anger of his lip!,33
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.,33
By maidhood honour truth and every thing,33
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.,33
For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause,33
Love sought is good but given unsought better.,33
I have one heart one bosom and one truth,33
Shall mistress be of it save I alone.,33
Will I my master's tears to you deplore.,33
That heart which now abhors to like his love.,33
SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.,33
No faith I'll not stay a jot longer.,33
You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew.,33
count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;,33
Did she see thee the while old boy? tell me that.,33
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.,33
I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of,33
And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah,33
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only,33
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.,33
excellent jests fire-new from the mint you should,33
looked for at your hand and this was balked: the,33
off and you are now sailed into the north of my,33
on a Dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by,33
An't be any way it must be with valour; for policy,33
politician.,33
valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight,33
take note of it; and assure thyself there is no,33
commendation with woman than report of valour.,33
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?,33
it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun,33
if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be,33
paper although the sheet were big enough for the,33
Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou,33
Where shall I find you?,33
Exit SIR ANDREW,33
I have been dear to him lad some two thousand,33
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll,33
Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the,33
cannot hale them together. For Andrew if he were,33
will clog the foot of a flea I'll eat the rest of,33
And his opposite the youth bears in his visage no,33
Enter MARIA,33
If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourself,33
turned heathen a very renegado; for there is no,33
rightly can ever believe such impossible passages,33
And cross-gartered?,33
i' the church. I have dogged him like his,33
that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his,33
augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such,33
at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,33
Come bring us bring us where he is.,33
SCENE III. A street.,33
I would not by my will have troubled you;,33
I will no further chide you.,33
More sharp than filed steel did spur me forth;,33
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,33
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,33
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,33
Set forth in your pursuit.,33
I can no other answer make but thanks,33
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:,33
You should find better dealing. What's to do?,33
To-morrow sir: best first go see your lodging.,33
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes,33
That do renown this city.,33
I do not without danger walk these streets:,33
I did some service; of such note indeed,33
Belike you slew great number of his people.,33
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel,33
It might have since been answer'd in repaying,33
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;,33
I shall pay dear.,33
It doth not fit me. Hold sir here's my purse.,33
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,33
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.,33
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy,33
I think is not for idle markets sir.,33
For an hour.,33
I do remember.,33
SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.,33
I have sent after him: he says he'll come;,33
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.,33
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,33
Where is Malvolio?,33
is sure possessed madam.,33
No. madam he does nothing but smile: your,33
he come; for sure the man is tainted in's wits.,33
Exit MARIA,33
If sad and merry madness equal be.,33
How now Malvolio!,33
Smilest thou?,33
Sad lady! I could be sad: this does make some,33
what of that? if it please the eye of one it is,33
please all.',33
Not black in my mind though yellow in my legs. It,33
executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.,33
To bed! ay sweet-heart and I'll come to thee.,33
thy hand so oft?,33
At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.,33
Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.,33
Some are born great'--,33
Some achieve greatness'--,33
And some have greatness thrust upon them.',33
Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s'--,33
And wished to see thee cross-gartered.',33
Go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so;'--,33
If not let me see thee a servant still.',33
Enter Servant,33

I'll come to him.,33
Good Maria let this fellow be looked to. Where's,33
care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the,33
Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA,33

Here he is here he is. How is't with you sir?,33
Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go,33
Lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not,33
care of him.,33
Go to go to; peace peace; we must deal gently,33

Do you know what you say?,33

Marry and it shall be done to-morrow morning if I,33
How now mistress!,33
Prithee hold thy peace; this is not the way: do,33
No way but gentleness; gently gently: the fiend is,33
Why how now my bawcock! how dost thou chuck?,33
Ay Biddy come with me. What man! 'tis not for,33

My prayers minx!,33
Go hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow,33

Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint.,33
The house will be the quieter.,33

Very brief and to exceeding good sense--less.,33

more approbation than ever proof itself would have,33
Nay let me alone for swearing.,33
Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior,33
capacity and breeding; his employment between his,33
letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no,33
clodpole. But sir I will deliver his challenge by,33
of valour; and drive the gentleman as I know his,33
opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity.,33

Here he comes with your niece: give them way till,33
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message,33
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH FABIAN and MARIA,33
And laid mine honour too unchary out:,33
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,33
With the same 'havior that your passion bears,33
Here wear this jewel for me 'tis my picture;,33
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.,33
That honour saved may upon asking give?,33
How with mine honour may I give him that,33
I will acquit you.,33
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.,33
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN,33
And you sir.,33
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know,33
the hunter attends thee at the orchard-end:,33
thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly.,33

You'll find it otherwise I assure you: therefore,33
your guard; for your opposite hath in him what,33
I pray you sir what is he?,33
carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private,33
his incensement at this moment is so implacable,33
and sepulchre. Hob nob is his word; give't or take't.,33
conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard,33
others to taste their valour: belike this is a man,33
Sir no; his indignation derives itself out of a,33

Pray you sir do you know of this matter?,33

Nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by,33

Pox on't I'll not meddle with him.,33

and I'll give him my horse grey Capilet.,33
on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.,33
Marry I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.,33
To FABIAN,33
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.,33
looks pale as if a bear were at his heels.,33

scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw for,33
[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would,33
Give ground if you see him furious.,33

promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he,33
Pray God he keep his oath!,33
They draw,33
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman,33
If you offend him I for him defy you.,33
One sir that for his love dares yet do more,33
Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you.,33
Enter Officers,33
I'll be with you anon.,33
Marry will I sir; and for that I promised you,33

No sir no jot; I know your favour well,33
Take him away: he knows I know him well.,33

But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.,33
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me,33
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;,33
Come sir away.,33
What money sir?,33
And part being prompted by your present trouble,33
I'll lend you something: my having is not much;,33
Hold there's half my coffer.,33
Is't possible that my deserts to you,33
Lest that it make me so unsound a man,33
That I have done for you.,33
Nor know I you by voice or any feature:,33
Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness,33
Inhabits our frail blood.,33
Come sir I pray you go.,33
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,33
And to his image which methought did promise,33
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!,33
Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame.,33
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:,33
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.,33
Lead me on.,33
Methinks his words do from such passion fly,33
Prove true imagination O prove true,33
Come hither knight; come hither Fabian: we'll,33
He named Sebastian: I my brother know,33
In favour was my brother and he went,33
For him I imitate: O if it prove,33
Exit,33

Come sir I will not let you go. Come my young,33
I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If,33
What what? Nay then I must have an ounce or two,33
Enter OLIVIA,33
Madam!,33
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,33
Be not offended dear Cesario.,33
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH SIR ANDREW and FABIAN,33
Let thy fair wisdom not thy passion sway,33
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,33
This ruffian hath botch'd up that thou thereby,33
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,33
What relish is in this? how runs the stream?,33
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;,33
Nay come I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!,33
O say so and so be!,33
SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.,33
Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard;,33
it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.,33
Well I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself,33
dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to,33
thought a good student; but to be said an honest man,33
careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.,33
Jove bless thee master Parson.,33
Prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily,33
so I being Master Parson am Master Parson; for,33
To him Sir Topas.,33
The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.,33
Sir Topas the curate who comes to visit Malvolio,33
Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas go to my lady.,33
talkest thou nothing but of ladies?,33
Sir Topas never was man thus wronged: good Sir,33
here in hideous darkness.,33
modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones,33
sayest thou that house is dark?,33
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,33
lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of,33
I am not mad Sir Topas: I say to you this house is dark.,33
but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than,33
I say this house is as dark as ignorance though,33
was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you,33
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?,33
What thinkest thou of his opinion?,33
Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:,33
allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest,33
Sir Topas Sir Topas!,33
Nay I am for all waters.,33
gown: he sees thee not.,33
thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this,33
would he were for I am now so far in offence with,33
sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.,33
[Singing],33
Tell me how thy lady does.',33
My lady is unkind perdy.',33
Alas why is she so?',33
She loves another'--Who calls ha?,33
hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper:,33
thee for't.,33
Ay good fool.,33
Fool there was never a man so notoriously abused: I,33
But as well? then you are mad indeed if you be no,33
They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,33
face me out of my wits.,33
Malvolio Malvolio thy wits the heavens restore!,33
bibble babble.,33
Maintain no words with him good fellow. Who I,33
Merry amen. I will sir I will.,33
Alas sir be patient. What say you sir? I am,33
Good fool help me to some light and some paper: I,33
Well-a-day that you were sir,33
light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:,33
of letter did.,33
not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?,33
Nay I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his,33
Fool I'll requite it in the highest degree: I,33
[Singing],33
And anon sir,33
In a trice,33
Your need to sustain;,33
In his rage and his wrath,33
Like a mad lad,33
Adieu good man devil.,33
SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.,33
This is the air; that is the glorious sun;,33
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,33
I could not find him at the Elephant:,33
That he did range the town to seek me out.,33
For though my soul disputes well with my sense,33
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune,33
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,33
To any other trust but that I am mad,33
She could not sway her house command her followers,33
With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing,33
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.,33
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,33
Into the chantry by: there before him,33
Plight me the full assurance of your faith;,33
May live at peace. He shall conceal it,33
What time we will our celebration keep,33
I'll follow this good man and go with you;,33
Then lead the way good father; and heavens so shine,33
Exeunt,33
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.,33
Now as thou lovest me let me see his letter.,33
Any thing.,33
This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my,33
Enter DUKE ORSINO VIOLA CURIO and Lords,33
Ay sir; we are some of her trappings.,33
Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse,33
Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.,33
How can that be?,33
now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by,33
and by my friends I am abused: so that,33
make your two affirmatives why then the worse for,33
Why this is excellent.,33
one of my friends.,33
But that it would be double-dealing sir I would,33
O you give me ill counsel.,33
and let your flesh and blood obey it.,33
double-dealer: there's another.,33
saying is the third pays for all: the triplex,33
Saint Bennet sir may put you in mind; one two three.,33
if you will let your lady know I am here to speak,33
my bounty further.,33
again. I go sir; but I would not have you to think,33
but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I,33
Exit,33
Enter ANTONIO and Officers,33
Yet when I saw it last it was besmear'd,33
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,33
With which such scathful grapple did he make,33
That very envy and the tongue of loss,33
Orsino this is that Antonio,33
And this is he that did the Tiger board,33
Here in the streets desperate of shame and state,33
He did me kindness sir drew on my side;,33
I know not what 'twas but distraction.,33
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,33
Hast made thine enemies?,33
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:,33
Though I confess on base and ground enough,33
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,33
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:,33
My love without retention or restraint,33
Did I expose myself pure for his love,33
Drew to defend him when he was beset:,33
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,33
And grew a twenty years removed thing,33
Which I had recommended to his use,33
How can this be?,33
To-day my lord; and for three months before,33
Both day and night did we keep company.,33
Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.,33
Three months this youth hath tended upon me;,33
What would my lord but that he may not have,33
Cesario you do not keep promise with me.,33
Gracious Olivia--,33
My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.,33
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear,33
Still so cruel?,33
What to perverseness? you uncivil lady,33
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out,33
Even what it please my lord that shall become him.,33
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,33
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:,33
And that I partly know the instrument,33
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;,33
And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly,33
Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.,33
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,33
And I most jocund apt and willingly,33
Where goes Cesario?,33
More than I love these eyes more than my life,33
If I do feign you witnesses above,33
Ay me detested! how am I beguiled!,33
Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?,33
Come away!,33
Husband!,33
Her husband sirrah!,33
Alas it is the baseness of thy fear,33
Fear not Cesario; take thy fortunes up;,33
As great as that thou fear'st.,33
O welcome father!,33
Here to unfold though lately we intended,33
Reveals before 'tis ripe what thou dost know,33
A contract of eternal bond of love,33
Attested by the holy close of lips,33
And all the ceremony of this compact,33
Since when my watch hath told me toward my grave,33
O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be,33
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,33
Farewell and take her; but direct thy feet,33
My lord I do protest--,33
Hold little faith though thou hast too much fear.,33
For the love of God a surgeon! Send one presently,33
What's the matter?,33
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God your,33
Who has done this Sir Andrew?,33
a coward but he's the very devil incardinate.,33
Od's lifelings here he is! You broke my head for,33
by Sir Toby.,33
You drew your sword upon me without cause;,33
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me: I,33
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown,33
but if he had not been in drink he would have,33
How now gentleman! how is't with you?,33
on't. Sot didst see Dick surgeon sot?,33
were set at eight i' the morning.,33
hate a drunken rogue.,33
I'll help you Sir Toby because well be dressed together.,33
knave a thin-faced knave a gull!,33
Exeunt Clown FABIAN SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW,33
I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman:,33
I must have done no less with wit and safety.,33
I do perceive it hath offended you:,33
We made each other but so late ago.,33
A natural perspective that is and is not!,33
How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,33
Sebastian are you?,33
How have you made division of yourself?,33
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?,33
Do I stand there? I never had a brother;,33
Of here and every where. I had a sister,33
Of charity what kin are you to me?,33
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;,33
So went he suited to his watery tomb:,33
You come to fright us.,33
But am in that dimension grossly clad,33
Were you a woman as the rest goes even,33
And say 'Thrice-welcome drowned Viola!',33
And so had mine.,33
Had number'd thirteen years.,33
He finished indeed his mortal act,33
If nothing lets to make us happy both,33
Do not embrace me till each circumstance,33
That I am Viola: which to confirm,33
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help,33
All the occurrence of my fortune since,33
[To OLIVIA]  So comes it lady you have been mistook:,33
You would have been contracted to a maid;,33
You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.,33
If this be so as yet the glass seems true,33
To VIOLA,33
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.,33
And those swearings keep as true in soul,33
That severs day from night.,33
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.,33
Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action,33
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.,33
And yet alas now I remember me,33
Re-enter Clown with a letter and FABIAN,33
From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.,33
Truly madam he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as,33
letter to you; I should have given't you to-day,33
so it skills not much when they are delivered.,33
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers,33
Reads,33
How now! art thou mad?,33
will have it as it ought to be you must allow Vox.,33
So I do madonna; but to read his right wits is to,33
Read it you sirrah.,33
[Reads]  'By the Lord madam you wrong me and the,33
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over,33
your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced,33
not but to do myself much right or you much shame.,33
unthought of and speak out of my injury.,33
Did he write this?,33
This savours not much of distraction.,33
Exit FABIAN,33
thought on,33
One day shall crown the alliance on't so please you,33
Madam I am most apt to embrace your offer.,33
Your master quits you; and for your service done him,33
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,33
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be,33
A sister! you are she.,33
Is this the madman?,33
How now Malvolio!,33
Notorious wrong.,33
Lady you have. Pray you peruse that letter.,33
Write from it if you can in hand or phrase;,33
You can say none of this: well grant it then,33
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,33
To put on yellow stockings and to frown,33
And acting this in an obedient hope,33
Kept in a dark house visited by the priest,33
That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.,33
Though I confess much like the character,33
And now I do bethink me it was she,33
And in such forms which here were presupposed,33
This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;,33
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge,33
Good madam hear me speak,33
Taint the condition of this present hour,33
Most freely I confess myself and Toby,33
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts,33
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;,33
How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,33
If that the injuries be justly weigh'd,33
Alas poor fool how have they baffled thee!,33
and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was,33
that's all one. 'By the Lord fool I am not mad.',33
a barren rascal? an you smile not he's gagged:',33
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.,33
He hath been most notoriously abused.,33
He hath not told us of the captain yet:,33
A solemn combination shall be made,33
We will not part from hence. Cesario come;,33
But when in other habits you are seen,33
Exeunt all except Clown,33
When that I was and a little tiny boy,33
A foolish thing was but a toy,33
But when I came to man's estate,33
Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,33
But when I came alas! to wive,33
By swaggering could I never thrive,33
But when I came unto my beds,33
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,33
A great while ago the world begun,33
But that's all one our play is done,33
Exit,33
SCENE I. Verona. An open place.,34
Cease to persuade my loving Proteus:,34
Were't not affection chains thy tender days,34
I rather would entreat thy company,34
Than living dully sluggardized at home,34
But since thou lovest love still and thrive therein,34
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine adieu!,34
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:,34
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,34
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,34
And on a love-book pray for my success?,34
That's on some shallow story of deep love:,34
That's a deep story of a deeper love:,34
Tis true; for you are over boots in love,34
Over the boots? nay give me not the boots.,34
What?,34
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth,34
If haply won perhaps a hapless gain;,34
However but a folly bought with wit,34
So by your circumstance you call me fool.,34
Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.,34
And he that is so yoked by a fool,34
Yet writers say as in the sweetest bud,34
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.,34
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,34
Is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud,34
And all the fair effects of future hopes.,34
That art a votary to fond desire?,34
Expects my coming there to see me shipp'd.,34
Sweet Proteus no; now let us take our leave.,34
Of thy success in love and what news else,34
And likewise will visit thee with mine.,34
As much to you at home! and so farewell.,34
He after honour hunts I after love:,34
I leave myself my friends and all for love.,34
Made me neglect my studies lose my time,34
Made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought.,34
Sir Proteus save you! Saw you my master?,34
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,34
Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,34
You conclude that my master is a shepherd then,34
I do.,34
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.,34
True; and thy master a shepherd.,34
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.,34
shepherd; but I seek my master and my master seeks,34
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the,34
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages,34
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.',34
Ay sir: I a lost mutton gave your letter to her,34
lost mutton nothing for my labour.,34
If the ground be overcharged you were best stick her.,34
Nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for,34
You mistake; I mean the pound--a pinfold.,34
Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to,34
But what said she?,34
Nod--Ay--why that's noddy.,34
me if she did nod; and I say 'Ay.',34
Now you have taken the pains to set it together,34
No no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.,34
Why sir how do you bear with me?,34
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.,34
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.,34
Open your purse that the money and the matter may,34
Well sir here is for your pains. What said she?,34
Why couldst thou perceive so much from her?,34
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:,34
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your,34
hard as steel.,34
No not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To,34
me; in requital whereof henceforth carry your,34
Go go be gone to save your ship from wreck,34
Being destined to a drier death on shore.,34
I must go send some better messenger:,34
Receiving them from such a worthless post.,34
SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.,34
But say Lucetta now we are alone,34
Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully.,34
That every day with parle encounter me,34
Please you repeat their names I'll show my mind,34
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?,34
But were I you he never should be mine.,34
Well of his wealth; but of himself so so.,34
Lord Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!,34
Pardon dear madam: 'tis a passing shame,34
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.,34
Then thus: of many good I think him best.,34
I have no other but a woman's reason;,34
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?,34
Why he of all the rest hath never moved me.,34
His little speaking shows his love but small.,34
They do not love that do not show their love.,34
I would I knew his mind.,34
To Julia.' Say from whom?,34
Say say who gave it thee?,34
He would have given it you; but I being in the way,34
fault I pray.,34
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?,34
Now trust me 'tis an office of great worth,34
Or else return no more into my sight.,34
Will ye be gone?,34
Exit,34
It were a shame to call her back again,34
What a fool is she that knows I am a maid,34
Since maids in modesty say 'no' to that,34
Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love,34
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!,34
When willingly I would have had her here!,34
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!,34
And ask remission for my folly past.,34
Re-enter LUCETTA,34
Is't near dinner-time?,34
That you might kill your stomach on your meat,34
What is't that you took up so gingerly?,34
Why didst thou stoop then?,34
And is that paper nothing?,34
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.,34
Unless it have a false interpeter.,34
That I might sing it madam to a tune.,34
As little by such toys as may be possible.,34
It is too heavy for so light a tune.,34
Ay and melodious were it would you sing it.,34
I cannot reach so high.,34
Keep tune there still so you will sing it out:,34
You do not?,34
You minion are too saucy.,34
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:,34
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.,34
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.,34
Tears the letter,34
You would be fingering them to anger me.,34
To be so anger'd with another letter.,34
Nay would I were so anger'd with the same!,34
Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey,34
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.,34
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,34
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.,34
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed,34
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.,34
Be calm good wind blow not a word away,34
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear,34
And throw it thence into the raging sea!,34
Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus,34
And yet I will not sith so prettily,34
Thus will I fold them one on another:,34
Re-enter LUCETTA,34
Dinner is ready and your father stays.,34
What shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?,34
Nay I was taken up for laying them down:,34
I see you have a month's mind to them.,34
I see things too although you judge I wink.,34
Exeunt,34
Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO,34
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?,34
Why what of him?,34
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,34
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:,34
Some to discover islands far away;,34
For any or for all these exercises,34
And did request me to importune you,34
Which would be great impeachment to his age,34
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that,34
I have consider'd well his loss of time,34
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:,34
And perfected by the swift course of time.,34
I think your lordship is not ignorant,34
Attends the emperor in his royal court.,34
Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither:,34
Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen.,34
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.,34
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,34
Even with the speediest expedition,34
To-morrow may it please you Don Alphonso,34
Are journeying to salute the emperor,34
Good company; with them shall Proteus go:,34
Enter PROTEUS,34
Here is her hand the agent of her heart;,34
O that our fathers would applaud our loves,34
O heavenly Julia!,34
May't please your lordship 'tis a word or two,34
Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.,34
There is no news my lord but that he writes,34
And daily graced by the emperor;,34
And how stand you affected to his wish?,34
And not depending on his friendly wish.,34
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;,34
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time,34
What maintenance he from his friends receives,34
To-morrow be in readiness to go:,34
My lord I cannot be so soon provided:,34
Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:,34
Come on Panthino: you shall be employ'd,34
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO,34
And drench'd me in the sea where I am drown'd.,34
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;,34
Hath he excepted most against my love.,34
The uncertain glory of an April day,34
And by and by a cloud takes all away!,34
Sir Proteus your father calls for you:,34
Why this it is: my heart accords thereto,34
Exeunt,34
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.,34
Sir your glove.,34
Why then this may be yours for this is but one.,34
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!,34
Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!,34
She is not within hearing sir.,34
Your worship sir; or else I mistook.,34
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.,34
She that your worship loves?,34
Marry by these special marks: first you have,34
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song like a,34
the pestilence; to sigh like a school-boy that had,34
buried her grandam; to fast like one that takes,34
speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were,34
walked to walk like one of the lions; when you,34
looked sadly it was for want of money: and now you,34
on you I can hardly think you my master.,34
They are all perceived without ye.,34
Without you? nay that's certain for without you,34
without these follies that these follies are within,34
urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a,34
But tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia?,34
Hast thou observed that? even she I mean.,34
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet,34
Is she not hard-favoured sir?,34
Sir I know that well enough.,34
That she is not so fair as of you well-favoured.,34
That's because the one is painted and the other out,34
How painted? and how out of count?,34
man counts of her beauty.,34
You never saw her since she was deformed.,34
Ever since you loved her.,34
see her beautiful.,34
Why?,34
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to,34
ungartered!,34
Your own present folly and her passing deformity:,34
hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose.,34
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.,34
you swinged me for my love which makes me the,34
In conclusion I stand affected to her.,34
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to,34
And have you?,34
Are they not lamely writ?,34
here she comes.,34
Now will he interpret to her.,34
Madam and mistress a thousand good-morrows.,34
Sir Valentine and servant to you two thousand.,34
As you enjoin'd me I have writ your letter,34
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in,34
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.,34
For being ignorant to whom it goes,34
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?,34
Please you command a thousand times as much; And yet--,34
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;,34
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.,34
What means your ladyship? do you not like it?,34
But since unwillingly take them again.,34
Madam they are for you.,34
But I will none of them; they are for you;,34
Please you I'll write your ladyship another.,34
And if it please you so; if not why so.,34
Why if it please you take it for your labour:,34
Exit,34
As a nose on a man's face or a weathercock on a steeple!,34
taught her suitor,34
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,34
the letter?,34
Nay I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.,34
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.,34
To yourself: why she wooes you by a figure.,34
By a letter I should say.,34
What need she when she hath made you write to,34
No believe me.,34
her earnest?,34
Why she hath given you a letter.,34
And that letter hath she delivered and there an end.,34
I'll warrant you 'tis as well:,34
Or else for want of idle time could not again reply;,34
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.,34
Why muse you sir? 'tis dinner-time.,34
Ay but hearken sir; though the chameleon Love can,34
victuals and would fain have meat. O be not like,34
Exeunt,34
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA,34
I must where is no remedy.,34
If you turn not you will return the sooner.,34
Giving a ring,34
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.,34
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day,34
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance,34
My father stays my coming; answer not;,34
That tide will stay me longer than I should.,34
Exit JULIA,34
Ay so true love should do: it cannot speak;,34
Enter PANTHINO,34
Go; I come I come.,34
Exeunt,34
Enter LAUNCE leading a dog,34
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I,34
son and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's,34
dog that lives: my mother weeping my father,34
wringing her hands and all our house in a great,34
one tear: he is a stone a very pebble stone and,34
wept to have seen our parting; why my grandam,34
parting. Nay I'll show you the manner of it. This,34
no no this left shoe is my mother: nay that,34
hath the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in,34
on't! there 'tis: now sit this staff is my,34
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan our maid: I,34
dog--Oh! the dog is me and I am myself; ay so,34
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:,34
come I to my mother: O that she could speak now,34
tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now,34
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a,34
Enter PANTHINO,34
and thou art to post after with oars. What's the,34
lose the tide if you tarry any longer.,34
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.,34
Why he that's tied here Crab my dog.,34
losing the flood lose thy voyage and in losing,34
master lose thy service and in losing thy,34
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.,34
In thy tale.,34
Lose the tide and the voyage and the master and,34
were dry I am able to fill it with my tears; if the,34
Come come away man; I was sent to call thee.,34
Wilt thou go?,34
Exeunt,34
Enter SILVIA VALENTINE THURIO and SPEED,34
Mistress?,34
Ay boy it's for love.,34
Of my mistress then.,34
Exit,34
Indeed madam I seem so.,34
Haply I do.,34
So do you.,34
Wise.,34
Your folly.,34
I quote it in your jerkin.,34
Well then I'll double your folly.,34
What angry Sir Thurio! do you change colour?,34
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live,34
You have said sir.,34
I know it well sir; you always end ere you begin.,34
Tis indeed madam; we thank the giver.,34
Yourself sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir,34
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.,34
make your wit bankrupt.,34
and I think no other treasure to give your,34
that they live by your bare words.,34
Enter DUKE,34
Sir Valentine your father's in good health:,34
Of much good news?,34
To any happy messenger from thence.,34
Ay my good lord I know the gentleman,34
And not without desert so well reputed.,34
Ay my good lord; a son that well deserves,34
You know him well?,34
We have conversed and spent our hours together:,34
Omitting the sweet benefit of time,34
Yet hath Sir Proteus for that's his name,34
His years but young but his experience old;,34
And in a word for far behind his worth,34
He is complete in feature and in mind,34
Beshrew me sir but if he make this good,34
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.,34
With commendation from great potentates;,34
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.,34
Welcome him then according to his worth.,34
For Valentine I need not cite him to it:,34
Exit,34
Had come along with me but that his mistress,34
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them,34
Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still.,34
How could he see his way to seek out you?,34
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.,34
Upon a homely object Love can wink.,34
Exit THURIO,34
Welcome dear Proteus! Mistress I beseech you,34
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,34
Mistress it is: sweet lady entertain him,34
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.,34
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.,34
Sweet lady entertain him for your servant.,34
And duty never yet did want his meed:,34
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.,34
That you are worthless.,34
Madam my lord your father would speak with you.,34
Go with me. Once more new servant welcome:,34
When you have done we look to hear from you.,34
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO,34
Your friends are well and have them much commended.,34
I left them all in health.,34
My tales of love were wont to weary you;,34
Ay Proteus but that life is alter'd now:,34
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me,34
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;,34
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes,34
O gentle Proteus Love's a mighty lord,34
There is no woe to his correction,34
Now no discourse except it be of love;,34
Upon the very naked name of love.,34
Was this the idol that you worship so?,34
No; but she is an earthly paragon.,34
I will not flatter her.,34
When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,34
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,34
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.,34
Sweet except not any;,34
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?,34
She shall be dignified with this high honour--,34
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,34
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower,34
Why Valentine what braggardism is this?,34
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;,34
Then let her alone.,34
And I as rich in having such a jewel,34
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.,34
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.,34
Only for his possessions are so huge,34
For love thou know'st is full of jealousy.,34
Ay and we are betroth'd: nay more our,34
With all the cunning manner of our flight,34
The ladder made of cords and all the means,34
Good Proteus go with me to my chamber,34
Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:,34
Some necessaries that I needs must use,34
Will you make haste?,34
Exit VALENTINE,34
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,34
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.,34
Her true perfection or my false transgression,34
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--,34
Which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,34
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,34
O but I love his lady too too much,34
How shall I dote on her with more advice,34
Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,34
But when I look on her perfections,34
If I can cheque my erring love I will;,34
Exit,34
Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally,34
Forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not,34
undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a,34
say 'Welcome!',34
presently; where for one shot of five pence thou,34
did thy master part with Madam Julia?,34
fairly in jest.,34
No.,34
No neither.,34
No they are both as whole as a fish.,34
Marry thus: when it stands well with him it,34
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.,34
staff understands me.,34
Ay and what I do too: look thee I'll but lean,34
It stands under thee indeed.,34
But tell me true will't be a match?,34
it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing it will.,34
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.,34
thou that my master is become a notable lover?,34
Than how?,34
Why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me.,34
I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.,34
in love. If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse;,34
name of a Christian.,34
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to,34
At thy service.,34
SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.,34
To leave my Julia shall I be forsworn;,34
To wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn;,34
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;,34
O sweet-suggesting Love if thou hast sinned,34
At first I did adore a twinkling star,34
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,34
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.,34
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd,34
I cannot leave to love and yet I do;,34
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:,34
If I lose them thus find I by their loss,34
I to myself am dearer than a friend,34
And Silvia--witness Heaven that made her fair!--,34
I will forget that Julia is alive,34
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,34
I cannot now prove constant to myself,34
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder,34
Myself in counsel his competitor.,34
Of their disguising and pretended flight;,34
For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter;,34
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.,34
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!,34
SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.,34
Counsel Lucetta; gentle girl assist me;,34
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts,34
To lesson me and tell me some good mean,34
A journey to my loving Proteus.,34
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary,34
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,34
Of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus.,34
O know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?,34
By longing for that food so long a time.,34
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow,34
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,34
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.,34
The current that with gentle murmur glides,34
But when his fair course is not hindered,34
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge,34
And so by many winding nooks he strays,34
Then let me go and hinder not my course,34
And make a pastime of each weary step,34
And there I'll rest as after much turmoil,34
But in what habit will you go along?,34
The loose encounters of lascivious men:,34
As may beseem some well-reputed page.,34
No girl I'll knit it up in silken strings,34
To be fantastic may become a youth,34
What fashion madam shall I make your breeches?,34
What compass will you wear your farthingale?',34
You must needs have them with a codpiece madam.,34
A round hose madam now's not worth a pin,34
Lucetta as thou lovest me let me have,34
But tell me wench how will the world repute me,34
I fear me it will make me scandalized.,34
Nay that I will not.,34
If Proteus like your journey when you come,34
I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal.,34
A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears,34
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.,34
Base men that use them to so base effect!,34
His words are bonds his oaths are oracles,34
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,34
Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him!,34
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:,34
And presently go with me to my chamber,34
To furnish me upon my longing journey.,34
My goods my lands my reputation;,34
Come answer not but to it presently!,34
Exeunt,34
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.,34
Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile;,34
Exit THURIO,34
My gracious lord that which I would discover,34
But when I call to mind your gracious favours,34
My duty pricks me on to utter that,34
Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend,34
Myself am one made privy to the plot.,34
On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates;,34
It would be much vexation to your age.,34
To cross my friend in his intended drift,34
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,34
Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care;,34
This love of theirs myself have often seen,34
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid,34
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err,34
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,34
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.,34
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,34
The key whereof myself have ever kept;,34
Know noble lord they have devised a mean,34
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;,34
And this way comes he with it presently;,34
But good my Lord do it so cunningly,34
For love of you not hate unto my friend,34
Upon mine honour he shall never know,34
Adieu my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.,34
Enter VALENTINE,34
Please it your grace there is a messenger,34
And I am going to deliver them.,34
The tenor of them doth but signify,34
Nay then no matter; stay with me awhile;,34
That touch me near wherein thou must be secret.,34
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.,34
Were rich and honourable; besides the gentleman,34
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:,34
No trust me; she is peevish sullen froward,34
Neither regarding that she is my child,34
And may I say to thee this pride of hers,34
And where I thought the remnant of mine age,34
I now am full resolved to take a wife,34
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;,34
What would your Grace have me to do in this?,34
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy,34
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--,34
Besides the fashion of the time is changed--,34
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.,34
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind,34
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.,34
Send her another; never give her o'er;,34
If she do frown 'tis not in hate of you,34
If she do chide 'tis not to have you gone;,34
Take no repulse whatever she doth say;,34
Flatter and praise commend extol their graces;,34
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man,34
But she I mean is promised by her friends,34
And kept severely from resort of men,34
Why then I would resort to her by night.,34
That no man hath recourse to her by night.,34
Her chamber is aloft far from the ground,34
Without apparent hazard of his life.,34
To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks,34
So bold Leander would adventure it.,34
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.,34
This very night; for Love is like a child,34
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.,34
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?,34
Under a cloak that is of any length.,34
Ay my good lord.,34
I'll get me one of such another length.,34
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?,34
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!,34
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.,34
My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,34
O could their master come and go as lightly,34
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:,34
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,34
I curse myself for they are sent by me,34
What's here?,34
Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.,34
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,34
Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?,34
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,34
Is privilege for thy departure hence:,34
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.,34
Longer than swiftest expedition,34
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love,34
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;,34
Exit,34
To die is to be banish'd from myself;,34
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!,34
What joy is joy if Silvia be not by?,34
And feed upon the shadow of perfection,34
There is no music in the nightingale;,34
There is no day for me to look upon;,34
If I be not by her fair influence,34
I fly not death to fly his deadly doom:,34
But fly I hence I fly away from life.,34
Run boy run run and seek him out.,34
What seest thou?,34
but 'tis a Valentine.,34
No.,34
Neither.,34
Nothing.,34
Who wouldst thou strike?,34
Villain forbear.,34
Sirrah I say forbear. Friend Valentine a word.,34
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.,34
For they are harsh untuneable and bad.,34
No Valentine.,34
Hath she forsworn me?,34
No Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me.,34
Sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished.,34
From hence from Silvia and from me thy friend.,34
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.,34
Ay ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--,34
A sea of melting pearl which some call tears:,34
With them upon her knees her humble self;,34
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:,34
Sad sighs deep groans nor silver-shedding tears,34
But Valentine if he be ta'en must die.,34
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,34
With many bitter threats of biding there.,34
Have some malignant power upon my life:,34
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.,34
And study help for that which thou lament'st.,34
Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love;,34
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that,34
Thy letters may be here though thou art hence;,34
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.,34
Come I'll convey thee through the city-gate;,34
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.,34
Regard thy danger and along with me!,34
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.,34
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!,34
I am but a fool look you; and yet I have the wit to,34
all one if he be but one knave. He lives not now,34
team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who,34
will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet,34
a maid for she is her master's maid and serves for,34
which is much in a bare Christian.,34
Here is the cate-log of her condition.,34
can do no more: nay a horse cannot fetch but only,34
She can milk;' look you a sweet virtue in a maid,34
Enter SPEED,34
mastership?,34
Well your old vice still; mistake the word. What,34
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.,34
Why as black as ink.,34
Fie on thee jolt-head! thou canst not read.,34
I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?,34
O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy,34
Come fool come; try me in thy paper.,34
[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.',34
Item: She brews good ale.',34
heart you brew good ale.',34
That's as much as to say Can she so?,34
What need a man care for a stock with a wench when,34
Item: She can wash and scour.',34
and scoured.,34
Then may I set the world on wheels when she can,34
Item: She hath many nameless virtues.',34
indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names.,34
Close at the heels of her virtues.,34
of her breath.',34
Item: She hath a sweet mouth.',34
Item: She doth talk in her sleep.',34
Item: She is slow in words.',34
be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray,34
Item: She is proud.',34
be ta'en from her.,34
I care not for that neither because I love crusts.,34
Well the best is she hath no teeth to bite.,34
If her liquor be good she shall: if she will not I,34
Item: She is too liberal.',34
is slow of; of her purse she shall not for that,34
that cannot I help. Well proceed.,34
than hairs and more wealth than faults.',34
mine twice or thrice in that last article.,34
Item: She hath more hair than wit'--,34
cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it,34
is more than the wit for the greater hides the,34
And more faults than hairs'--,34
And more wealth than faults.',34
I'll have her; and if it be a match as nothing is,34
What then?,34
for thee at the North-gate.,34
For thee! ay who art thou? he hath stayed for a,34
And must I go to him?,34
that going will scarce serve the turn.,34
Exit,34
unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into,34
Exit,34
Enter DUKE and THURIO,34
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.,34
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,34
This weak impress of love is as a figure,34
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.,34
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.,34
How now Sir Proteus! Is your countryman,34
Gone my good lord.,34
A little time my lord will kill that grief.,34
Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee--,34
Makes me the better to confer with thee.,34
Let me not live to look upon your grace.,34
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.,34
And also I think thou art not ignorant,34
She did my lord when Valentine was here.,34
What might we do to make the girl forget,34
The best way is to slander Valentine,34
Three things that women highly hold in hate.,34
Ay if his enemy deliver it:,34
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.,34
And that my lord I shall be loath to do:,34
Especially against his very friend.,34
Your slander never can endamage him;,34
Being entreated to it by your friend.,34
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,34
But say this weed her love from Valentine,34
Therefore as you unwind her love from him,34
You must provide to bottom it on me;,34
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.,34
Because we know on Valentine's report,34
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.,34
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;,34
And for your friend's sake will be glad of you;,34
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.,34
But you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough;,34
By wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes,34
Ay,34
Say that upon the altar of her beauty,34
Write till your ink be dry and with your tears,34
That may discover such integrity:,34
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,34
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.,34
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window,34
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence,34
This or else nothing will inherit her.,34
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.,34
Let us into the city presently,34
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn,34
About it gentlemen!,34
And afterward determine our proceedings.,34
Exeunt,34
SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.,34
Fellows stand fast; I see a passenger.,34
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED,34
If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.,34
That all the travellers do fear so much.,34
That's not so sir: we are your enemies.,34
Ay by my beard will we for he's a proper man.,34
A man I am cross'd with adversity;,34
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,34
Whither travel you?,34
Whence came you?,34
Have you long sojourned there?,34
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.,34
I was.,34
For that which now torments me to rehearse:,34
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,34
Why ne'er repent it if it were done so.,34
I was and held me glad of such a doom.,34
My youthful travel therein made me happy,34
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,34
We'll have him. Sirs a word.,34
Peace villain!,34
Nothing but my fortune.,34
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth,34
Myself was from Verona banished,34
An heir and near allied unto the duke.,34
Who in my mood I stabb'd unto the heart.,34
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,34
And partly seeing you are beautified,34
A linguist and a man of such perfection,34
Indeed because you are a banish'd man,34
Are you content to be our general?,34
And live as we do in this wilderness?,34
Say ay and be the captain of us all:,34
Love thee as our commander and our king.,34
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.,34
Provided that you do no outrages,34
No we detest such vile base practises.,34
And show thee all the treasure we have got,34
Exeunt,34
Enter PROTEUS,34
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.,34
I have access my own love to prefer:,34
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.,34
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;,34
She bids me think how I have been forsworn,34
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,34
Yet spaniel-like the more she spurns my love,34
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,34
Enter THURIO and Musicians,34
Ay gentle Thurio: for you know that love,34
Ay but I hope sir that you love not here.,34
Who? Silvia?,34
I thank you for your own. Now gentlemen,34
Enter at a distance Host and JULIA in boy's clothes,34
pray you why is it?,34
Come we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where,34
But shall I hear him speak?,34
That will be music.,34
Hark hark!,34
Ay: but peace! let's hear 'em.,34
Who is Silvia? what is she,34
Holy fair and wise is she;,34
That she might admired be.,34
For beauty lives with kindness.,34
To help him of his blindness,34
Then to Silvia let us sing,34
She excels each mortal thing,34
To her let us garlands bring.,34
do you man? the music likes you not.,34
Why my pretty youth?,34
How? out of tune on the strings?,34
heart-strings.,34
Ay I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.,34
Not a whit when it jars so.,34
Ay that change is the spite.,34
I would always have one play but one thing.,34
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?,34
her out of all nick.,34
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow by his,34
Peace! stand aside: the company parts.,34
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.,34
At Saint Gregory's well.,34
Exeunt THURIO and Musicians,34
Madam good even to your ladyship.,34
Who is that that spake?,34
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.,34
Sir Proteus gentle lady and your servant.,34
That I may compass yours.,34
That presently you hie you home to bed.,34
Think'st thou I am so shallow so conceitless,34
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?,34
For me by this pale queen of night I swear,34
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,34
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.,34
But she is dead.,34
For I am sure she is not buried.,34
Survives; to whom thyself art witness,34
To wrong him with thy importunacy?,34
And so suppose am I; for in his grave,34
Sweet lady let me rake it from the earth.,34
Or at the least in hers sepulchre thine.,34
Madam if your heart be so obdurate,34
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;,34
For since the substance of your perfect self,34
And to your shadow will I make true love.,34
deceive it,34
I am very loath to be your idol sir;,34
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,34
And so good rest.,34
That wait for execution in the morn.,34
Host will you go?,34
Pray you where lies Sir Proteus?,34
day.,34
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.,34
SCENE III. The same.,34
This is the hour that Madam Silvia,34
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.,34
Enter SILVIA above,34
Your servant and your friend;,34
Sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow.,34
According to your ladyship's impose,34
It is your pleasure to command me in.,34
Think not I flatter for I swear I do not--,34
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will,34
Nor how my father would enforce me marry,34
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say,34
As when thy lady and thy true love died,34
Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine,34
And for the ways are dangerous to pass,34
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.,34
But think upon my grief a lady's grief,34
To keep me from a most unholy match,34
I do desire thee even from a heart,34
To bear me company and go with me:,34
That I may venture to depart alone.,34
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,34
Recking as little what betideth me,34
When will you go?,34
Where shall I meet you?,34
Where I intend holy confession.,34
Good morrow kind Sir Eglamour.,34
SCENE IV. The same.,34
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,34
puppy; one that I saved from drowning when three or,34
I have taught him even as one would say precisely,34
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;,34
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:,34
in all companies! I would have as one should say,34
as it were a dog at all things. If I had not had,34
I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I,34
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four,34
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while but,34
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him,34
I having been acquainted with the smell before,34
whips the dogs: 'Friend' quoth I 'you mean to whip,34
the more wrong' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you,34
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for,34
stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had,34
he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for't.,34
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam,34
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make,34
thou ever see me do such a trick?,34
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,34
In what you please: I'll do what I can.,34
To LAUNCE,34
Where have you been these two days loitering?,34
And what says she to my little jewel?,34
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.,34
No indeed did she not: here have I brought him,34
What didst thou offer her this from me?,34
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I,34
yours and therefore the gift the greater.,34
Or ne'er return again into my sight.,34
Exit LAUNCE,34
Sebastian I have entertained thee,34
That can with some discretion do my business,34
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,34
Witness good bringing up fortune and truth:,34
Go presently and take this ring with thee,34
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.,34
She is dead belike?,34
Alas!,34
I cannot choose,34
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?,34
As you do love your lady Silvia:,34
You dote on her that cares not for your love.,34
And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!',34
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady,34
Your message done hie home unto my chamber,34
Exit,34
Alas poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd,34
Alas poor fool! why do I pity him,34
Because he loves her he despiseth me;,34
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,34
And now am I unhappy messenger,34
To carry that which I would have refused,34
I am my master's true-confirmed love;,34
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.,34
As heaven it knows I would not have him speed.,34
Gentlewoman good day! I pray you be my mean,34
What would you with her if that I be she?,34
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.,34
From my master Sir Proteus madam.,34
Ay madam.,34
Go give your master this: tell him from me,34
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.,34
Pardon me madam; I have unadvised,34
This is the letter to your ladyship.,34
It may not be; good madam pardon me.,34
I will not look upon your master's lines:,34
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break,34
Madam he sends your ladyship this ring.,34
For I have heard him say a thousand times,34
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,34
She thanks you.,34
I thank you madam that you tender her.,34
Dost thou know her?,34
To think upon her woes I do protest,34
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.,34
Is she not passing fair?,34
When she did think my master loved her well,34
But since she did neglect her looking-glass,34
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks,34
That now she is become as black as I.,34
About my stature; for at Pentecost,34
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,34
Which served me as fit by all men's judgments,34
Therefore I know she is about my height.,34
For I did play a lamentable part:,34
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;,34
That my poor mistress moved therewithal,34
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!,34
Alas poor lady desolate and left!,34
Here youth there is my purse; I give thee this,34
Farewell.,34
And she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her.,34
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,34
Alas how love can trifle with itself!,34
If I had such a tire this face of mine,34
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,34
Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow:,34
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.,34
Ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high.,34
But I can make respective in myself,34
Come shadow come and take this shadow up,34
Thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd loved and adored!,34
My substance should be statue in thy stead.,34
That used me so; or else by Jove I vow,34
To make my master out of love with thee!,34
ACT V,34
Enter EGLAMOUR,34
And now it is about the very hour,34
She will not fail for lovers break not hours,34
So much they spur their expedition.,34
Enter SILVIA,34
Amen amen! Go on good Eglamour,34
I fear I am attended by some spies.,34
If we recover that we are sure enough.,34
SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.,34
Sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suit?,34
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.,34
No; that it is too little.,34
[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what,34
What says she to my face?,34
Nay then the wanton lies; my face is black.,34
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.,34
ladies' eyes;,34
How likes she my discourse?,34
But well when I discourse of love and peace?,34
What says she to my valour?,34
[Aside]  She needs not when she knows it cowardice.,34
That you are well derived.,34
Considers she my possessions?,34
Wherefore?,34
That they are out by lease.,34
Enter DUKE,34
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?,34
Nor I.,34
Neither.,34
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;,34
Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,34
Him he knew well and guess'd that it was she,34
Besides she did intend confession,34
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.,34
But mount you presently and meet with me,34
That leads towards Mantua whither they are fled:,34
Exit,34
That flies her fortune when it follows her.,34
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.,34
And I will follow more for Silvia's love,34
Exit,34
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.,34
SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.,34
Come come,34
A thousand more mischances than this one,34
Come bring her away.,34
Being nimble-footed he hath outrun us,34
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;,34
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.,34
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,34
O Valentine this I endure for thee!,34
SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.,34
How use doth breed a habit in a man!,34
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:,34
And to the nightingale's complaining notes,34
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,34
Lest growing ruinous the building fall,34
Repair me with thy presence Silvia;,34
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?,34
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.,34
To keep them from uncivil outrages.,34
Enter PROTEUS SILVIA and JULIA,34
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,34
That would have forced your honour and your love;,34
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,34
[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!,34
O miserable unhappy that I am!,34
But by my coming I have made you happy.,34
[Aside]  And me when he approacheth to your presence.,34
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,34
O Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,34
And full as much for more there cannot be,34
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.,34
Would I not undergo for one calm look!,34
When women cannot love where they're beloved!,34
Read over Julia's heart thy first best love,34
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths,34
Thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two;,34
Than plural faith which is too much by one:,34
In love,34
All men but Proteus.,34
Can no way change you to a milder form,34
And love you 'gainst the nature of love--force ye.,34
I'll force thee yield to my desire.,34
Thou friend of an ill fashion!,34
Thou common friend that's without faith or love,34
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye,34
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.,34
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,34
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.,34
Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!,34
Forgive me Valentine: if hearty sorrow,34
I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer,34
Then I am paid;,34
Who by repentance is not satisfied,34
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:,34
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.,34
Swoons,34
Why boy! why wag! how now! what's the matter?,34
O good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring,34
Where is that ring boy?,34
How! let me see:,34
O cry you mercy sir I have mistook:,34
But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart,34
And Julia herself did give it me;,34
How! Julia!,34
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.,34
O Proteus let this habit make thee blush!,34
Such an immodest raiment if shame live,34
It is the lesser blot modesty finds,34
Than men their minds! 'tis true.,34
But constant he were perfect. That one error,34
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.,34
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?,34
Let me be blest to make this happy close;,34
Bear witness Heaven I have my wish for ever.,34
Enter Outlaws with DUKE and THURIO,34
Forbear forbear I say! it is my lord the duke.,34
Banished Valentine.,34
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.,34
Come not within the measure of my wrath;,34
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;,34
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.,34
I hold him but a fool that will endanger,34
I claim her not and therefore she is thine.,34
To make such means for her as thou hast done,34
Now by the honour of my ancestry,34
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:,34
Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again,34
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,34
Take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserved her.,34
I now beseech you for your daughter's sake,34
I grant it for thine own whate'er it be.,34
Are men endued with worthy qualities:,34
And let them be recall'd from their exile:,34
And fit for great employment worthy lord.,34
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.,34
With triumphs mirth and rare solemnity.,34
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.,34
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.,34
What mean you by that saying?,34
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.,34
The story of your loves discovered:,34
One feast one house one mutual happiness.,34
ACT I,35
Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS,35
the like occasion whereon my services are now on,35
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.,35
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.,35
justified in our loves; for indeed--,35
Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:,35
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,35
may though they cannot praise us as little accuse,35
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.,35
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.,35
They were trained together in their childhoods; and,35
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their,35
separation of their society their encounters,35
with interchange of gifts letters loving,35
though absent shook hands as over a vast and,35
winds. The heavens continue their loves!,35
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable,35
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came,35
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it,35
subject makes old hearts fresh: they that went on,35
see him a man.,35
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should,35
If the king had no son they would desire to live,35
Exeunt,35
Enter LEONTES HERMIONE MAMILLIUS POLIXENES CAMILLO and Attendants,35
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne,35
Would be find up my brother with our thanks;,35
Go hence in debt: and therefore like a cipher,35
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe,35
Stay your thanks a while;,35
Sir that's to-morrow.,35
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow,35
This is put forth too truly:' besides I have stay'd,35
We are tougher brother,35
No longer stay.,35
Very sooth to-morrow.,35
I'll no gainsaying.,35
There is no tongue that moves none none i' the world,35
Were there necessity in your request although,35
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder,35
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,35
Tongue-tied our queen?,35
I had thought sir to have held my peace until,35
Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure,35
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,35
Well said Hermione.,35
But let him say so then and let him go;,35
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.,35
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia,35
To let him there a month behind the gest,35
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind,35
No madam.,35
I may not verily.,35
You put me off with limber vows; but I,35
stars with oaths,35
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's,35
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,35
When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?,35
One of them you shall be.,35
To be your prisoner should import offending;,35
Than you to punish.,35
But your kind hostess. Come I'll question you,35
You were pretty lordings then?,35
Two lads that thought there was no more behind,35
And to be boy eternal.,35
The verier wag o' the two?,35
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed,35
The doctrine of ill-doing nor dream'd,35
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd,35
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd,35
By this we gather,35
O my most sacred lady!,35
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;,35
Of my young play-fellow.,35
Of this make no conclusion lest you say,35
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,35
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not,35
Is he won yet?,35
At my request he would not.,35
To better purpose.,35
Never but once.,35
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise and make's,35
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.,35
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere,35
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:,35
Or I mistake you: O would her name were Grace!,35
Nay let me have't; I long.,35
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,35
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter,35
Tis grace indeed.,35
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;,35
[Aside] Too hot too hot!,35
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;,35
May a free face put on derive a liberty,35
And well become the agent; 't may I grant;,35
As now they are and making practised smiles,35
The mort o' the deer; O that is entertainment,35
Art thou my boy?,35
I' fecks!,35
smutch'd thy nose?,35
We must be neat; not neat but cleanly captain:,35
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling,35
Art thou my calf?,35
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,35
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,35
As o'er-dyed blacks as wind as waters false,35
No bourn 'twixt his and mine yet were it true,35
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!,35
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:,35
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--,35
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent,35
And that beyond commission and I find it,35
And hardening of my brows.,35
He something seems unsettled.,35
What cheer? how is't with you best brother?,35
Are you moved my lord?,35
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,35
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines,35
Twenty-three years and saw myself unbreech'd,35
Lest it should bite its master and so prove,35
How like methought I then was to this kernel,35
Will you take eggs for money?,35
You will! why happy man be's dole! My brother,35
Do seem to be of ours?,35
He's all my exercise my mirth my matter,35
My parasite my soldier statesman all:,35
And with his varying childness cures in me,35
So stands this squire,35
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,35
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:,35
Apparent to my heart.,35
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?,35
Be you beneath the sky.,35
I am angling now,35
Go to go to!,35
And arms her with the boldness of a wife,35
Exeunt POLIXENES HERMIONE and Attendants,35
Inch-thick knee-deep o'er head and,35
Go play boy play: thy mother plays and I,35
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour,35
There have been,35
And many a man there is even at this present,35
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence,35
Sir Smile his neighbour: nay there's comfort in't,35
As mine against their will. Should all despair,35
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;,35
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful think it,35
No barricado for a belly; know't;,35
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's,35
I am like you they say.,35
Ay my good lord.,35
Exit MAMILLIUS,35
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:,35
Didst note it?,35
His business more material.,35
Aside,35
Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,35
That he did stay?,35
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent,35
By any understanding pate but thine?,35
More than the common blocks: not noted is't,35
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes,35
Business my lord! I think most understand,35
Ha!,35
Ay but why?,35
Of our most gracious mistress.,35
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!,35
With all the nearest things to my heart as well,35
Hast cleansed my bosom I from thee departed,35
Deceived in thy integrity deceived,35
Be it forbid my lord!,35
If thou inclinest that way thou art a coward,35
From course required; or else thou must be counted,35
And therein negligent; or else a fool,35
And takest it all for jest.,35
I may be negligent foolish and fearful;,35
But that his negligence his folly fear,35
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs my lord,35
It was my folly; if industriously,35
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful,35
Where of the execution did cry out,35
Which oft infects the wisest: these my lord,35
Is never free of. But beseech your grace,35
By its own visage: if I then deny it,35
Ha' not you seen Camillo--,35
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn--or heard--,35
Cannot be mute--or thought--for cogitation,35
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,35
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say,35
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to,35
I would not be a stander-by to hear,35
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,35
Than this; which to reiterate were sin,35
Is whispering nothing?,35
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career,35
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?,35
Hours minutes? noon midnight? and all eyes,35
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?,35
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;,35
If this be nothing.,35
Of this diseased opinion and betimes;,35
Say it be 'tis true.,35
It is; you lie you lie:,35
Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave,35
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,35
Infected as her life she would not live,35
Who does infect her?,35
About his neck Bohemia: who if I,35
To see alike mine honour as their profits,35
Which should undo more doing: ay and thou,35
Have benched and reared to worship who mayst see,35
How I am galled--mightst bespice a cup,35
Which draught to me were cordial.,35
I could do this and that with no rash potion,35
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot,35
So sovereignly being honourable.,35
Make that thy question and go rot!,35
To appoint myself in this vexation sully,35
Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted,35
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,35
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?,35
I must believe you sir:,35
Provided that when he's removed your highness,35
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing,35
Known and allied to yours.,35
Even so as I mine own course have set down:,35
My lord,35
As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia,35
If from me he have wholesome beverage,35
This is all:,35
Do't not thou split'st thine own.,35
I will seem friendly as thou hast advised me.,35
O miserable lady! But for me,35
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't,35
Who in rebellion with himself will have,35
Promotion follows. If I could find example,35
And flourish'd after I'ld not do't; but since,35
Let villany itself forswear't. I must,35
To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!,35
Re-enter POLIXENES,35
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?,35
Hail most royal sir!,35
None rare my lord.,35
As he had lost some province and a region,35
With customary compliment; when he,35
A lip of much contempt speeds from me and,35
That changeth thus his manners.,35
How! dare not! do not. Do you know and dare not?,35
For to yourself what you do know you must.,35
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror,35
A party in this alteration finding,35
There is a sickness,35
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught,35
How! caught of me!,35
I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better,35
As you are certainly a gentleman thereto,35
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,35
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge,35
In ignorant concealment.,35
A sickness caught of me and yet I well!,35
I conjure thee by all the parts of man,35
Is not this suit of mine that thou declare,35
Is creeping toward me; how far off how near;,35
If not how best to bear it.,35
Since I am charged in honour and by him,35
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as,35
Cry lost and so good night!,35
I am appointed him to murder you.,35
By the king.,35
He thinks nay with all confidence he swears,35
To vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen,35
O then my best blood turn,35
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!,35
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril,35
Nay hated too worse than the great'st infection,35
Swear his thought over,35
By all their influences you may as well,35
As or by oath remove or counsel shake,35
Is piled upon his faith and will continue,35
How should this grow?,35
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.,35
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you,35
Your followers I will whisper to the business,35
Clear them o' the city. For myself I'll put,35
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;,35
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,35
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon,35
I do believe thee:,35
Be pilot to me and thy places shall,35
My people did expect my hence departure,35
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,35
Must it be violent and as he does conceive,35
Profess'd to him why his revenges must,35
Good expedition be my friend and comfort,35
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come Camillo;,35
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.,35
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness,35
Exeunt,35
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.,35
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,35
Come my gracious lord,35
No I'll none of you.,35
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if,35
And why so my lord?,35
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows they say,35
Too much hair there but in a semicircle,35
Who taught you this?,35
What colour are your eyebrows?,35
Nay that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose,35
Hark ye;,35
Present our services to a fine new prince,35
If we would have you.,35
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!,35
I am for you again: pray you sit by us,35
Merry or sad shall't be?,35
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one,35
Let's have that good sir.,35
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.,35
Nay come sit down; then on.,35
Yond crickets shall not hear it.,35
And give't me in mine ear.,35
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?,35
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them,35
How blest am I,35
Alack for lesser knowledge! how accursed,35
A spider steep'd and one may drink depart,35
Is not infected: but if one present,35
How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides,35
and seen the spider.,35
There is a plot against my life my crown;,35
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:,35
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea a very trick,35
So easily open?,35
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so,35
I know't too well.,35
Though he does bear some signs of me yet you,35
What is this? sport?,35
Away with him! and let her sport herself,35
Has made thee swell thus.,35
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,35
You my lords,35
To say 'she is a goodly lady' and,35
Tis pity she's not honest honourable:',35
Which on my faith deserves high speech and straight,35
That calumny doth use--O I am out--,35
Virtue itself: these shrugs these hums and ha's,35
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,35
She's an adulteress.,35
The most replenish'd villain in the world,35
Do but mistake.,35
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!,35
Lest barbarism making me the precedent,35
And mannerly distinguishment leave out,35
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:,35
A federary with her and one that knows,35
But with her most vile principal that she's,35
That vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy,35
No by my life.,35
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that,35
You scarce can right me throughly then to say,35
No; if I mistake,35
The centre is not big enough to bear,35
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty,35
There's some ill planet reigns:,35
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,35
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew,35
That honourable grief lodged here which burns,35
With thoughts so qualified as your charities,35
The king's will be perform'd!,35
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,35
My plight requires it. Do not weep good fools;,35
Has deserved prison then abound in tears,35
Is for my better grace. Adieu my lord:,35
I trust I shall. My women come; you have leave.,35
Exit HERMIONE guarded; with Ladies,35
Be certain what you do sir lest your justice,35
Yourself your queen your son.,35
I dare my life lay down and will do't sir,35
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,35
If it prove,35
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;,35
For every inch of woman in the world,35
Hold your peaces.,35
It is for you we speak not for ourselves:,35
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,35
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven,35
If this prove true they'll pay for't:,35
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,35
And I had rather glib myself than they,35
Cease; no more.,35
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't,35
The instruments that feel.,35
We need no grave to bury honesty:,35
Of the whole dungy earth.,35
I had rather you did lack than I my lord,35
To have her honour true than your suspicion,35
Why what need we,35
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative,35
Imparts this; which if you or stupefied,35
Relish a truth like us inform yourselves,35
The loss the gain the ordering on't is all,35
And I wish my liege,35
Without more overture.,35
Either thou art most ignorant by age,35
Added to their familiarity,35
That lack'd sight only nought for approbation,35
Made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding:,35
For in an act of this importance 'twere,35
To sacred Delphos to Apollo's temple,35
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle,35
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?,35
Though I am satisfied and need no more,35
Give rest to the minds of others such as he,35
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good,35
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence,35
We are to speak in public; for this business,35
[Aside],35
If the good truth were known.,35
SCENE II. A prison.,35
The keeper of the prison call to him;,35
Exit Gentleman,35
No court in Europe is too good for thee;,35
Re-enter Gentleman with the Gaoler,35
You know me do you not?,35
And one whom much I honour.,35
Conduct me to the queen.,35
To the contrary I have express commandment.,35
To lock up honesty and honour from,35
Is't lawful pray you,35
So please you madam,35
Shall bring Emilia forth.,35
Withdraw yourselves.,35
And madam,35
Well be't so prithee.,35
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain,35
Re-enter Gaoler with EMILIA,35
How fares our gracious lady?,35
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,35
She is something before her time deliver'd.,35
A daughter and a goodly babe,35
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,35
I dare be sworn,35
beshrew them!,35
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:,35
And never to my red-look'd anger be,35
Commend my best obedience to the queen:,35
I'll show't the king and undertake to be,35
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:,35
Persuades when speaking fails.,35
Your honour and your goodness is so evident,35
A thriving issue: there is no lady living,35
To visit the next room I'll presently,35
Who  but to-day hammer'd of this design,35
Lest she should be denied.,35
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't,35
I shall do good.,35
I'll to the queen: please you,35
Madam if't please the queen to send the babe,35
Having no warrant.,35
This child was prisoner to the womb and is,35
Freed and enfranchised not a party to,35
If any be the trespass of the queen.,35
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,35
Exeunt,35
Enter LEONTES ANTIGONUS Lords and Servants,35
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If,35
She the adulteress; for the harlot king,35
And level of my brain plot-proof; but she,35
Given to the fire a moiety of my rest,35
My lord?,35
He took good rest to-night;,35
To see his nobleness!,35
He straight declined droop'd took it deeply,35
Threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep,35
See how he fares.,35
Fie fie! no thought of him:,35
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,35
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,35
Laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow:,35
Shall she within my power.,35
You must not enter.,35
Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas,35
More free than he is jealous.,35
Madam he hath not slept tonight; commanded,35
Not so hot good sir:,35
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh,35
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I,35
Honest as either to purge him of that humour,35
What noise there ho?,35
About some gossips for your highness.,35
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,35
I knew she would.,35
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,35
What canst not rule her?,35
Unless he take the course that you have done,35
He shall not rule me.,35
When she will take the rein I let her run;,35
Good my liege I come;,35
Myself your loyal servant your physician,35
Less appear so in comforting your evils,35
From your good queen.,35
Good queen my lord,35
And would by combat make her good so were I,35
Force her hence.,35
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;,35
For she is good hath brought you forth a daughter;,35
Laying down the child,35
A mankind witch! Hence with her out o' door:,35
Not so:,35
In so entitling me and no less honest,35
As this world goes to pass for honest.,35
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.,35
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;,35
For ever,35
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness,35
He dreads his wife.,35
You'ld call your children yours.,35
I am none by this good light.,35
But one that's here and that's himself for he,35
His hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander,35
and will not--,35
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove,35
As ever oak or stone was sound.,35
Of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband,35
It is the issue of Polixenes:,35
Commit them to the fire!,35
And might we lay the old proverb to your charge,35
Although the print be little the whole matter,35
The trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley,35
His smiles,35
And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it,35
The ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colours,35
Her children not her husband's!,35
And lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd,35
Hang all the husbands,35
Hardly one subject.,35
A most unworthy and unnatural lord,35
I'll ha' thee burnt.,35
It is an heretic that makes the fire,35
But this most cruel usage of your queen,35
Than your own weak-hinged fancy something savours,35
Yea scandalous to the world.,35
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,35
If she did know me one. Away with her!,35
Look to your babe my lord; 'tis yours:,35
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?,35
Will never do him good not one of you.,35
Exit,35
My child? away with't! Even thou that hast,35
And see it instantly consumed with fire;,35
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,35
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse,35
The bastard brains with these my proper hands,35
For thou set'st on thy wife.,35
These lords my noble fellows if they please,35
We can: my royal liege,35
You're liars all.,35
We have always truly served you and beseech you,35
As recompense of our dear services,35
Which being so horrible so bloody must,35
I am a feather for each wind that blows:,35
And call me father? better burn it now,35
It shall not neither. You sir come you hither;,35
With Lady Margery your midwife there,35
So sure as this beard's grey,35
To save this brat's life?,35
That my ability may undergo,35
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left,35
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword,35
I will my lord.,35
Of any point in't shall not only be,35
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,35
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it,35
Of our dominions and that there thou leave it,35
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune,35
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,35
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.,35
Had been more merciful. Come on poor babe:,35
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears they say,35
Like offices of pity. Sir be prosperous,35
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,35
Exit with the child,35
Another's issue.,35
Please your highness posts,35
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,35
Hasting to the court.,35
Hath been beyond account.,35
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells,35
The truth of this appear. Prepare you lords;,35
Our most disloyal lady for as she hath,35
A just and open trial. While she lives,35
And think upon my bidding.,35
ACT III,35
Enter CLEOMENES and DION,35
Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing,35
I shall report,35
Methinks I so should term them and the reverence,35
How ceremonious solemn and unearthly,35
But of all the burst,35
Kin to Jove's thunder so surprised my sense.,35
If the event o' the journey,35
As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy,35
Great Apollo,35
So forcing faults upon Hermione,35
The violent carriage of it,35
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,35
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!,35
Exeunt,35
Enter LEONTES Lords and Officers,35
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried,35
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd,35
Proceed in justice which shall have due course,35
Produce the prisoner.,35
Appear in person here in court. Silence!,35
Read the indictment.,35
Leontes king of Sicilia thou art here accused and,35
with Polixenes king of Bohemia and conspiring,35
lord the king thy royal husband: the pretence,35
thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance,35
their better safety to fly away by night.,35
Which contradicts my accusation and,35
But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me,35
Being counted falsehood shall as I express it,35
Behold our human actions as they do,35
False accusation blush and tyranny,35
Who least will seem to do so my past life,35
As I am now unhappy; which is more,35
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me,35
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,35
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore,35
As I weigh grief which I would spare: for honour,35
And only that I stand for. I appeal,35
Came to your court how I was in your grace,35
With what encounter so uncurrent I,35
The bound of honour or in act or will,35
Of all that hear me and my near'st of kin,35
I ne'er heard yet,35
Less impudence to gainsay what they did,35
That's true enough;,35
You will not own it.,35
Which comes to me in name of fault I must not,35
With whom I am accused I do confess,35
With such a kind of love as might become,35
So and no other as yourself commanded:,35
Both disobedience and ingratitude,35
Even since it could speak from an infant freely,35
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd,35
Is that Camillo was an honest man;,35
Wotting no more than I are ignorant.,35
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.,35
You speak a language that I understand not:,35
Which I'll lay down.,35
You had a bastard by Polixenes,35
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:,35
Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself,35
More criminal in thee than it--so thou,35
Look for no less than death.,35
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.,35
The crown and comfort of my life your favour,35
But know not how it went. My second joy,35
I am barr'd like one infectious. My third comfort,35
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,35
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred,35
To women of all fashion; lastly hurried,35
I have got strength of limit. Now my liege,35
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.,35
I prize it not a straw but for mine honour,35
Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else,35
Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,35
Apollo be my judge!,35
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,35
Exeunt certain Officers,35
O that he were alive and here beholding,35
The flatness of my misery yet with eyes,35
Re-enter Officers with CLEOMENES and DION,35
That you Cleomenes and Dion have,35
The seal'd-up oracle by the hand deliver'd,35
You have not dared to break the holy seal,35
All this we swear.,35
[Reads] Hermione is chaste;,35
a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;,35
which is lost be not found.,35
Praised!,35
Ay my lord; even so,35
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:,35
Enter Servant,35
What is the business?,35
The prince your son with mere conceit and fear,35
How! gone!,35
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves,35
HERMIONE swoons,35
This news is mortal to the queen: look down,35
Take her hence:,35
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:,35
Some remedies for life.,35
Apollo pardon,35
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,35
Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy;,35
To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose,35
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,35
My swift command though I with death and with,35
Not doing 't and being done: he most humane,35
Unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here,35
Of all encertainties himself commended,35
Thorough my rust! and how his pity,35
Re-enter PAULINA,35
O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it,35
What fit is this good lady?,35
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?,35
Must I receive whose every word deserves,35
Together working with thy jealousies,35
For girls of nine O think what they have done,35
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.,35
That did but show thee of a fool inconstant,35
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,35
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon,35
To be or none or little; though a devil,35
Nor is't directly laid to thee the death,35
Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart,35
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not no,35
When I have said cry 'woe!' the queen the queen,35
and vengeance for't,35
The higher powers forbid!,35
Prevail not go and see: if you can bring,35
Heat outwardly or breath within I'll serve you,35
Do not repent these things for they are heavier,35
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees,35
Upon a barren mountain and still winter,35
To look that way thou wert.,35
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved,35
Say no more:,35
I' the boldness of your speech.,35
All faults I make when I shall come to know them,35
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd,35
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction,35
Let me be punish'd that have minded you,35
Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman:,35
I'll speak of her no more nor of your children;,35
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,35
Thou didst speak but well,35
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee bring me,35
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall,35
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit,35
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature,35
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me,35
Exeunt,35
Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child and a Mariner,35
The deserts of Bohemia?,35
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly,35
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry,35
Their sacred wills be done! Go get aboard;,35
I call upon thee.,35
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;,35
Of prey that keep upon't.,35
I'll follow instantly.,35
To be so rid o' the business.,35
Come poor babe:,35
the spirits o' the dead,35
Appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream,35
Sometimes her head on one side some another;,35
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,35
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,35
Became two spouts: the fury spent anon,35
Since fate against thy better disposition,35
Of my poor babe according to thine oath,35
There weep and leave it crying; and for the babe,35
I prithee call't. For this ungentle business,35
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so with shrieks,35
I did in time collect myself and thought,35
Yet for this once yea superstitiously,35
Hermione hath suffer'd death and that,35
Of King Polixenes it should here be laid,35
Of its right father. Blossom speed thee well!,35
Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty,35
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed,35
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I,35
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have,35
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!,35
I am gone for ever.,35
Enter a Shepherd,35
three-and-twenty or that youth would sleep out the,35
getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry,35
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty,35
best sheep which I fear the wolf will sooner find,35
the seaside browsing of ivy. Good luck an't be thy,35
pretty barne! A boy or a child I wonder? A,35
though I am not bookish yet I can read,35
some stair-work some trunk-work some,35
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for,35
but even now. Whoa ho hoa!,35
Hilloa loa!,35
on when thou art dead and rotten come hither. What,35
I have seen two such sights by sea and by land!,35
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust,35
Why boy how is it?,35
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the,35
sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em; now the,35
swallowed with yest and froth as you'ld thrust a,35
land-service to see how the bear tore out his,35
his name was Antigonus a nobleman. But to make an,35
it: but first how the poor souls roared and the,35
and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than,35
Name of mercy when was this boy?,35
sights: the men are not yet cold under water nor,35
now.,35
I would you had been by the ship side to have,35
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,35
dying I with things newborn. Here's a sight for,35
child! look thee here; take up take up boy;,35
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:,35
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth,35
This is fairy gold boy and 'twill prove so: up,35
We are lucky boy; and to be so still requires,35
boy the next way home.,35
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much,35
are hungry: if there be any of him left I'll bury,35
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that,35
sight of him.,35
Tis a lucky day boy and we'll do good deeds on't.,35
ACT IV,35
Enter Time the Chorus,35
Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error,35
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime,35
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried,35
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour,35
The same I am ere ancient'st order was,35
The times that brought them in; so shall I do,35
The glistering of this present as my tale,35
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing,35
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving,35
Gentle spectators that I now may be,35
I mentioned a son o' the king's which Florizel,35
To speak of Perdita now grown in grace,35
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news,35
A shepherd's daughter,35
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,35
If never yet that Time himself doth say,35
Exit,35
Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO,35
tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to,35
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though,35
desire to lay my bones there. Besides the penitent,35
sorrows I might be some allay or I o'erween to,35
As thou lovest me Camillo wipe not out the rest of,35
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to,35
made me businesses which none without thee can,35
them thyself or take away with thee the very,35
considered as too much I cannot to be more,35
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal,35
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that,35
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen,35
Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my,35
being gracious than they are in losing them when,35
Sir it is three days since I saw the prince. What,35
have missingly noted he is of late much retired,35
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.,35
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which,35
intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a,35
very nothing and beyond the imagination of his,35
I have heard sir of such a man who hath a,35
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.,35
fear the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou,35
appearing what we are have some question with the,35
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.,35
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.,35
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.,35
SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.,35
When daffodils begin to peer,35
Why then comes in the sweet o' the year;,35
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,35
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;,35
The lark that tirra-lyra chants,35
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,35
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time,35
But shall I go mourn for that my dear?,35
And when I wander here and there,35
If tinkers may have leave to live,35
Then my account I well may give,35
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds look to,35
being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise,35
drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is,35
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to,35
of it. A prize! a prize!,35
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod,35
shorn. what comes the wool to?,35
If the springe hold the cock's mine.,35
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound,35
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father,35
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for,35
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but,35
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden,35
nutmegs seven; a race or two of ginger but that I,35
raisins o' the sun.,35
Grovelling on the ground,35
O help me help me! pluck but off these rags; and,35
Alack poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay,35
O sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more,35
ones and millions.,35
great matter.,35
ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon,35
What by a horseman or a footman?,35
Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he,35
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,35
O good sir tenderly O!,35
O good sir softly good sir! I fear sir my,35
How now! canst stand?,35
Softly dear sir; good sir softly. You ha' done me,35
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.,35
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,35
any thing I want: offer me no money I pray you;,35
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?,35
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the,35
virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court.,35
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay,35
Vices I would say sir. I know this man well: he,35
process-server a bailiff; then he compassed a,35
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;,35
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.,35
wakes fairs and bear-baitings.,35
put me into this apparel.,35
but looked big and spit at him he'ld have run.,35
false of heart that way; and that he knew I warrant,35
How do you now?,35
walk: I will even take my leave of you and pace,35
Shall I bring thee on the way?,35
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our,35
Prosper you sweet sir!,35
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.,35
make not this cheat bring out another and the,35
put in the book of virtue!,35
Jog on jog on the foot-path way,35
A merry heart goes all the day,35
Exit,35
Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA,35
Do give a life: no shepherdess but Flora,35
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,35
Sir my gracious lord,35
O pardon that I name them! Your high self,35
With a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid,35
In every mess have folly and the feeders,35
To see you so attired sworn I think,35
I bless the time,35
Thy father's ground.,35
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness,35
To think your father by some accident,35
How would he look to see his work so noble,35
Should I in these my borrow'd flaunts behold,35
Apprehend,35
Humbling their deities to love have taken,35
Became a bull and bellow'd; the green Neptune,35
Golden Apollo a poor humble swain,35
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,35
Run not before mine honour nor my lusts,35
O but sir,35
Opposed as it must be by the power of the king:,35
Which then will speak that you must,35
Or I my life.,35
With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not,35
Or not my father's. For I cannot be,35
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,35
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing,35
Lift up your countenance as it were the day,35
We two have sworn shall come.,35
Stand you auspicious!,35
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,35
Enter Shepherd Clown MOPSA DORCAS and others with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised,35
This day she was both pantler butler cook,35
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,35
On his shoulder and his; her face o' fire,35
She would to each one sip. You are retired,35
The hostess of the meeting: pray you bid,35
A way to make us better friends more known.,35
That which you are mistress o' the feast: come on,35
As your good flock shall prosper.,35
It is my father's will I should take on me,35
To CAMILLO,35
Give me those flowers there Dorcas. Reverend sirs,35
Seeming and savour all the winter long:,35
And welcome to our shearing!,35
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages,35
Sir the year growing ancient,35
Of trembling winter the fairest,35
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,35
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not,35
Wherefore gentle maiden,35
For I have heard it said,35
With great creating nature.,35
Yet nature is made better by no mean,35
Which you say adds to nature is an art,35
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,35
By bud of nobler race: this is an art,35
The art itself is nature.,35
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,35
I'll not put,35
No more than were I painted I would wish,35
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;,35
The marigold that goes to bed wi' the sun,35
Of middle summer and I think they are given,35
I should leave grazing were I of your flock,35
Out alas!,35
Would blow you through and through.,35
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might,35
That wear upon your virgin branches yet,35
For the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall,35
That come before the swallow dares and take,35
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes,35
That die unmarried ere they can behold,35
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and,35
The flower-de-luce being one! O these I lack,35
To strew him o'er and o'er!,35
No like a bank for love to lie and play on;,35
But quick and in mine arms. Come take your flowers:,35
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine,35
What you do,35
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,35
Pray so; and for the ordering your affairs,35
A wave o' the sea that you might ever do,35
And own no other function: each your doing,35
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,35
O Doricles,35
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,35
With wisdom I might fear my Doricles,35
I think you have,35
To put you to't. But come; our dance I pray:,35
That never mean to part.,35
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever,35
But smacks of something greater than herself,35
He tells her something,35
The queen of curds and cream.,35
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry garlic,35
Now in good time!,35
Come strike up!,35
Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this,35
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself,35
Upon his own report and I believe it;,35
I think so too; for never gazed the moon,35
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and to be plain.,35
Who loves another best.,35
So she does any thing; though I report it,35
Do light upon her she shall bring him that,35
Enter Servant,35
door you would never dance again after a tabour and,35
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he,35
ears grew to his tunes.,35
love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful,35
indeed and sung lamentably.,35
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he,35
bawdry which is strange; with such delicate,35
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,35
the matter he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop do me,35
Whoop do me no harm good man.',35
Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited,35
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;,35
learnedly handle though they come to him by the,35
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you,35
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.,35
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.,35
You have of these pedlars that have more in them,35
Ay good brother or go about to think.,35
Lawn as white as driven snow;,35
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;,35
Bugle bracelet necklace amber,35
Golden quoifs and stomachers,35
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,35
Come buy of me come; come buy come buy;,35
If I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take,35
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.,35
not too late now.,35
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be he has,35
Is there no manners left among maids? will they,35
faces? Is there not milking-time when you are,35
secrets but you must be tittle-tattling before all,35
your tongues and not a word more.,35
and a pair of sweet gloves.,35
and lost all my money?,35
therefore it behoves men to be wary.,35
I hope so sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.,35
Pray now buy some: I love a ballad in print o',35
Here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's,35
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and,35
Is it true think you?,35
Bless me from marrying a usurer!,35
Tale-porter and five or six honest wives that were,35
Pray you now buy it.,35
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.,35
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,35
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was,35
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that,35
Is it true too think you?,35
my pack will hold.,35
This is a merry ballad but a very pretty one.,35
Why this is a passing merry one and goes to,35
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in,35
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part thou,35
We had the tune on't a month ago.,35
occupation; have at it with you.,35
Get you hence for I must go,35
Whither?,35
Whither?,35
Thou to me thy secrets tell.,35
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.,35
Neither.,35
Neither.,35
Thou hast sworn it more to me:,35
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my,35
not trouble them. Come bring away thy pack after,35
have the first choice. Follow me girls.,35
And you shall pay well for 'em.,35
Will you buy any tape,35
My dainty duck my dear-a?,35
Any toys for your head,35
Come to the pedlar;,35
That doth utter all men's ware-a.,35
Re-enter Servant,35
three neat-herds three swine-herds that have made,35
Saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches,35
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind if it,35
bowling it will please plentifully.,35
homely foolery already. I know sir we weary you.,35
these four threes of herdsmen.,35
danced before the king; and not the worst of the,35
Leave your prating: since these good men are,35
Why they stay at door sir.,35
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs,35
To CAMILLO,35
He's simple and tells much.,35
How now fair shepherd!,35
Your mind from feasting. Sooth when I was young,35
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd,35
To her acceptance; you have let him go,35
Interpretation should abuse and call this,35
For a reply at least if you make a care,35
Old sir I know,35
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd,35
But not deliver'd. O hear me breathe my life,35
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand this hand,35
Or Ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd,35
By the northern blasts twice o'er.,35
How prettily the young swain seems to wash,35
But to your protestation; let me hear,35
Do and be witness to 't.,35
And he and more,35
That were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,35
That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge,35
Without her love; for her employ them all;,35
Or to their own perdition.,35
This shows a sound affection.,35
Say you the like to him?,35
So well nothing so well; no nor mean better:,35
The purity of his.,35
And friends unknown you shall bear witness to 't:,35
Her portion equal his.,35
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,35
Enough then for your wonder. But come on,35
Come your hand;,35
Soft swain awhile beseech you;,35
I have: but what of him?,35
He neither does nor shall.,35
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest,35
Is not your father grown incapable,35
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?,35
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing,35
No good sir;,35
Than most have of his age.,35
You offer him if this be so a wrong,35
Should choose himself a wife but as good reason,35
But fair posterity should hold some counsel,35
I yield all this;,35
Which 'tis not fit you know I not acquaint,35
Let him know't.,35
Prithee let him.,35
Let him my son: he shall not need to grieve,35
Come come he must not.,35
Mark your divorce young sir,35
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base,35
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,35
But shorten thy life one week. And thou fresh piece,35
The royal fool thou copest with--,35
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made,35
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh,35
I mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession;,35
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:,35
Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee,35
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea him too,35
Unworthy thee--if ever henceforth thou,35
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,35
As thou art tender to't.,35
Even here undone!,35
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,35
Hides not his visage from our cottage but,35
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,35
Being now awake I'll queen it no inch farther,35
Why how now father!,35
I cannot speak nor think,35
You have undone a man of fourscore three,35
To die upon the bed my father died,35
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me,35
That knew'st this was the prince,35
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!,35
To die when I desire.,35
Why look you so upon me?,35
But nothing alter'd: what I was I am;,35
My leash unwillingly.,35
You know your father's temper: at this time,35
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly,35
Then till the fury of his highness settle,35
I not purpose it.,35
Even he my lord.,35
How often said my dignity would last,35
It cannot fail but by,35
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together,35
From my succession wipe me father; I,35
Be advised.,35
Will thereto be obedient I have reason;,35
Do bid it welcome.,35
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;,35
Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may,35
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides,35
To this my fair beloved: therefore I pray you,35
When he shall miss me--as in faith I mean not,35
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune,35
And so deliver I am put to sea,35
And most opportune to our need I have,35
For this design. What course I mean to hold,35
Concern me the reporting.,35
I would your spirit were easier for advice,35
Hark Perdita,35
I'll hear you by and by.,35
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if,35
Save him from danger do him love and honour,35
And that unhappy king my master whom,35
Now good Camillo;,35
I leave out ceremony.,35
You have heard of my poor services i' the love,35
Very nobly,35
To speak your deeds not little of his care,35
Well my lord,35
And through him what is nearest to him which is,35
If your more ponderous and settled project,35
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving,35
Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see,35
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,35
Your discontenting father strive to qualify,35
How Camillo,35
That I may call thee something more than man,35
Have you thought on,35
Not any yet:,35
To what we wildly do so we profess,35
Of every wind that blows.,35
This follows if you will not change your purpose,35
And there present yourself and your fair princess,35
She shall be habited as it becomes,35
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping,35
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands,35
Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one,35
Faster than thought or time.,35
What colour for my visitation shall I,35
Sent by the king your father,35
The manner of your bearing towards him with,35
Things known betwixt us three I'll write you down:,35
What you must say; that he shall not perceive,35
And speak his very heart.,35
There is some sap in this.,35
Than a wild dedication of yourselves,35
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,35
Nothing so certain as your anchors who,35
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know,35
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together,35
One of these is true:,35
But not take in the mind.,35
There shall not at your father's house these,35
Be born another such.,35
She is as forward of her breeding as,35
I cannot say 'tis pity,35
To most that teach.,35
I'll blush you thanks.,35
But O the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,35
The medicine of our house how shall we do?,35
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.,35
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes,35
To have you royally appointed as if,35
That you may know you shall not want one word.,35
Re-enter AUTOLYCUS,35
sworn brother a very simple gentleman! I have sold,35
ribbon glass pomander brooch table-book ballad,35
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who,35
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:,35
picture; and what I saw to my good use I,35
be a reasonable man grew so in love with the,35
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the,35
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket it,35
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in,35
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this,35
festival purses; and had not the old man come in,35
son and scared my choughs from the chaff I had not,35
CAMILLO FLORIZEL and PERDITA come forward,35
So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt.,35
Shall satisfy your father.,35
All that you speak shows fair.,35
Seeing AUTOLYCUS,35
Nothing may give us aid.,35
How now good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear,35
I am a poor fellow sir.,35
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must,35
--thou must think there's a necessity in't--and,35
pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee,35
I am a poor fellow sir.,35
I know ye well enough.,35
flayed already.,35
Aside,35
Dispatch I prithee.,35
conscience take it.,35
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments,35
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself,35
And pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face,35
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--,35
Get undescried.,35
That I must bear a part.,35
Have you done there?,35
He would not call me son.,35
Giving it to PERDITA,35
Adieu sir.,35
Pray you a word.,35
Of this escape and whither they are bound;,35
To force him after: in whose company,35
I have a woman's longing.,35
Thus we set on Camillo to the sea-side.,35
Exeunt FLORIZEL PERDITA and CAMILLO,35
open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is,35
also to smell out work for the other senses. I see,35
What an exchange had this been without boot! What,35
this year connive at us and we may do any thing,35
iniquity stealing away from his father with his,35
honesty to acquaint the king withal I would not,35
and therein am I constant to my profession.,35
Aside aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:,35
hanging yields a careful man work.,35
There is no other way but to tell the king,35
Nay but hear me.,35
Go to then.,35
and blood has not offended the king; and so your,35
those things you found about her those secret,35
done let the law go whistle: I warrant you.,35
son's pranks too; who I may say is no honest man,35
me the king's brother-in-law.,35
could have been to him and then your blood had been,35
[Aside]  Very wisely puppies!,35
fardel will make him scratch his beard.,35
may be to the flight of my master.,35
[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest I am so,35
Takes off his false beard,35
To the palace an it like your worship.,35
of that fardel the place of your dwelling your,35
thing that is fitting to be known discover.,35
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no,35
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for,35
they do not give us the lie.,35
had not taken yourself with the manner.,35
Whether it like me or no I am a courtier. Seest,35
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?,35
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,35
business I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier,35
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to,35
My business sir is to the king.,35
I know not an't like you.,35
have none.,35
How blessed are we that are not simple men!,35
Therefore I will not disdain.,35
His garments are rich but he wears,35
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:,35
on's teeth.,35
Wherefore that box?,35
which none must know but the king; and which he,35
speech of him.,35
Why sir?,35
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,35
know the king is full of grief.,35
married a shepherd's daughter.,35
the curses he shall have the tortures he shall,35
Think you so sir?,35
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to,35
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,35
ram-tender to offer to have his daughter come into,35
is too soft for him say I draw our throne into a,35
Has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear. an't,35
He has a son who shall be flayed alive; then,35

are to be smiled at their offences being so,35
men what you have to the king: being something,35
aboard tender your persons to his presence,35
besides the king to effect your suits here is man,35
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,35
bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show,35
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned' and 'flayed alive.',35
us here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much,35
After I have done what I promised?,35
Well give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?,35
one I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.,35
he'll be made an example.,35
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your,35
will give you as much as this old man does when the,35
pawn till it be brought you.,35
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the,35
We are blest in this man as I may say even blest.,35
Exeunt Shepherd and Clown,35
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am,35
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how,35
these two moles these blind ones aboard him: if he,35
complaint they have to the king concerns him,35
officious; for I am proof against that title and,35
them: there may be matter in it.,35
ACT V,35
Enter LEONTES CLEOMENES DION PAULINA and Servants,35
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,35
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,35
With them forgive yourself.,35
Her and her virtues I cannot forget,35
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,35
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man,35
True too true my lord:,35
Or from the all that are took something good,35
Would be unparallel'd.,35
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me,35
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now good now,35
Not at all good lady:,35
Have done the time more benefit and graced,35
You are one of those,35
If you would not so,35
Of his most sovereign name; consider little,35
May drop upon his kingdom and devour,35
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?,35
For present comfort and for future good,35
With a sweet fellow to't?,35
Respecting her that's gone. Besides the gods,35
For has not the divine Apollo said,35
That King Leontes shall not have an heir,35
Is all as monstrous to our human reason,35
And come again to me; who on my life,35
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,35
To LEONTES,35
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander,35
Was like to be the best.,35
Who hast the memory of Hermione,35
Had squared me to thy counsel! then even now,35
Have taken treasure from her lips--,35
More rich for what they yielded.,35
No more such wives; therefore no wife: one worse,35
Again possess her corpse and on this stage,35
And begin 'Why to me?',35
She had just cause.,35
To murder her I married.,35
Were I the ghost that walk'd I'ld bid you mark,35
You chose her; then I'ld shriek that even your ears,35
Should be 'Remember mine.',35
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;,35
Will you swear,35
Never Paulina; so be blest my spirit!,35
You tempt him over-much.,35
As like Hermione as is her picture,35
Good madam--,35
Yet if my lord will marry--if you will sir,35
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young,35
As walk'd your first queen's ghost,35
To see her in your arms.,35
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.,35
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;,35
Enter a Gentleman,35
Son of Polixenes with his princess she,35
To your high presence.,35
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,35
Tis not a visitation framed but forced,35
But few,35
His princess say you with him?,35
That e'er the sun shone bright on.,35
As every present time doth boast itself,35
Give way to what's seen now! Sir you yourself,35
Is colder than that theme 'She had not been,35
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,35
Pardon madam:,35
The other when she has obtain'd your eye,35
Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal,35
Of who she but bid follow.,35
Women will love her that she is a woman,35
The rarest of all women.,35
Yourself assisted with your honour'd friends,35
Exeunt CLEOMENES and others,35
Had our prince,35
Well with this lord: there was not full a month,35
Prithee no more; cease; thou know'st,35
When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches,35
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.,35
Your mother was most true to wedlock prince;,35
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,35
His very air that I should call you brother,35
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!,35
I lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth,35
You gracious couple do: and then I lost--,35
Amity too of your brave father whom,35
Once more to look on him.,35
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him,35
Can send his brother: and but infirmity,35
His wish'd ability he had himself,35
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--,35
And those that bear them living.,35
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir,35
So rarely kind are as interpreters,35
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too,35
At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune,35
The adventure of her person?,35
She came from Libya.,35
That noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved?,35
His tears proclaim'd his parting with her: thence,35
To execute the charge my father gave me,35
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;,35
Not only my success in Libya sir,35
Here where we are.,35
Purge all infection from our air whilst you,35
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,35
For which the heavens taking angry note,35
As he from heaven merits it with you,35
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,35
Enter a Lord,35
That which I shall report will bear no credit,35
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;,35
His dignity and duty both cast off--,35
A shepherd's daughter.,35
Here in your city; I now came from him:,35
My marvel and my message. To your court,35
Of this fair couple meets he on the way,35
Her brother having both their country quitted,35
Camillo has betray'd me;,35
Endured all weathers.,35
He's with the king your father.,35
Camillo sir; I spake with him; who now,35
Wretches so quake: they kneel they kiss the earth;,35
Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them,35
O my poor father!,35
Our contract celebrated.,35
We are not sir nor are we like to be;,35
The odds for high and low's alike.,35
Is this the daughter of a king?,35
When once she is my wife.,35
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,35
Where you were tied in duty and as sorry,35
That you might well enjoy her.,35
Though Fortune visible an enemy,35
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you sir,35
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,35
My father will grant precious things as trifles.,35
Which he counts but a trifle.,35
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month,35
Than what you look on now.,35
Even in these looks I made.,35
But your petition,35
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,35
I now go toward him; therefore follow me,35
Exeunt,35
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman,35
I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old,35
whereupon after a little amazedness we were all,35
heard the shepherd say he found the child.,35
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the,35
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost with,35
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness language,35
of a world ransomed or one destroyed: a notable,35
beholder that knew no more but seeing could not,35
extremity of the one it must needs be.,35
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.,35
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the,35
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers,35
Enter a third Gentleman,35
deliver you more. How goes it now sir? this news,35
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king,35
Most true if ever truth were pregnant by,35
see there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle,35
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they,35
creature in resemblance of the mother the affection,35
and many other evidences proclaim her with all,35
the meeting of the two kings?,35
Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen,35
joy crown another so and in such manner that it,35
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,35
distraction that they were to be known by garment,35
himself for joy of his found daughter as if that,35
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then,35
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old,35
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such,35
and undoes description to do it.,35
hence the child?,35
rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear,35
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his,35
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.,35
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and,35
instruments which aided to expose the child were,35
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in,35
her husband another elevated that the oracle was,35
and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin,35
of losing.,35
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.,35
angled for mine eyes caught the water though not,35
death with the manner how she came to't bravely,35
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till from one,35
I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my,35
colour; some swooned all sorrowed: if all the world,35
Are they returned to the court?,35
which is in the keeping of Paulina--a piece many,35
Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself,35
beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her,35
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of,35
are they gone and there they intend to sup.,35
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever,35
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece,35
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?,35
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.,35
Exeunt Gentlemen,35
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old,35
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he,35
so he then took her to be who began to be much,35
weather continuing this mystery remained,35
been the finder out of this secret it would not,35
Enter Shepherd and Clown,35
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.,35
daughters will be all gentlemen born.,35
this other day because I was no gentleman born.,35
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say,35
lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.,35
Ay and have been so any time these four hours.,35
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my,35
called me brother; and then the two kings called my,35
the princess my sister called my father father; and,35
tears that ever we shed.,35
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck being in so,35
I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the,35
me your good report to the prince my master.,35
gentlemen.,35
Ay an it like your good worship.,35
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.,35
Not swear it now I am a gentleman? Let boors and,35
How if it be false son?,35
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to,35
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no,35
drunk: but I'll swear it and I would thou wouldst,35
I will prove so sir to my power.,35
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not,35
and the princes our kindred are going to see the,35
good masters.,35
SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.,35
O grave and good Paulina the great comfort,35
What sovereign sir,35
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,35
Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit,35
My life may last to answer.,35
We honour you with trouble: but we came,35
Have we pass'd through not without much content,35
That which my daughter came to look upon,35
As she lived peerless,35
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon,35
Lonely apart. But here it is: prepare,35
Still sleep mock'd death: behold and say 'tis well.,35
I like your silence it the more shows off,35
Comes it not something near?,35
Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed,35
In thy not chiding for she was as tender,35
Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing,35
O not by much.,35
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her,35
As now she might have done,35
Now piercing to my soul. O thus she stood,35
As now it coldly stands when first I woo'd her!,35
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,35
My evils conjured to remembrance and,35
Standing like stone with thee.,35
And do not say 'tis superstition that,35
Dear queen that ended when I but began,35
O patience!,35
My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on,35
So many summers dry; scarce any joy,35
But kill'd itself much sooner.,35
Let him that was the cause of this have power,35
Will piece up in himself.,35
If I had thought the sight of my poor image,35
I'ld not have show'd it.,35
No longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy,35
Let be let be.,35
What was he that did make it? See my lord,35
Did verily bear blood?,35
The very life seems warm upon her lip.,35
As we are mock'd with art.,35
My lord's almost so far transported that,35
O sweet Paulina,35
No settled senses of the world can match,35
I am sorry sir I have thus far stirr'd you: but,35
Do Paulina;,35
As any cordial comfort. Still methinks,35
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,35
Good my lord forbear:,35
You'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own,35
No not these twenty years.,35
Stand by a looker on.,35
Quit presently the chapel or resolve you,35
I'll make the statue move indeed descend,35
Which I protest against--I am assisted,35
What you can make her do,35
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy,35
It is required,35
On: those that think it is unlawful business,35
Proceed:,35
Music awake her; strike!,35
Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;,35
I'll fill your grave up: stir nay come away,35
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:,35
Start not; her actions shall be holy as,35
Until you see her die again; for then,35
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age,35
O she's warm!,35
Lawful as eating.,35
She hangs about his neck:,35
Ay and make't manifest where she has lived,35
That she is living,35
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,35
Please you to interpose fair madam: kneel,35
Our Perdita is found.,35
And from your sacred vials pour your graces,35
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found,35
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle,35
Myself to see the issue.,35
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble,35
You precious winners all; your exultation,35
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there,35
Lament till I am lost.,35
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,35
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;,35
As I thought dead and have in vain said many,35
For him I partly know his mind--to find thee,35
And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty,35
By us a pair of kings. Let's from this place.,35
That e'er I put between your holy looks,35
And son unto the king who heavens directing,35
Lead us from hence where we may leisurely,35
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first,35
Exeunt,35
